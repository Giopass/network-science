I made some of the most delicious chocolate chip cookies using coconut sugar, and they were so tender and amazing.",
m5z4ezc,t1_m5ywcny,1hw29bw,"Excellent thank you for this, I get it now. 
Isn’t coconut oil like, really bad for you though? Like worse than regular dairy butter? I’m not insulting or anything I want to try it, I’m just not trying to switch out bad for worse product ya know what I mean?",
m5ydrsd,t1_m5y8nlo,1hw29bw,That sounds soo good and reminded me of how much I love coconut sugar! I need to pick some up next time I'm at the store.,
m5yahcl,t1_m5y8nlo,1hw29bw,"do you have a recipe for those, please?",
m5z6lz4,t1_m5z4ezc,1hw29bw,"you're welcome!

not particularly. it's high in saturated fat but the same is the case for dairy butter. oil/fats are always going to be unhealthy in excess. the butter i linked is technically a ""cleaner"" product than dairy butter - folks will argue ""well it's just cream and salt"" (maybe cultures too) while ignoring the fact that dairy cows consume feed with additives, affecting the milk they produce. 

if you happen to be lactose intolerant (a lot of people are since we have not evolved to drink breastmilk from other species!), dairy butter probably won't bug you much because it's mostly fat, but assuming you have no intolerance to nuts you'd probably enjoy the kind i linked just as much as dairy.",
m5z59ef,t1_m5z4ezc,1hw29bw,Bad in what way?,
m60hyuz,t1_m5z4ezc,1hw29bw,"I mean, I feel like relatively speaking eating cookies with milk butter vs eating cookies with coconut oil is the same thing. Neither are healthy for you, they are cookies filled with fat and sugar. Although personally I haven't seen any research suggesting that coconut oil in particular is unhealthy, it may be.",
m61p01o,t1_m5z4ezc,1hw29bw,"Neither are good for you, but this is a cookie sooooo",
m5ycin0,t1_m5yahcl,1hw29bw,https://www.reddit.com/r/VeganBaking/s/qLkNKITMZt,
m5z5slt,t1_m5z59ef,1hw29bw,"Like worse for you in relation to clogging arteries and bad for kidneys. 
I understand with regular butter it’s like comparing apples to oranges…",
m61xo18,t1_m60hyuz,1hw29bw,"And I get that, it’s a piss poor thing to dispute. I guess what I’m going for is I’ve heard (but not actually seen) research suggesting the higher level of saturated fats in coconut oil is worse for you than regular dairy butter. Although, again let me be clear here, butter is shit bad for your system no matter what I get that. Also yes, of course chocolate and sugar is bad for you as well-hell everything is man at this point. 

Course the solution to that is to not bake and eat salad forever with nothing else.",
m61xrpk,t1_m61p01o,1hw29bw,"Yep again I get that, just trying to see out of the two would you be better off consuming if you were to make and eat said cookie soooo",
m62bsst,t1_m61xo18,1hw29bw,"Yeah and you’re right about that, coconut oil does have higher saturated fat, and butter has higher cholesterol while coconut oil has none so in my opinion it’s more or less a tossup. Neither are particularly healthy for you, especially in the context of “what fatty substance should I use for my cookies” lol. 

I think the occasional indulgence in cookies is fine whether you choose to use dairy butter or coconut oil, but you are on a vegan baking subreddit so you aren’t going to get anybody on here recommending butter made of milk that was stolen from a baby cow over coconut oil.",
m63a4ps,t1_m61xrpk,1hw29bw,You're on a vegan baking subreddit ,
m63jq40,t1_m62bsst,1hw29bw,"Heard.

I wanted to do a funfetti cake because I hadn’t done one before, I can’t really say what possessed me to give it a face, but I took that fleeting thought and ran with it 😂",😅😂
leaq7ao,t1_leaij8o,1dip47t,"Thank you so much! I’m not a professional but I’m actually in the process of putting together a portfolio so I can try working at a bakery

As for the batter, I generally fill pans 1/2 or 3/4 of the way up. To make the layers perfectly even, I use my digital kitchen scale to weigh each pan. I’ll scoop a little out of one and put it in another in order to get them as close in weight as possible

For the frosting, it’s really a preference thing I think. I just kind of plop on enough so that it looks proportionate to me (cake layer thickness to frosting thickness). I know some people like to pipe their frosting onto and inside of the cake, that seems to help make it all a uniform thickness but I just wing it

The vast majority of my cake recipes are from Gretchen’s Vegan Bakery [on YouTube](https://youtube.com/@gretchensveganbakery?si=6yURcaSmv96rxYea). I’ve been following her for many years and I love everything she makes. Sometimes I’ll go months without baking and then she uploads a new video that inspires me",

Starting a tutorial channel is one of my goals! I’m so BAD with videos and editing though rofl. I’m slowly learning how to do all the technical stuff, and do plan to start posting my vegan cooking and baking tutorials down the line! 

Heehe the naked cake! I’m sure it still tasted divine! ❤️",💕❤

m2nd2k1,t1_m2jwydk,1hgbivm,"Sure thing! ❤️

250g salted European style butter, 250g unsalted European style butter, 1-2 tbsp vanilla bean paste or vanilla extract, 1-2 tbsp creamy plant milk (go for oat, soy or cashew if you can), and 6-8 cups of powdered sugar. 

Using the paddle attachment for your mixer, cream your softened butter. Then add your vanilla. Add your powdered sugar one cup at a time, mixing well between each addition and scraping the sides and bottom of the bowl to prevent unmixed clumps. Add in your milk if you wish. 

The type of butter is the key ingredient here. If you can find Violife salted & unsalted butter, you’re golden. I find that no other vegan butter works nearly as well. The oils in other brands make them unable to hold their shape when decorating and also lend a more greasy/salty flavor. I think I’ve heard some good comments about Miyokos being a good alternative, but I’ve never personally tried making buttercream with it yet. 

I hope this helps! Happy baking love ❤️ ✨😊",❤❤✨😊

m2nbpps,t1_m2kg2do,1hgbivm,"Sure! ❤️

I use: 250g unsalted European style vegan butter, 250g salted European style vegan butter, 1-2 tablespoons of vanilla bean paste or vanilla extract, 1-2 tbsp of a creamy plant milk of your choice (I prefer oat, soy or cashew), and anywhere from 6-8 cups of powdered sugar. The butter is the most important party here. Things like Earth Balance etc will not work well or taste good. If you can, get your hands on Violife butter or I’ve also heard good things about Miyoko’s. 

Cream your softened butter first, then add in your vanilla bean paste and 1 cup of powdered sugar at a time, beating well between each addition and making sure to scrape down the sides and bottom of the bowl. Add in your milk if you wish and mix well, this is optional though!

Use a paddle attachment on your mixer and not the whisk - I find the whisk creates tons of air bubbles which make for less smooth decoration and more need for patch fixing. 

I hope this helps 😊❤️✨",❤😊❤✨

m2rniec,t1_m2rkz1m,1hgbivm,"That happened to me with this order actually haha. For the chocolate cupcakes, I had to make the chocolate espresso buttercream using only salted butter and it turned out great, not salty at all. So you could easily get away with making a flavored buttercream and be fine. It may be more noticeable with a straight up vanilla, but it really depends on the salt content in the butter. Some brands contain more than others. 

Hmm. I have also heard good things about Miyoko's butter (it comes in both unsalted and salted as well) and Trader Joe's apparently has a European style butter too that's worth trying.",
m6gcwqn,t3_1hyc4fw,1hyc4fw,"I think it looks pretty good! Did you use fresh strawberries or freeze dried powder? I always use powdered for my strawberry frosting to avoid any extra moisture. It looks like it might have gotten a bit warm to me. Were your cakes completely cooled before you iced it? My go-to buttercream is 2 sticks Country Crock olive oil sticks, 4 cups powdered sugar, 2-4 T liquid of choice. For strawberry I would add 4-6T powdered strawberry and soy milk to the consistency I want.",

m6gba1t,t3_1hyc4fw,1hyc4fw,"What do you mean by smoother? If you still feel the consistency of the powdered sugar there might be many reasons:
It could be underdone, in such case you need to whip it some more.
It could be saturated, in which case you could add a little cream or milk, one teaspoon at the time, and whip again.
I find that mine, if slightly over saturated, will be smoother after a day in the fridge (sugar kept dissolving over time).

Good job on the cake, looks super tasty!",
m6h0qra,t3_1hyc4fw,1hyc4fw,"This looks pretty close to the texture of the frosting in the recipe pictures, though it's possible you added too much liquid. This could be from either fresh strawberries (which I don't recommend in frosting) or milk/cream (which I find vegan frostings rarely need).

m6v2nbx,t1_m6gcwqn,1hyc4fw,Thank you for the tips! I used fresh strawberries reduced down to a paste consistency. My cakes were cool but I’m thinking the buttercream got warm with my hands while I was piping. I’ll try country crock next time!,
m6v1q4g,t1_m6ias0q,1hyc4fw,thank you for the reminder!! I do wrap the stems and these ones are dried but tbh I probably shouldn’t use them,
m6h0x1t,t1_m6gba1t,1hyc4fw,"I think OP meant smoother as in how the frosting looks on the cake, not how the texture felt in their tongue. Especially because the piping lines don't look crusty from too much sugar like they would if it was too dry of a buttercream.

To OP: at first I thought your buttercream looked like it had too much sugar in it, which makes it stiff and leads to breaking of lines when piping.

But then I zoomed in on your picture and the smooth issue seems to be two-fold. First, the air bubbles are showing up in your frosting and maybe even look more pronounced because the shadows in the air pockets look darker because of this shade of frosting. The extra air also probably contributed to some of the blobs to look a little droopy. You could try whipping the frosting a little less so you don't have quite so many air pockets, or just manually beating it with a spatula in the bowl right after you're done mixing to get rid of the larger air pockets. 

Second, you seem to be using one round piping tip rather than a fluted piping tip. Because there are no ridges in the piping tip to pop small air bubbles as the frosting is coming out, all the air pockets are showing in your piping lines.  And while I do like the design you used, using a variety of tip ends and sizes can give your cake more visual contrast in piping lines so our eyes will be drawn to the variety of frosting shapes rather than the ""imperfections"" of the air pockets.",
m6v24dy,t1_m6h0qra,1hyc4fw,"Oooo thank you! I cooked down fresh strawberries to a paste consistency, but will probably go for freeze dried powder next time. I typically make a Swiss meringue buttercream and will definitely try this one out!!",

Factory farms are unethical for multiple reasons just as sweatshops in asia where people work in inhumane conditions is unethical. People are simply unaware of how much something should cost when its produced more ethically.  People used to spend a higher percentage of income on both food and clothing because people purchased better quality food and clothing. America has some of the lowest food prices in the world comparatively as well. Need to wake up and understand why super cheap stuff is not sustainable or ethical. People are too effing detached from how the things they purchase are made and its sad. Need to stop normalizing buying a shirt for $10-20, or eggs for 25 cents. The only reason why animal products in grocery stores are as cheap as they are anyways is because our govt hugely subsidizes them.",

I live in Germany.  
Following are the price from the big supermarket chain today for each type of eggs (based on how their barn is):  

Bodenhaltung (fully barn) : 1,99€ / 10 eggs  

Freilandhaltung (free range) : 2,29€ / 10 eggs  

Bio (organic) : 3,89€ / 10 eggs

What I take issue with, however, is you spewing vague generalized statements like, “for some ppl meat and eggs are necessary bc of GI disorders” without specificity regarding which disorders you are referring to. What I also find problematic is your generalized statement inferring that some people need meat and eggs to survive, which, again, I am casting into doubt without more information from you. I myself have type 2 DM and gerd and have thrived on a vegan diet. I am aware of severe and rare allergy cases interfering with being able to sustain a vegan diet without proper access to nutrition education and sufficient groceries. While that is reality and unfortunate, that is not strictly a health issue but is the intersection of many issues stemming from modern society as we know it.

And what’s hilarious is I’ve not said anything bad about anyone being a vegan, but I’ve been attacked for incorporating small amounts of meat and eggs into my diet. Ironic, isn’t it?

Second off, baked goods arn't a luxury. Wanting bread for a sandwich but only being able to afford the absolute cheapest bread, and if that bread has eggs in it, sometimes you cannot choose. Sometimes you're in jail and or prison and they only give you so much food. They aren't going to respect that you're vegan being blunt. 

I don't agree with that. I genuinely think that prisons as they are, are fucking evil. But I'm saying you cannot act like oh no ""excuses"" when not being able to control what you eat, is a very real thing when you're poor. 

There is no ethical consumption under capitalism. 

I think trying to reduce meat consumption, trying to go vegan or vegetarian, should be applauded even if you genuinely cannot forever. 

I also think that in prison reform we should respect people's dietary issues such as allergies and religious and faith based diets such as Halal. And if you're vegan I think you should be given that option. But I don't want to just improve the prisons so much as abolish them so",

There's actually a serious lack of intensive books and blogs about vegan baking. It's a huge amount of trial and error to figure out what works and what doesn't. I was extremely frustrated when I started vegan baking by being told to just substitute silken tofu or whatever and ending up with an objectively worse product. I'm excited by current innovations in vegan baking, but I hate when people don't acknowledge how difficult and dispiriting it can be to make that transition as someone who wants a specific final product.",

we are also not the only species to drink another’s milk. many puppies will nurse on cats and vice versa. 

you thinking that i said people should only eat meat and dont have reactions to it is sub par reading comprehension skills on your part. 

the whole point of why i joined here is bc in lactose’s intolerant and needed baking alternatives and liked a lot of the recipes here. apparently thats not allowed bc i eat meat so that i can sustain myself and heal parts of my body? thats wild. i also think its so fucking hilarious how vegans like you think if someone eats meat that means they eat it every meal and do not ever eat anything else

m1ztrzt,t1_m1zrhk9,1hcu85c,"no, not classist. killing animals is unethical. i don't care the class of the person who does it-- if there's another option available to them, and they don't take that option, they're acting unethically.

note that you're now not talking about baking for yourself, and instead have shifted to talking about purchasing pre-baked goods. no matter. the cheapest bread at every store i've been to is vegan. but i think you have a misunderstanding of veganism. if someone has no choice, then ethics don't apply. meaning, if a prisoner's only choice are animal products, they're not acting immorally by consuming them. or if a dirt poor person needs bread to live, and the only bread they can afford has animal products, then there's no choice so morals need not apply.

but recall that i was talking about creating your own baked goods. you've moved the goalpost to something else entirely.

""there is no ethical consumption under capitalism"" is a terrible argument to do anything. just because all consumption involves exploitation, does this mean it's fruitless to refuse the absolute worst, most unethical types of consumption? this is a way to absolve yourself of responsibility for what you pay for. companies only do unethical things because a happy consumer buys it at the end of the line.

suppose a company produced a product that you liked a lot, & you did not need this product. if the company told you, ""with every 10 purchases, we kill a child!"" would you say ""well, no ethical consumption under capitalism"" and buy it anyways? that would be bizarre. perhaps no consumption is 100% ethical, but this doesn't mean that we shouldn't refuse to participate in the consumption that is 0% ethical.",

m1spkoi,t1_m1sl56p,1hcu85c,"How is the OP being annoying? They just stated a fact. They also did not repost the picture; they reposted the reddit thread. Because it was the comments they were talking about, not the photo. 

I never said we are the only mammals to eat eggs, I said one of the. Because statistically, very few species do.

Also, I didn't realize I had to clarify with milk that I wasn't talking about when they are 6 week old infants unable to see and hear. As adults, we are the only species to do so. In fact, the reason why so many people are lactose intolerant is because we are not made to drink milk after infancy. When animals stop breastfeeding, they lose the ability to fully digest lactose, as they no longer need it. The only reason this doesn't always happen to humans is because you only stop being able to digest lactose when you stop drinking it. If you continue to drink milk, you will continue to be able to digest it. Because to your body, it is still being breastfed, so it still needs to be able to digest lactose. 

I never claimed you said people should only eat eggs and milk. I said that there are not GI issues where that is all you can eat. Implying you can also eat other foods, so it is still possible to be vegan (but maybe more difficult). 

Again, I never claimed animal products are part of all of your meals. 

Also, no, you do not need meat to sustain and heal yourself. It may be easier, but clearly, it is not the only way.

And it seems you missed my point bringing up eating humans. No matter how much someone says it is best for their health, it is immoral. A large portion of vegans believe it is immoral to eat any species that is conscious and capable of feeling and expressing pain. And hopefully, someday, more people will recognize this. Potentially, even laws will follow. After all, cannibalism used to be common among humans.",
m1trevx,t1_m1t7q2r,1hcu85c,"im not denying people recovery, whatever that means. i am, in fact, recovering. mental illness isnt an excuse to actively contribute to the murder and torture of animals. animal exploitation is wrong and unnecessary. the animals are not here to make you feel better, their life is not ours to use. animals are not here for human benefit.",
m2ff0x9,t1_m1ztrzt,1hcu85c,"You don't care about the class of the other person doing it but ""if there is another option available and they're not taking it, they're unethical."" 

What if I told you that the reason pesticide holders have to be designed for children to hold is because this country uses child labor in picking your organic vegan salad. That when people designed it only for adults, children routinely were disfiguring themselves with pesticides and industrial chemicals because they were the ones out there, with their families, picking and growing your produce. 

Would you eat the salad?? 

But that's all you have to eat! You're disabled or Autistic! You struggle to even eat that! This is what you can AFFORD to eat. It what you know how to cook. 

But isn't it unethical for you to go forth eating produce in America knowing how we treat migrant farm workers and how they're exposed to horrific working conditions and that whole families work in the fields because they can't afford child care??? 

It's almost as if you would do the best you can under the conditions you can.

you're trying to muddy the waters and say that everything is equally unethical. two things being unethical does not mean they are equally unethical. eating plants is much much more ethical than eating animals. moreover, due to the fact that we have to eat something, i do have to select the most ethical source of food available. what you're arguing for is to not have to be ethical in food choices.

m1tyt60,t1_m1syxuq,1hcu85c,"That simply is why people are lactose intolerant. There is more science behind it, but from an evolutionary standard, that is true. 

Also, I never claimed you should stop eating meat, and I'm sorry if that is how it sounded. I simply wanted to explain that, truly, people in general can get enough nutrients off of non-animal products to survive, even with allergies. Otherwise, how would the animals they eat have the needed nutrients? Veganism is possible but might not be an option for people. For example, a lot of grocery stores do not sell certain foods that can make being vegan an option. Like nutritional yeast is not always sold, but is such an easy way to get needed vitamins. Being vegan is not hard, but being vegan in the world we live in, which is already so pro meat, is. 

I do believe it is immoral to eat animals, but I also believe society pushes it upon people. Just like how I believe it is immoral to fly on airplanes as often as I do to visit family. While that aspect of me is immoral, I feel I do enough good to outweigh it. (Like fostering and volunteering for animal rescues). So, just a little context here that I believe you can do immoral things and still be a very moral person, and there are just necessary evils sometimes. For you, that might be eating meat. 

I believe a large difference here is I am talking more from the stance of it is possible, whereas you are talking more from your experience, in which it may not be a good option. 

Also, I wish you the best of luck with overcoming your eating disorder. I've been there too, and it really sucks.",
m1vnh3b,t1_m1tyt60,1hcu85c,"there are plenty of people that cannot get enough nutrients solely from plants because their body cannot absorb it properly since they have gastrointestinal disorders. I really don’t know why I have to keep saying this or why you choose to be uneducated about this. 

I genuinely don’t know why there are so many vegans that feel so entitled to telling other people what they should and shouldn’t eat. y’all freak out when someone who eats meat makes fun of you for being vegan or tries to convince u to eat meat or whatever else, but the moment it’s flipped it’s fine. It’s very hypocritical. there has not been a single time that I have sat here and I’ve tried to tell you that you should eat meat because that’s not my place but there have been multiple times that multiple people have told me that I should be vegan because I’m a bad person for eating meat

it is not immoral for me to be healthy, but if that’s what you think then that’s pretty ableist. 

like it’s hilarious that you’re literally saying veganism might not be an option for everyone yet in the same comment, you’re still condemning people for not being vegan like you’re just not making any sense. 

and no, I’m not talking solely from my experience. I’m talking from the experience of people that have told me and that I have viewed with my own eyes. Like I don’t know why you think this is fake. That’s genuinely weird. People are allowed to eat meat and still be good people and I don’t know how to change your mind but I quite honestly don’t fucking care. If you want to think people who eat meat are bad people that’s fine, but I think people who judge other people for what they eat are the real bad people.

I will be blocking from here on out because this should not go on for days and it’s also super disappointing to have to leave a community where I was getting recipes from to help me bake because I’m lactose intolerant.

lusccwd,t3_1ggbsur,1ggbsur,"Do you know if there's a way to start making them then you stop and freeze them so you can easily have fresh croissants in the morning?

As a kid, before I was vegan, I remember my parents buying frozen shaped but unbaked croissants.  They'd let them rise in the oven overnight and bake ""fresh"" in the morning.  

I wonder if that'd be doable with his recipe.

Also, for the step when you cut the dough in triangles, it says to use half the dough.  Considering that the double turn yields a 9"" x 6"" rectangle, I guess you cut it into a 4.5 x 6"" rectangle which you then roll into an 18"" x 20"" rectangle. Is that correct?",

luqb3pr,t1_luq5y5a,1ggbsur,I wanted to use Violife but I couldn't find it so i used a cheap vegan block that is available in my country. But Violife would definitely be better,
luq8v37,t1_luptn8i,1ggbsur,aww thanks 🤗,🤗
luqd3us,t1_luqcr7s,1ggbsur,That's so nice thank you :)),
luqpcv8,t1_luqfrfk,1ggbsur,Well the only difference is that I used vegan butter instead of regular and it doesn't contain coconut so no coconutty taste!,
lutpvuq,t1_lusccwd,1ggbsur,"I would do that after shaping (but I'm just an amateur so idk!), put them on a tray and freeze so they don't stick together. After they are frozen, I would put them in a bag. When you want to bake them just let them defrost and rise as normal (that would take longer). I thought of doing this myself it's a great idea :)) 

About cutting up the dough in half: I was also confused by that, because in the blog post she says to work with half the dough, but then in the recipe card she doesn't say anything. So what I've done is I just rolled out the whole dough and followed her instructions. I cut 10 triangles with no problems.",

I will try to freeze some after shaping otherwise I'll be left with 10 croissants to eat all by myself which wouldn't be a smart move on my part because I could and would eat them all in a day...

Edit: just noticed that the original recipe has some info about freezing (at the very bottom) either right after laminating or after shaping.",
lup3q34,t1_luozjkr,1ggbsur,Ooh let me know how it goes!! however i think the key is finding actually good vegan butter,

I found Flora's vegan butter that is exquisite, I think it will be perfect ! I also have access to croissant margarine that happens to be vegan but it's less tasty, maybe I'll test both !",
luud2ow,t1_lupesjs,1ggbsur,"I've been using Violife unsalted butter.  Comes in a 1lb brick, uses palm oil.  A friend recommended tourlami but it uses cocoa butter and is too crisp at refrigeration temps so I prefer not to use it.",

-  The strawberry matcha swirl: started with [this](https://chelsweets.com/swirled-christmas-cookies/#mv-creation-766-jtr) recipe, subbing earth balance and just egg. Omitted almond extract and used matcha for the green portion, freeze dried strawberry powder for the red. 

- Snickerdoodle latte: based on [this recipe](https://www.noracooks.com/gingerbread-latte-cookies/) switching the molasses out for brown sugar

- Polar bears and snowmen: based on [this non vegan recipe](https://chelsweets.com/snowman-cookies/#mv-creation-764-jtr) swapping in just egg and plant butter. I used violife block cream cheese (new product, I love it) and baked at 325F instead of 350 as is recommended by violife on their website. I also added the cheesecake flavor Lor Ann oil that is confirmed vegan on their website

(method adapted from The Preppy Kitchen)



4 large honeycrisp apples


1/4 cup white sugar


2/3 cup dark brown sugar


4 tbsp all purpose flour


1 tbsp ground cinnamon


1/4 tsp allspice


1/2 tsp cardamom



pie crust pastry: *mine was baked in an 8 inch pan 


 - 256g ap flour (1 3/4 cups)

 - 1 tbsp granulated sugar

 - 1/2 tsp salt

 - 195g vegan butter

 - 8 tbsp ice water


Aquafaba egg wash

  - 1:1 aquafaba & maple syrup

  - pinch of turmeric



Preheat oven 425F. Peel & core apples. Cut into 1/4"" slices. Add to large bowl with sugars, spices, & flour. Toss until apples are evenly coated & transfer mixture into your prepared unbaked pie crust. Brush top of pie with aquafaba egg wash. Bake for 20 minutes.

-Use Granny smith apples to balance sweet with tart. 

-Add some lemon squeezes to apple sugar cinnamon mixture to brighten apple flavor. 

-Add little pads of (vegan) butter cubes on top of apple layer before baking.

-When adding water to the dough have it in freezer while you prep or you can pull water from a container that has ice in it.
 
-Refrain from touching the dough with your hands as much as possible. 

-If dough gets too warm during prep, then put back in freezer for a little bit. 

-Splash a little water on the counter before putting down the bottom saran wrap so it sticks to surface.

-Roll out between 2 saran wrap sheets. Remove top saran, flip onto top of pie pan and gently nudge into pan before taking 2nd saran off.

-To prevent burning crust put tin foil over whole pie or just the crust halfway through baking.

lwf62e0,t3_1go0rdn,1go0rdn,Beautiful frosting!,
lwgktpt,t3_1go0rdn,1go0rdn,"Thanks for the kind words everyone! For those requesting a recipe:

Credit to u/nuggetsattack, I've been using this cake recipe as my baseline vanilla cake for years now: https://www.reddit.com/r/VeganBaking/s/4e7SvA5BI3

To the batter, I added toasted hazelnut pieces, orange zest, and warming spices.

The frosting is vanilla ermine with coconut milk, with hazelnut praline paste blended in. The darker frosting (which I also used for the filling) has a higher concentration of paste.

Honestly though, something was missing. I wanted to avoid chocolate (only because the last cake I made was chocolate), but a layer of mousse would have been wonderful. Or some dried fruits in the cake. Something to add moisture - it was a bit dry in the mouth with all the nuts. Luckily it was a low-pressure birthday party and everyone still enjoyed it.

I can't figure out how to add a picture in a comment to show the inside, but it was nothing special. Just a two-layer nutty cake with the filling described above.",

lwluxxq,t1_lwgktpt,1go0rdn,Do you have the ratio or measurements for the frosting?  I haven't made am ermine with coconut milk yet so that'd helpful.,
lwkbqt5,t1_lwjux5n,1go0rdn,I used a contoured cake scraper for the sides! I feel guilty that people are thinking I could achieve that evenness with piping lol. There's no way.,
lwmoq9f,t1_lwluxxq,1go0rdn,"Sure! Here's the recipe I use. I actually use the same ratio for any liquid (have used soy milk, oat milk, fresh squeezed fruit juice, and combinations of these liquids). Coconut milk just yields a slightly thicker and richer frosting.

35 grams flour

1 cup coconut milk

130 grams granulated sugar (can adjust this - it comes out not-super-sweet with this much sugar)

1 teaspoon vanilla extract

Pinch of salt

1 cup/ 230 grams vegan butter, softened (for a more stable frosting, use a 50/50 mixture of shortening and vegan butter)

Add flour to saucepan. Slowly whisk in milk, then add sugar. Over medium heat, bring to a simmer, whisking constantly, until it becomes very thick and almost pudding-like (maybe five minutes). Take care to scrape the bottom of the pan as you whisk to avoid burning.

Remove from heat, whisk in vanilla and salt. Pour into a bowl to allow it to cool completely. Put plastic wrap on the surface to keep a skin from forming. Chill overnight or for several hours (don't try to cheat this step! Needs to be solidly cold all the way through).

Use a mixer to beat the butter, scraping the sides of the bowl occasionally, about 5 minutes, until pale and fluffy. With the mixer on medium, add the cooled flour mixture a small scoop at a time. Continue to beat until the frosting becomes light and fluffy.

Edit: fixed some steps I missed/messed up.",

This was the recipe I used (just for the meringue) but I didn’t have any cream of tartar so I used lemon juice instead (I think I might have done a full tsp of lemon juice, I think you have to double the quantity for subbing cream of tartar)

But i cook a lot and I dont want piles of chickpeas and it's not that great in sponge cakes so i use potato protein, in every 100g water dissolve 3g potato protein and you can use it as egg whites",

ltx44i0,t1_ltwpfaz,1gctqs2,"So I would say it’s a little more fragile than regular meringue and maybe that chewiness on the inside isn’t exactly the same, but as a pavlova it’s pretty much exactly the same. I think you’d only notice differences if you ate the meringue on its own.

ltjjayg,t1_ltjdp0y,1gb6yhn,"I'm not sure if I'm allowed to link to non-vegan recipes. I got the recipe from ""Sugar Spun Run"" and veganized it. I used Country Crock Plant Butter, Trader Joe's vegan cream cheese, oatmilk + vinegar for the buttermilk, and Bob's egg replacer.",
ltjj6lj,t1_ltjdp0y,1gb6yhn,I second this. Need the recipe!!!,
ltl8kuy,t1_ltjjayg,1gb6yhn,It's actually so helpful to hear your alterations! Baking doesn't always turn out with vegan substitutions so I'm def gonna try this seeing how it turned out for you!,
lv80qxz,t1_ltjjayg,1gb6yhn,"I'm curious, did you just melt the butter or did you try to brown it? I was inspired by your post and made this for my Dad's birthday yesterday (using Ripple + vinegar, Violife cream cheese, and Just egg). Since vegan butter won't brown the same way as cow butter, I tried browning the butter (Country Crock) along with two teaspoons of natural almond butter. It worked really well!",
ltk5g05,t1_ltjjayg,1gb6yhn,Thank you!,
ltltr0v,t1_ltl8kuy,1gb6yhn,I've had a lot of luck doing vegan substitutions in cakes. I always try to find recipes with weight measurements too (more consistency). This was my very first time making butter pecan and I was nervous because I've never added nuts to a batter before. I went back and forth between using applesauce and Bob's. I think either would work. The cake batter was delicious. I'll be making cupcakes next time.,
lv83q60,t1_lv80qxz,1gb6yhn,"I melted it and cooked it on the stove for about 4-5 minutes. I know you can't truly brown vegan butter, but I did this anyway. I tried the almond butter technique once for cookies a few months ago and I really couldn't taste the difference, so I haven't done it again. I'm so glad it turned out well for you! ☺️ I made this again, but in cupcake and Bundt cake form. It's so good!",☺
lv89n0b,t1_lv83q60,1gb6yhn,"Oooh, maybe I'll try it both ways with something less complex and see for myself if I can tell a difference, then-- this was the first time I'd seen brown butter called for in a recipe I was veganizing, so I didn't want to miss out on the flavor. I'd also toasted the nuts which I think can give a similar profile? 

Thanks for answering, and thanks for posting this recipe-- I agree it's super delicious and was a huge hit!",

m2wtu09,t1_m2umam8,1hhp0c5,Right??,
m2v5ayx,t1_m2v20jv,1hhp0c5,"That one is a bit tricky.
Take thick plastic foil, cut it into 4x10cm and tempered chocolat, you dip the tip of a knife (with a pointy end) into the chocolat and put it onto the foils corner. Make sure to apply some pressure while pulling the knife towards you.
Next you'll need a baking sheet or something you can let your leafs harden in. I used two metal bars, close together.
Once your chocolate leafs are hardened, you can pick them up and arrange them how ever you like :)

The tarte is Avocado - Chocolate - Raspberry btw :)",
m6jtap9,t1_m6ftmxp,1hhp0c5,"Hallo Richard!

Lenotre war ein Visionär, unbestritten. Seine Rezepte erfordern, wie die meisten Backrezepte, aber nichts als Genauigkeit und Geschick  :)

Kirschtartelette kenne ich glaub ich nur unter dem Namen 'Clafouti' Die Kirschen werden in einer Mandelcreme im frisch gerollten Mürbteig gebacken, ein wunderbarer Klassiker. Achte darauf, dass der Mürbteig vor der Verarbeitung einen Tag im Kühlschrank ruht, damit sich der Zucker löst, sonst wird dein Teig beim Backen grobporig und porös und lässt sich schwieriger aus der Form lösen. Und die Form mit Trennwachs fetten, kleine Gebäcke lassen sich schlechter lösen und brechen oft (=Frustration).

Viel Erfolg und guten Appetit!",

Ganache : Two parts coconut cream (boiled) and one part dark chocolate (add a bit salt and vanilla)

 Vegan marshmallows 


For 'Schaumküsse' you'll need a thin layer of wafer, you can make a classical 'Hippenmasse', look up the recepie and use Oatmilk and Aquafaba instead of Eggwhite and Milk. When hot, you can press the pastrie into every shape. It's used for ice-cream-cones for ex.
When cold, you can use the vegan marshmallow to pipe a dome, let cool and cover with you favourite vegan chocolate :)

lde7grr,t1_ldd8k1w,1e46188,"Wacky cake is the best cake. Honestly! 

I don’t usually make vegan food, but this cake is vegan by nature, super simple, one bowl, and always a crowd pleaser. Most recipes are for chocolate but it’s easy enough to find a recipe for vanilla. 

The cake recipe was developed in the depression era when people didn’t necessarily have eggs or milk on hand. The cake is leavened with baking soda and vinegar!",
lde5aq2,t1_lddwoov,1e46188,"Ermine is one of my favorite kinds of frosting. The texture is similar to whipped cream so it’s wonderfully light, but it’s also very stable. This cake stood up to 90* outdoor temperatures and the frosting didn’t slide at all! 

It’s also less sweet than other types of frosting, which I like. Since ermine recipes don’t call for powdered sugar, I find that my kitchen ends up less sticky overall lol 

Try it out and let us know how it goes!!",

lde9du5,t1_lde6c77,1e46188,"Any ermine frosting recipe will work! Just sub dairy milk with a vegan replacement of your choice and the butter with your favorite plant-based option. I’d recommend a stick over a tub (which is true for almost all baking applications). 

The frosting is thickened and stabilized by cooking a “pudding” of milk, flour, and sugar together. When it’s thick, you cool it to room temp, and then whip it together with room temp butter. 

It’s very important that your pudding and butter are both room temp! Otherwise, they won’t incorporate smoothly. Also, I’d suggest that you scape down your bowl thoroughly several times during the whipping process so it all gets incorporated and aerated. 

You can see in my pic that some of the outside is a bit yellow. That’s due to frosting where the sides of the bowl weren’t thoroughly scraped and then I did touch ups with it. Looking back, that’s one thing I’d be more careful about in the future!",

i also did make some more cookie dough (edible kind hehe🌿) last night & used [this recipe](https://www.noracooks.com/vegan-chocolate-chip-cookies/)

and the donut holes are SUPERR simple! just mash up a ripe banana, the riper the better! and then add in self rising flour or regular flour + a tsp of baking powder. i do around 1/1.5 cups of flour, depends on how much banana youve got! once the dough comes together i made them into balls & airfried. once they’re out i put a dash of avocado oil on them to help the coconut sugar + cinnamon stick on better!

The design is piped on the bottom of the pan. Then I froze it for about 10 minutes.  Then I poured my regular favorite cake batter directly over the piped design (hence the need to freeze it a bit).  I baked it as I would normally bake my cakes.

I let it cool a bit, removed the cake from the pan upside down and VOILA! 

Hope this helps :)",

[Sponge cake by Bianca Zapatka](https://biancazapatka.com/en/vegan-sponge-cake/) - like I said, I may have done something wrong because I usually like her recipes but this batter was quite dense, which ended up being the perfect texture for piping.

lxr7u4q,t1_lxr4v1f,1gtu6ee,"Thank you!

The key to getting the colors right for the grey and the pink batter was using white food coloring first.  Yep, that's a thing!  

I used a gel kind for the white because that's all I could find and was really surprised with the result.  It completely or mostly removes the yellow tinge of the batter so the final color is brighter.  Then I used liposoluble powder food coloring.  I bought red, yellow, black and blue.  You need the tiniest amount to get vibrant colors.  Just make sure you stir it in very well otherwise you'll get streaks of undissolved powder.

Just add a little bit of powder food coloring at a time, like less than 1/4 of a pinch of salt - if that counts as measuring unit - into a couple tablespoons of batter, even less than that for the grey, stir well, double check with your reference image, adjust until you're satisfied.",

m4mexiv,t1_m4lc0vp,1hpwris,"not op, but I think I can help, you can achieve that by making a ganache, 55% chocolate, 45% cream, any cream you can heat.

Put your cream into the microwave and heat for a few seconds at a time until start to boil, then pour onto the chocolate and mix using and immersion blender until it gets homogenous and silky.

Let it cool until 95 to 105F or 35 to 40C, and decor using a spoon, the most important part is to respect this temperature interval, if hotter will drip too much and if cooler it would get chunky and visually unattractive.

I hope is clear enough to understand, English isn't my first language, if you have any doubt just ask, hope it's helpful",

ku1cfdn,t1_ku0fzn1,1b9o25w,I think it's an 8x8 pan because it says it makes 8 squares/servings.,
ku27xht,t1_ku0fzn1,1b9o25w,a standard US loafpan is 9x5 or sometimes 8.5 x 4.5 inches. you can use any pan as long as the batter thickness is about the same as you would expect brownie / oatmeal bars to be.,

[Royal icing video](https://youtu.be/9vTyzpjIRq0?si=RyM82ipFLNKOqBrG)

The only way I strayed from her recipe/process is that after I’ve beaten the aquafaba + cream of tartar, I switch to the paddle attachment to incorporate the confectioners sugar which helps prevent the final product from having big air bubbles",
l3mqsyv,t1_l3mp9f1,1cpk5iz,"Thank you so much. Tbh I’m kind of shocked at how they turned out lol. For the white base, I used stiff consistency to outline and then I used flood consistency to fill them in. I’ve seen some people only use flood consistency for this step but I wanted a bit more control because I’m still learning. After they dried overnight I took a portion of my royal icing and added more powdered sugar to make it super stiff and thick. Once I was able to pull the spatula upward to make firm peaks, I decided it was firm enough to pipe fine details. I think I used a small star tip to pipe the roses and pink borders",

m380jkt,t3_1hjo3wa,1hjo3wa,"In case you are curious, I made a video comparing the ingredients, methods and taste. Also asked 8 people (from the restaurant industry) to taste all six breads and pick their favorites. This was a true baking marathon. I wanted all cakes to be made the same day for a fair comparison.

m6epvar,t3_1hjo3wa,1hjo3wa,"Thank you for this. I'm a vegan. I'm also a mom of 2, full time corporate manager, part time fitness instructor, knitter, martial artist, linguaphile.... All that to say, I don't have the amount of time to test, tweak, perfect recipes. I need to be told which one is good. I can't thank you enough for saving me the huge amount of time I don't have. I made the MIDF cake with the PUL frosting based on your other video, and it was a huge hit!!! Importantly, it was served at gym party alongside non-vegan cakes and won over the non-vegans. I try not to be an annoying proselytizing vegan, so I love when we can win over with the carrot rather than the stick. Who knows, maybe one of those non-vegans will open their minds thanks to that recipe??

I love how you present the images and baked goods, it's a really artistic and stylized presentation. I can see your skill with photography creeping in there!

These are such amazingly helpful posts. I appreciate your contribution to the vegan community. Please keep them coming 🙏... I'd put in a vote for vegan red velvet cake if you take requests?

m3gs4l3,t3_1hjo3wa,1hjo3wa,Love the rainbow plant life quick breads! I usually add pecans and walnuts to her banana bread because I like a little crunch.  It’s hard to believe how quickly vegan bakers have been able to make of use of aquafaba considering it was only “invented” like 10 years ago.,
m39o3ke,t1_m38ibkq,1hjo3wa,"I personally really loved Pick Up Limes recipe it's very classic. Rainbow Plant Life banana bread had an amazing texture, moist and soft, it also had the most expressive banana flavor, but it might be because I didn't add any add-ins. Make It Dairy Free, with walnuts and chocolate was also in my top 3. Thanks to Rahi Devlukia, I tried using dates in banana bread fort the first time and loved it. From My Bowl recipe, I think, is amazing for breakfast, with nut butter and oats, it's moist and flavorful. The Edgy Veg has a delicious biscoff crumble, many loved it. With the cookies also in the batter, it tasted more like a delicious spice bread and had less banana flavor.      
The 8 other tasters that I asked all had different opinions, but there where some similarities.",
m39oguf,t1_m38qbze,1hjo3wa,"Oh, sorry to hear that. Fingers crossed, maybe someone here in the community will see this and have the recipe. Where is it from? I'm not familiar with Notjustsoy, was it a website/creator?",

All 6 recipes called for 3 bananas each also two had a banana on top.  I had small ones, so I added a bit more than 3 per recipe. I went with 300g of banana per recipe. Using identical amount of banana allowed for a fair comparison.",
m6lqybv,t1_m6epvar,1hjo3wa,"Thank you for taking the time to write this! It means the world to hear that my posts are helping the community! Also, as someone who loves photography, I really appreciate the compliment. 

I often feel like food speaks louder than my words. I usually don’t tell people (who don’t know I’m vegan) that the food I make is vegan until the end of the meal or tasting. It allows tasters to approach the flavors with an open mind, free of any expectations. 

Every ‘’Really, that was vegan?’’ gives me hope that the question eventually turns into a seed of curiosity. 

Someone recently asked for a video comparing vegan brownie recipes, as it is a relatively simple treat that can be made on weekdays. I think I’ll do that next. Your red velvet suggestion has been pinned to the idea board! Thank you for the links!",

m3zn5u2,t1_m3veqd7,1hmn0c9,"Thanks! We adapted one from vegan cookies invade your cookie jar, I've never really written it out properly though. I'll do my best >\_< The recipe make *a lot* of gingerbread, though we still needed 2x for the carousel + some sugar cookies for contrast.

**Dry Ingredients**

* 750g plain/all purpose flour
* 1.5tsp baking powder
* 0.5tsp baking soda
* 1tsp salt
* Spice blend (4.5tsp ginger; 1.5tsp nutmeg & cinnamon; scant 0.5tsp cloves) ^(we like ours fairly well spiced, scale up/down to taste)

**Wet ingredients**

* 220g buttery nuttelex (Australian spreadable vegan butter, has 65% fat content)
* 245g molasses
* 450g granulated sugar
* 60ml milk + 1 tsp egg replacer powder (we use orgran but bob's red mill or the like would work)

**Method**

1. Melt sugar + molasses + butter over medium heat, the sugar does not need to be completely dissolved.
2. Add milk/egg replacer, whisk to combine.
3. Sift + fold in dry ingredients in thirds to form a stiff, slightly sticky dough.
4. Divide into two parts, wrap in plastic and refrigerate for at least one hour or up to 3 days.
5. Before rolling, preheat oven to 180°C/350°F.
6. Roll dough over baking paper or on a floured surface to about 6mm for structural pieces or 4mm for non-structural.
7. Cut shapes and bake - baking times depend heavily on the size of your shapes, small cutouts may take as little as 8-12 mins but the larger octagons (28cm diameter) we used for the carousel took over 20 minutes to be fully stable.
8. We usually re-cut the shapes once immediately after removing them from the oven to allow for crisp edges.
9. Allow the gingerbread to cool, then decorate and assemble as required.",

lz968od,t1_lz79w3z,1h0kup2,"Sugar isn't for the bread, It's to help activate the yeast. By time you pour the water and yeast in the sugar should already be consumed. Bake often?",
lzalkfg,t1_lz968od,1h0kup2,"Yes, I have baked all my own bread for the past 15 years or so. The yeast does just fine consuming the carbohydrates in the flour, extra sugar is unnecessary. Thanks for the rude and patronising tone though!",

The Pick Up Limes cake had a very good buttercream (with dark chocolate).

The Banana Diaries cake was great too, but it was on the sweeter side. I have made her recipe adding sour cherries between layers and it worked very well.",

Maybe you have a gluten free banana bread recipe in mind, that you would like me to test?",
l9lj08k,t1_krretck,1aimv7k,"I use the ""spin"" technique to reduce doming in round cake recipes. After adding your batter to the prepared pan, tap on the counter a few times to start leveling and pop air bubbles, then put the pan on the counter and use your palms to quickly spin the pan. The centripetal force will subtly push the batter towards the sides of the pan and create a small depression in the center.

kp12r2c,t1_kp0b5zk,1aimv7k,"Yes! Colleen Patrick-Goudreau’s book, “The Joy of Vegan Baking” has incredible recipes. Instead of taking pictures of her cook book, I found this even though it has chocolate chips in it:

kp327us,t1_kp0b5zk,1aimv7k,I can recommend to try at least one recipe which combines bananas with shredded or sliced apples. For example [this one](https://www.veganricha.com/one-bowl-vegan-banana-apple-bread/#recipe).,

m5nd820,t3_1huqnr5,1huqnr5,Looks fab! Tres leches isn’t one I’ve personally tackled before. Do you have a recipe to share?,
m5p9upu,t3_1huqnr5,1huqnr5,"Latina vegan, looks delicious!! You’re very sweet to your partner.

Usually the base of a tres leches cake is not coconut flavor and is a mild/neutral vanilla. 

I’ve made a few variations and the Nora Cooks recipe is good.

What really gets it authentic is sweetened condensed milk flavor, but I haven’t really nailed that yet without buying a specifically vegan version of that product yet.

When you buy these at a Latin bakery they usually put a line of maraschino cherries down the top 😋",😋
m5ppbo2,t3_1huqnr5,1huqnr5,Looks delicious! Saved the recipe! Thank you for sharing.,
m5ndqwk,t3_1huqnr5,1huqnr5,RECIPE PLZ,
m5nvx2e,t3_1huqnr5,1huqnr5,"Looks great! I need to give this a try, I haven’t had tres leches since going vegan",
m5o4ebb,t3_1huqnr5,1huqnr5,"Well done! 
I wish you had a recipe with measurements, and such, however I can relate, as some of my best culinary achievements are done in the go!",
m5pnvga,t3_1huqnr5,1huqnr5,Tres leches is my favorite cake! However I’ve had a hard time with it absorbing. I’ll put in the mixture on and leave overnight and it just sits. I haven’t tried the box cake tho…that might do the trick! I usually use a vegan Victoria cake sponge as the base but the results are very inconsistent for me.,
m5nfw4n,t1_m5nd820,1huqnr5,"Yes! So for the cake I used the Duncan Hines Dolly Parton Coconut cake mix. But in theory you can use any flavor cake. I substituted in coconut milk, Bob’s Red Mill egg replacer, and melted a stick of plant based butter. I then combined the wet ingredients with the dry ones. I baked the cake in a 9x13 pan at 350 for 25 minutes. I then let it cool on the counter for an hour.

For the three milks I combined a cup and a half of coconut milk, a can of coconut sweetened condensed milk, and a cup of plant based heavy cream a long with a dash of vanilla extract. Once I whisked those together I just poured it on top of the cake. To make sure the liquid really absorbed I used a fork to poke holes in the cake. 

For the whipped topping I used plant based heavy cream, a cup of powdered sugar, and a few dashes of vanilla extract and beat those together before spreading on top. You can top the cake with strawberries or cinnamon like I did. And then let it chill in the fridge over night. It’s bomb af I hope you try it",
m5poqdv,t1_m5p9upu,1huqnr5,"once i tried nature's charm sweetened condensed coconut milk and i thought the flavor was disappointing, it was just kind of sugary. sweetened condensed milk has such a strong milky flavor that i'm not sure how it could be replicated. i've been too scared to make a tres leches cake.",
m5pvla2,t1_m5ppbo2,1huqnr5,It’s so good I hope you enjoy,
m5ngmc5,t1_m5ndqwk,1huqnr5,I just posted it! I hope you enjoy,
m5o4iis,t1_m5o4ebb,1huqnr5,I posted the recipe in the comments^^,
m5pwf2w,t1_m5pnvga,1huqnr5,The shitty box mix totally absorbed the milk. But also I poke a bunch of holes in the cake with a fork before pouring all liquid and wait a few minutes before putting on whipped cream,
m5nr2j5,t1_m5nfw4n,1huqnr5,Thank you for sharing this !!!!,
m5ninta,t1_m5nfw4n,1huqnr5,"Which plant based heavy cream did you use? I’ve used the Silk product, but during the holidays, I saw that Califia Farms has one, but I haven’t tried it yet.",
m5r0d9v,t1_m5nfw4n,1huqnr5,thank you for sharing the recipe.,
m5pqxdl,t1_m5poqdv,1huqnr5,So the brand that I used is called Andre Prost. It was the only coconut condensed milk available at my local Walmart in the baking isle. The flavor was pretty spot on,

m5nqr9y,t1_m5ninta,1huqnr5,I used the country crock one and I really like it. Trader Joe’s has a pretty good one too,

m7o74ju,t1_m7n41b9,1i2tbm4,"Of cource! heres my recipe:

Pie Crust(fits a 9.5 inch pie crust):
4 ingredients

140 g Water

280 g All purpose flour(I use pilsberry)

0.5 tsp salt

5.5 tbsp olive oil(I use Extra virgin)

Directions
Step 1
In a medium bowl, stir the flour, salt and oil until all flour is moistened. Next, add the water stiring with a fork until absorbed. 
Step 2
Gather the pastry into a ball, if the ball is falling apart add more flour. If its sticking to your hands/looks to wet add more flour.

Step 3

Lightly flour a surfance. Flour your roller as well. Roll out your dough by first rolling up then down to start. It may try to shrink back up, but it will stop as you roll it out. Rotate rolling pin to the right 45 degrees starting in the middle rolling out. Then 90 degrees, then roll down. Then 45 degrees on the other side then 90 degrees then 45 degrees. Rinse and repeat until the crust is about a quarter coin thick.

Step 4

Place your desired pie pan with the inside facing down in the middle of the rolled out dough to make sure it will fit, if it dosents you can cut excess from other areas and use some water to recombine the cuts back into the pie crust. Simply rub water onto the cut edge then press it into the desired edge then roll it until its combines again. Should work great.

Step 5
 
GENTLY pull pie crust off your surfance(if it tears, just roll back into a ball and reroll it out again) and put it into your pie pan

You won't really be able to taste any nutty flavors. Though I didn't really use the strong extra Virgin Olive oil I did get a buttery flavor from the crust, it's a fairly strong crust and was able to withstand a very large pumpkin pie.

Hope you enjoy! Let me know how it goes, please!!!

 Pie Crust: Fill and bake as directed in the pie recipe. 

Baked Pie Crust: Heat the oven to 475°F. Prick the bottom and side of the crust thoroughly with a fork, bttom and sides. Bake 10 to 12 minutes or the rim is light brown. Cool completely on a cooling rack, about 2 hours, you can also wait overnight if you want to make sure that it's completely cool. Fill as directed in the pie recipe.",

I added about 1 tsp of almond extract as well. 

For the mascarpone, it was a home developed recipe…here are the ingredients and quantities: 

Firm tofu - 220g

Silkentefe-220g

soy yogurt - 220g

Tapioaca starch- 3 tbsp (add more if not thick after cooling in fridge)

ACV - 1 tsp

sugar - 100g

Vanilla - 1-2 tbsp

Salt- 1 tsp

Vegan butter - 1/2 cup


Blend everything together then place in a container. Cool in fridge until very cold. It should hold its shape when scooped out with spoon! 



Assembly: 

Dust bottom with coco powder, add a cake layer (I trimmed mine to expose the crumb), brush on about 1 espresso shot, add half of the mascorpone filling, and repeat. Finally dust with more coco powder and chill from a minimum of 4 hours. I chilled mine for 24 hours to let everything get absorbed!",

kxhui5p,t1_kxhpkh8,1bsrxxh,"Thank you! I used Tofutti cream cheese. It’s the only brand I’ve ever used so I’m not sure how it compares to others, but so far it has worked well for everything! 

The minimalist frosting was a last second choice because I was afraid the frosting would be too rich, but it definitely could have used more! I do like the way it looks though, so I think next time I would just add more frosting to the middle and top of the cake. Also, for the carrot and border, I had to add a lot more confectioners sugar to make it stable enough to pipe and hold shape. 

As for storage—I stored it overnight (about 7 hours) in the freezer after layering and frosting and added the carrot and border this morning while it was still cold. I brought it to a family gathering where it sat in a pretty warm kitchen for about 2 hours before serving and it all held up very well.


Definitely add this to your list! I am still getting text messages from my family (all non-vegans) saying it was the best carrot cake they’ve ever had!",
kxm8a3t,t1_kxl6mli,1bsrxxh,"Hi! So, I’m not a professional by any means, so I’m sure this isn’t the right way, but I always do a crumb coat first, freeze or chill in the fridge (buttercream firms up a lot quicker than this cream cheese frosting so I usually just use the refrigerator for that), then while the cake is still very cold, I do my final layer of frosting and use a metal bench scraper to go along the sides and the top several times. 

When it’s almost to a point that I’m happy with, I take a small offset spatula and carefully smooth out the edges. 

For buttercream that is really frozen, I will dip the scraper in hot water, dry it off, and do the same and it works very well!",
kxla204,t1_kxi2b89,1bsrxxh,"Out of curiosity, did you squeeze every possible drip of carrot liquid out of the carrots before mixing into the batter? 

My husband’s favorite cake is carrot cake, but he cannot have dairy so I was on a quest for the perfect carrot cake recipe. Fail after fail, I finally found one recipe that said to squeeze all of the liquid from the carrots. 
PERFECTION! 

I used Nora’s recipe last year and added the step of squeezing the carrot juice & same, perfect results! I’ll never turn back, even if a recipe doesn’t call for it. ",
kxunqw9,t1_kxuhz7w,1bsrxxh,"Hi! Yes I used applesauce! I followed this one *almost* exactly to the letter. I did use soy milk instead of almond milk, vegetable oil instead of canola oil, and I believe I was about 20 grams short on the carrots, but I went for it anyway lol. 

I did look up the “proper” way to grate and prep the carrots. I was so worried that there would be too much moisture from the carrots as she didn’t mention anything about patting them dry or anything, but from what I gathered, the moisture from the carrots is an important part so I just grated them and left them alone!

Can I ask what went wrong? I’m not an expert baker by any means, but I am an avid troubleshooter haha.",

kxla80p,t1_kxla204,1bsrxxh,I didn’t squeeze any out! Maybe that was my issue. I can’t even recall if the recipe told me to but I was multitasking so I could have overlooked that.,
kxv8dow,t1_kxunqw9,1bsrxxh,"So I used a pineapple puree instead of the apple sauce, oat milk instead of almond. It deflated quite a bit when removing from the oven, more so than other cakes I've baked. And it was also pretty dense and 'gummy', I think it was cooked though as it was in there for 45 minutes. Some people complained of it being too moist, so maybe that was the issue?

And yeah saw about the carrots, I've never strained carrots for carrot cake before *but* I also saw some comments saying that when grating them in a food processor they may retain more water.

**To try next time:**

- wring carrots to remove excess moisture (I do not have a manual grater, just the ones that comes with the food processor)

- bake it proper oven and not air fryer (my air fryer has a bake function which I've used several times but never for cakes, only croissants, cookies etc)

Let me know if you have any other suggestions!",

m4nv4is,t3_1hp8srj,1hp8srj,Thank you for sharing! Gave her a fallow on IG. Her recipes look incredible!,
m5h5u31,t3_1hp8srj,1hp8srj,Could you provide the temperature for baking and how many minutes it took ? Convection or conventional Oven or air fryer  ?,
m6e5ys7,t3_1hp8srj,1hp8srj,"I’m a vegan baker -  7hrs is too long to proof. 
I don’t know her recipe or process you paid for but the guy who has the best (and free) YouTube videos to learn the process is Jimmy Griffin, master baker. I took his croissant recipe and ditched the small amount of milk powder (more water) and used the vegan block Naturli for the butter.
I watched a lot of his videos. He has excellent books published if you want to expand your skills. Highly recommend this guy and also old man te for more scientific breakdown. I make at home and sell. ",
m4g7elf,t1_m4g2afp,1hp8srj,"I would! I got the croissants + viennoiserie bundle because I want to make almond croissants, pains aux raisins, cruffins, etc. eventually. 

The course includes helpful videos that clearly show each step, and you’re supposed to be able to message Clarisse with questions, although I haven’t tried that yet. 

The recipe was different from free ones I’ve found online, like the one I used for my first attempt. These worked much better. 

I was spurred into this journey by the lack of vegan croissants available near me (and I’m in the NYC area!). There was a French bakery in my neighborhood that had them, but they went downhill in quality and now they don’t sell them anymore. Even the frozen bake-at-home ones at Whole Foods have disappeared. 

This past summer I went to Saint Jean in Amsterdam and the pastries they have are unbelievable. I’m just a home baker with no professional equipment, so I can’t hope to replicate what they do but I want to at least get something decent for my pastry fix.",
m4gey31,t1_m4gb02x,1hp8srj,"Honestly my cross-section wasn’t perfect because I messed up in the lamination step, as mentioned in my post. I had airy holes but not that classic honeycomb structure. I recommend checking out her instagram for lots of pictures, including some from people who took the course (check the “croissants” highlight reel). Hopefully I’ll get it closer to right next time.",
m4jy9jv,t1_m4hhsp9,1hp8srj,"I’ll keep that in mind, thanks! I froze the other half of this batch after shaping so I’m planning to thaw them in the fridge the day before baking and proof overnight.",
m4gf9q0,t1_m4gb3hx,1hp8srj,"I used instant! And it really puffed up when resting in the fridge so I thought I would have no issues proofing. I should have proofed them in the oven with a pan of hot water from the start, but after my previous experience I was terrified of the butter melting.",
m4g9rod,t1_m4g7elf,1hp8srj,"Oh amazing! Thanks for all the info!! Wild you can't find a vegan croissant in NYC of all places 😵‍💫

I'm in Halifax Nova Scotia, we have a decent vegan croissant option locally actually! 

I bake for a living and would LOVE to offer traditional pastry but I have no training in that so this could be a great first step into professional development.",😵💫
m4nin4f,t1_m4g7elf,1hp8srj,Wow this resonates so much for me! Pastries are the thing I miss most and the thing I actively seek out when I travel to bigger cities. I had never considered taking a course in making them - I always just felt daunted by the idea of trying to do it from a free online recipe. Thanks for the resource!,
m4jnj0w,t1_m4gf9q0,1hp8srj,You kept the frozen rolled Crossaint in the fridge and let it overnight ? How much time it took for proof,

It’s simple, but I think you’ll enjoy it (and it’s basic enough that you can tweak it until you get your desired end result).

lo12kwe,t1_lo0dz9h,1fkhrgk,Awesome!!!  I will definitely try this recipe 😊,😊
lo0capw,t1_lnyu15s,1fkhrgk,"I understand!  What I usually do is I put two scoops of dough, for “test cookies,” in the freezer. I will clean up any baking-related messes and, then, I bake off those two cookies that got a little micro-chill, so to speak. That enables me to, potentially, enjoy two [giant] cookies. I usually start by lying to myself and saying something like, “I’ll just have a quarter of one.”  Regardless, that leaves the second cookie available for me to eat at a later time that night— when I will, most likely, run downstairs, for more, like the little goblin that I am. Or, I can scarf it down, in the morning.. as part of a “complete” breakfast, of course. 

The key is to make them right before bed. That way, you get your warm-cookie night cap.  Then, you can let the dough, that you didn’t bake off, get a several-hour chill, while you sleep. 

This is, pretty much, the only way I’m capable of chilling the dough for longer periods of time. I need to have at least a couple of cookies available for immediate consumption!  Anyway, this “method” could work for you, too :)",
lnyi6zh,t1_lnyf0so,1fkhrgk,"For sure. And, thank you!  :). And, I don’t want to interfere with your tried and true CC Cookie recipe.. but, yeah, taking a crack at this one probably couldn’t hurt!",
