Your complaining sounds similar to someone being educated on why to not buy fast fashion for the first time. Factory farms are unethical for multiple reasons just as sweatshops in asia where people work in inhumane conditions is unethical. People are simply unaware of how much something should cost when its produced more ethically.  People used to spend a higher percentage of income on both food and clothing because people purchased better quality food and clothing. America has some of the lowest food prices in the world comparatively as well. Need to wake up and understand why super cheap stuff is not sustainable or ethical. People are too effing detached from how the things they purchase are made and its sad. Need to stop normalizing buying a shirt for $10-20, or eggs for 25 cents. The only reason why animal products in grocery stores are as cheap as they are anyways is because our govt hugely subsidizes them.",

I live in Germany.  
Following are the price from the big supermarket chain today for each type of eggs (based on how their barn is):  

Bodenhaltung (fully barn) : 1,99€ / 10 eggs  

Freilandhaltung (free range) : 2,29€ / 10 eggs  

Bio (organic) : 3,89€ / 10 eggs

I do completely understand your point, and that having to unlearn and relearn “cooking” takes time and awareness and a willingness to learn, but at some point you cant afford to give every excuse in the book to people when we live in a world where so much information is accessible.

What I take issue with, however, is you spewing vague generalized statements like, “for some ppl meat and eggs are necessary bc of GI disorders” without specificity regarding which disorders you are referring to. What I also find problematic is your generalized statement inferring that some people need meat and eggs to survive, which, again, I am casting into doubt without more information from you. I myself have type 2 DM and gerd and have thrived on a vegan diet. I am aware of severe and rare allergy cases interfering with being able to sustain a vegan diet without proper access to nutrition education and sufficient groceries.

""there is no ethical consumption under capitalism"" is a terrible argument to do anything. just because all consumption involves exploitation, does this mean it's fruitless to refuse the absolute worst, most unethical types of consumption? this is a way to absolve yourself of responsibility for what you pay for. companies only do unethical things because a happy consumer buys it at the end of the line.

suppose a company produced a product that you liked a lot, & you did not need this product. if the company told you, ""with every 10 purchases, we kill a child!"" would you say ""well, no ethical consumption under capitalism"" and buy it anyways? that would be bizarre. perhaps no consumption is 100% ethical, but this doesn't mean that we shouldn't refuse to participate in the consumption that is 0% ethical.",
m1s3kmq,t1_m1s2amn,1hcu85c,"I've found the opposite.  

Every time Ive had a craving for a veganized version of an beloved recipe, I've had success from a serious blog or excellent book.  

The only notable trial and error, many multiples of recipes because I'm stupid picky about the Betty Crocker Cookie Book recipe taste and texture, was snickerdoodles.",
m1spkoi,t1_m1sl56p,1hcu85c,"How is the OP being annoying? They just stated a fact. They also did not repost the picture; they reposted the reddit thread. Because it was the comments they were talking about, not the photo. 

I never said we are the only mammals to eat eggs, I said one of the. Because statistically, very few species do.

Also, I didn't realize I had to clarify with milk that I wasn't talking about when they are 6 week old infants unable to see and hear. As adults, we are the only species to do so. In fact, the reason why so many people are lactose intolerant is because we are not made to drink milk after infancy. When animals stop breastfeeding, they lose the ability to fully digest lactose, as they no longer need it. The only reason this doesn't always happen to humans is because you only stop being able to digest lactose when you stop drinking it. If you continue to drink milk, you will continue to be able to digest it. Because to your body, it is still being breastfed, so it still needs to be able to digest lactose. 

I never claimed you said people should only eat eggs and milk. I said that there are not GI issues where that is all you can eat. Implying you can also eat other foods, so it is still possible to be vegan (but maybe more difficult). 

Again, I never claimed animal products are part of all of your meals. 

Also, no, you do not need meat to sustain and heal yourself. It may be easier, but clearly, it is not the only way.

And it seems you missed my point bringing up eating humans. No matter how much someone says it is best for their health, it is immoral. A large portion of vegans believe it is immoral to eat any species that is conscious and capable of feeling and expressing pain. And hopefully, someday, more people will recognize this. Potentially, even laws will follow. After all, cannibalism used to be common among humans.",
m1trevx,t1_m1t7q2r,1hcu85c,"im not denying people recovery, whatever that means. i am, in fact, recovering. mental illness isnt an excuse to actively contribute to the murder and torture of animals. animal exploitation is wrong and unnecessary. the animals are not here to make you feel better, their life is not ours to use. animals are not here for human benefit.",
m2ff0x9,t1_m1ztrzt,1hcu85c,"You don't care about the class of the other person doing it but ""if there is another option available and they're not taking it, they're unethical."" 

What if I told you that the reason pesticide holders have to be designed for children to hold is because this country uses child labor in picking your organic vegan salad. That when people designed it only for adults, children routinely were disfiguring themselves with pesticides and industrial chemicals because they were the ones out there, with their families, picking and growing your produce. 

Would you eat the salad?? 

But that's all you have to eat! You're disabled or Autistic! You struggle to even eat that! This is what you can AFFORD to eat. It what you know how to cook. 

But isn't it unethical for you to go forth eating produce in America knowing how we treat migrant farm workers and how they're exposed to horrific working conditions and that whole families work in the fields because they can't afford child care??? 

It's almost as if you would do the best you can under the conditions you can. 

It's almost as if you, or ANYONE does what they can as they can, and calling a poor person who can't afford to go Vegan, amoral is a ridiculously classist, racist, shitty stance that doesn't understand how race, class, and culture come into play with food.",

m1syxuq,t1_m1spkoi,1hcu85c,"That’s not why people are lactose intolerant. 

and yes, I do need to eat meat for my health because I have food allergies and I have a literal eating disorder. I have been told to do so by multiple different doctors and a nutritionist. you are not my doctor or my nutritionist so I don’t need you to tell me what I should and should not eat. You do not know my medical history so therefore you have no say. it’s quite disrespectful, inappropriate, and offensive that you think you can tell me what I should and shouldn’t eat. you have no idea how mine or anyone else’s body works. only your own. 

I’m glad that you have found something that works for you but trying to push that on to other people is really not ok. Kinda like how I’m not pushing what I’m doing with my health onto you, because I know it’s disrespectful and wrong.",
m1vm49d,t1_m1trevx,1hcu85c,"It’s very obvious that you think that you’re better than people because you were able to be vegan and recover, that’s not the case for everyone.

m2tehex,t1_m2ff0x9,1hcu85c,"i have to eat something. eating plants is the most ethical thing. you do understand that animals eat plants too, right? so eating animals is objectively more unethical, because you'd  be paying for the child worker abuse, plus the torture of the animal.

you're trying to muddy the waters and say that everything is equally unethical. two things being unethical does not mean they are equally unethical. eating plants is much much more ethical than eating animals. moreover, due to the fact that we have to eat something, i do have to select the most ethical source of food available. what you're arguing for is to not have to be ethical in food choices.

poor people can afford to be vegan. the cheapest foods are vegan. it is an invented idea that being vegan is expensive.",
m1sl74v,t1_m1s7xd4,1hcu85c,"Why thanks, your anecdotes sound like you finally found your way, too!  It's alright to meander!",
m1tyt60,t1_m1syxuq,1hcu85c,"That simply is why people are lactose intolerant. There is more science behind it, but from an evolutionary standard, that is true. 

Also, I never claimed you should stop eating meat, and I'm sorry if that is how it sounded. I simply wanted to explain that, truly, people in general can get enough nutrients off of non-animal products to survive, even with allergies. Otherwise, how would the animals they eat have the needed nutrients? Veganism is possible but might not be an option for people. For example, a lot of grocery stores do not sell certain foods that can make being vegan an option. Like nutritional yeast is not always sold, but is such an easy way to get needed vitamins. Being vegan is not hard, but being vegan in the world we live in, which is already so pro meat, is. 

I do believe it is immoral to eat animals, but I also believe society pushes it upon people. Just like how I believe it is immoral to fly on airplanes as often as I do to visit family. While that aspect of me is immoral, I feel I do enough good to outweigh it. (Like fostering and volunteering for animal rescues). So, just a little context here that I believe you can do immoral things and still be a very moral person, and there are just necessary evils sometimes. For you, that might be eating meat. 

I believe a large difference here is I am talking more from the stance of it is possible, whereas you are talking more from your experience, in which it may not be a good option. 

Also, I wish you the best of luck with overcoming your eating disorder. I've been there too, and it really sucks.",
m1vnh3b,t1_m1tyt60,1hcu85c,"there are plenty of people that cannot get enough nutrients solely from plants because their body cannot absorb it properly since they have gastrointestinal disorders. I really don’t know why I have to keep saying this or why you choose to be uneducated about this. 

I genuinely don’t know why there are so many vegans that feel so entitled to telling other people what they should and shouldn’t eat. y’all freak out when someone who eats meat makes fun of you for being vegan or tries to convince u to eat meat or whatever else, but the moment it’s flipped it’s fine. It’s very hypocritical. there has not been a single time that I have sat here and I’ve tried to tell you that you should eat meat because that’s not my place but there have been multiple times that multiple people have told me that I should be vegan because I’m a bad person for eating meat

it is not immoral for me to be healthy, but if that’s what you think then that’s pretty ableist. 

like it’s hilarious that you’re literally saying veganism might not be an option for everyone yet in the same comment, you’re still condemning people for not being vegan like you’re just not making any sense. 

and no, I’m not talking solely from my experience. I’m talking from the experience of people that have told me and that I have viewed with my own eyes. Like I don’t know why you think this is fake. That’s genuinely weird. People are allowed to eat meat and still be good people and I don’t know how to change your mind but I quite honestly don’t fucking care. If you want to think people who eat meat are bad people that’s fine, but I think people who judge other people for what they eat are the real bad people.

I will be blocking from here on out because this should not go on for days and it’s also super disappointing to have to leave a community where I was getting recipes from to help me bake because I’m lactose intolerant. Like it’s genuinely sad the hatred some of you guys hold, but it’s not something that I’m willing to be a part of.",

leaq7ao,t1_leaij8o,1dip47t,"Thank you so much! I’m not a professional but I’m actually in the process of putting together a portfolio so I can try working at a bakery

As for the batter, I generally fill pans 1/2 or 3/4 of the way up. To make the layers perfectly even, I use my digital kitchen scale to weigh each pan. I’ll scoop a little out of one and put it in another in order to get them as close in weight as possible

For the frosting, it’s really a preference thing I think. I just kind of plop on enough so that it looks proportionate to me (cake layer thickness to frosting thickness). I know some people like to pipe their frosting onto and inside of the cake, that seems to help make it all a uniform thickness but I just wing it

The vast majority of my cake recipes are from Gretchen’s Vegan Bakery [on YouTube](https://youtube.com/@gretchensveganbakery?si=6yURcaSmv96rxYea).

Starting a tutorial channel is one of my goals! I’m so BAD with videos and editing though rofl. I’m slowly learning how to do all the technical stuff, and do plan to start posting my vegan cooking and baking tutorials down the line! 

Heehe the naked cake! I’m sure it still tasted divine! ❤️",💕❤

m2nd2k1,t1_m2jwydk,1hgbivm,"Sure thing! ❤️

250g salted European style butter, 250g unsalted European style butter, 1-2 tbsp vanilla bean paste or vanilla extract, 1-2 tbsp creamy plant milk (go for oat, soy or cashew if you can), and 6-8 cups of powdered sugar. 

Using the paddle attachment for your mixer, cream your softened butter. Then add your vanilla. Add your powdered sugar one cup at a time, mixing well between each addition and scraping the sides and bottom of the bowl to prevent unmixed clumps. Add in your milk if you wish. 

The type of butter is the key ingredient here. If you can find Violife salted & unsalted butter, you’re golden. I find that no other vegan butter works nearly as well. The oils in other brands make them unable to hold their shape when decorating and also lend a more greasy/salty flavor. I think I’ve heard some good comments about Miyokos being a good alternative, but I’ve never personally tried making buttercream with it yet. 

I hope this helps! Happy baking love ❤️ ✨😊",❤❤✨😊

m2nbpps,t1_m2kg2do,1hgbivm,"Sure! ❤️

I use: 250g unsalted European style vegan butter, 250g salted European style vegan butter, 1-2 tablespoons of vanilla bean paste or vanilla extract, 1-2 tbsp of a creamy plant milk of your choice (I prefer oat, soy or cashew), and anywhere from 6-8 cups of powdered sugar. The butter is the most important party here. Things like Earth Balance etc will not work well or taste good. If you can, get your hands on Violife butter or I’ve also heard good things about Miyoko’s. 

Cream your softened butter first, then add in your vanilla bean paste and 1 cup of powdered sugar at a time, beating well between each addition and making sure to scrape down the sides and bottom of the bowl. Add in your milk if you wish and mix well, this is optional though!

Use a paddle attachment on your mixer and not the whisk - I find the whisk creates tons of air bubbles which make for less smooth decoration and more need for patch fixing.

m2rniec,t1_m2rkz1m,1hgbivm,"That happened to me with this order actually haha. For the chocolate cupcakes, I had to make the chocolate espresso buttercream using only salted butter and it turned out great, not salty at all. So you could easily get away with making a flavored buttercream and be fine. It may be more noticeable with a straight up vanilla, but it really depends on the salt content in the butter. Some brands contain more than others. 

Hmm. I have also heard good things about Miyoko's butter (it comes in both unsalted and salted as well) and Trader Joe's apparently has a European style butter too that's worth trying.",

I now use ground flax and warm water as replacer for all my baking recipes. I use 1tbsp of flax and 3tbsp of water and heat it up for at least 30 seconds and have it sit in the microwave until it kind of congeals together.

Combine 250g butter, 225g sugar, 2 tsp vanilla, 1tbsp syrup of your choice (agave, corn, golden, treacle but will make a darker cookie, etc) and cream them together til fluffy. Then add 300g flour, 1tsp baking powder, 1 tsp salt and mix til combined. Lastly add chocolate, i think chopped chocolate works best. minimum 100g but i usually add 200g so they’re extra chocolaty 😂

Lastly cook in batches at 180°c, for about 12-16 mins depending on your oven, cookie size and how cooked you like them, this part is kind of trial and error and once you find which works for your tastes you can just do that for future.

lbfrzi9,t3_1dudfzd,1dudfzd,"I'd use Violife/Flora butter instead. The composition is closer to cow's milk butter w/r to the %water and the fats. It stiffens better and stays that way. I only use earth balance for baking where it's going to melt into a recipe like cookies.

Also, you can always add more 10x or less liquid.  Frosting and even more technical buttercreams formulas are  a guide but may not be perfect for you depending on ingredients and your environment. As you make frosting, it's okay to stop when you get to the consistency you want. Humidity plays a role as well so if you're somewhere with a lot of moisture in the air, keep an eye on things and adjust as needed. And! Don't overmix, which can melt the butter. If that happens you can always pop in the fridge and start again. All this to say: different butter, add ingredients slowly and use recipes as a guide, not a hard and fast in this case. 🎂",🎂
lbfsfj2,t3_1dudfzd,1dudfzd,"I am forever an advocate for ermine frosting. It's so customizable. You make it by cooking flour, sugar, and milk into a pudding, which you then chill and whip into (whipped) butter. To make it extra thick, add extra flour and cook it a bit longer (though you have to whisk and scrape like mad to avoid burning). I like using canned coconut milk for the richness (IMO you can't taste the coconut), but I've also used soy milk, oat milk, pureed strawberry, and fresh squeezed orange juice with success. The only time I've had it melt on me was when I put the cake on the floor of a hot car - should've put a towel down. Otherwise I've never had a problem with it holding up.

My favorite thing about ermine is that it gets its structure from the flour, so you can add as much or as little sugar as you want. I get a lot of compliments on how ""adult"" (i.e., not too sweet) my cakes are.

A couple tips on vegan frosting that apply no matter which method you use:

1. Make sure you're using stick butter, not the spreadable kind in tubs.
2. Vegan butter has a higher water content than dairy butter. To counteract this, use a 50/50 blend of vegan butter and shortening (Crisco) which has less water than dairy butter. That should help with the structure.",
lbheky9,t3_1dudfzd,1dudfzd,"I don’t think anyone has mentioned it but Miyoko’s butter is super firm and makes the absolute best vegan icing ever!! Sometimes I do half and half Miyoko’s butter and oatly cream cheese, plus obviously powdered sugar and a little vanilla extract, maybe a touch of soy milk, but I usually do that last bc sometimes it really doesn’t need it!",
lbhfwbj,t3_1dudfzd,1dudfzd,"I’ve run a vegan bakery for the last 5 years and I specialize in cakes. I always make traditional American buttercream with country crock brand non-dairy butter STICKS (not the tubs - too much water). I’ve never had to use shortening to stiffen, if everything is chilled and prepared at the right temperature it won’t fall apart. My buttercream ratio is 1 cup of powdered sugar for every stick of butter (1/2 cup of butter) and I beat the butter at room temperature for 15-20 minutes until it’s fluffy before I start adding in the powdered sugar one cup at a time. I will then continue to beat it with the paddle attachment until it’s smooth and has no air bubbles, 10-15 minutes or so, before adding in vanilla, etc. It’s solid at room temperature and best chilled, it won’t fall apart or collapse unless it gets warm. If it gets too warm I just chill it in the fridge for a half hour or so before beating it lightly again to soften it. Good luck!",

This only makes 10 cookies so if you need a large batch just increase the amount by however many cookies you want to make. (If you are interested just let me know the number you want to make and I'd be happy to do the conversion for you.)

Peanut Butter Cookies:

Ingredients:

1/2 cup creamy peanut butter 
3/4 tsp baking powder
3 tbsp flour
1/3 cup + 1 tbsp cane sugar
2 tbsp unsweetened applesauce
1/2 tsp pure vanilla extract 

Instructions:

1. Combine baking powder, flour, and sugar in a mixing bowl. 
2. Add peanut butter, applesauce, and vanilla to the mixture. 
3. Stir well until a dough is formed. 
4. Form around 10 dough balls (or however many you need if making a larger batch); cover and refrigerate for 1 hr. 
5. Preheat oven to 375F; line a baking sheet with Parchment paper. 
6. Arrange dough balls and gently press down with a fork to form a crisscross shape. (I don't usually have issues with the fork sticking, but if you do dip it in some flour or lightly wetting the fork can also help) 
7. Bake in the oven for 8-10 minutes. 
8. Let the cookies cool for 10 min on the baking sheet before removing them (they may look a little underdone when removed from the oven, this is normal as the cookies will harden on the baking sheet - trust me)

I wonder if that'd be doable with his recipe.

Also, for the step when you cut the dough in triangles, it says to use half the dough.  Considering that the double turn yields a 9"" x 6"" rectangle, I guess you cut it into a 4.5 x 6"" rectangle which you then roll into an 18"" x 20"" rectangle. Is that correct?",

After they are frozen, I would put them in a bag. When you want to bake them just let them defrost and rise as normal (that would take longer). I thought of doing this myself it's a great idea :)) 

About cutting up the dough in half: I was also confused by that, because in the blog post she says to work with half the dough, but then in the recipe card she doesn't say anything. So what I've done is I just rolled out the whole dough and followed her instructions. I cut 10 triangles with no problems.",

🍳1 Vegan Pie Crust*
🍳1 pound sweet potatoes (about 2 medium)
🍳3/4 cup full fat coconut milk
🍳1 cup brown sugar
🍳1 teaspoon bourbon vanilla paste
🍳1 teaspoon pumpkin pie spice
🍳1/4 teaspoon salt
🍳4 tablespoons cornstarch*



Instructions 
🍳Pre-cook a vegan pie crust in a glass dish forking it so it doesn't buckle
🍳Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F. Peel and chop the sweet potatoes, then place them in a medium saucepan and add enough water to cover. This is better than the boil whole than put in cold water because I found it doesn't cook them as well and you'll have to blend it in a blender
🍳Bring to a boil, then reduce the heat and simmer for 12-15 minutes until fork tender. Drain the potatoes and add them to a large bowl 
🍳With a mixer or fork beat the potatoes until smooth, then add all the remaining ingredients (except the whipped cream!) and beat on high speed until smooth and combined.
Spread the sweet potato filling into the pie crust evenly, place vegan alphabet cookies and bake for 55-60 minutes, until the center is only slightly jiggly. 

🍳If the crust begins to burn or brown too much, use a pie shield or cover the edges with aluminum foil for the last half of baking.
ADD VEGAN MARSHMALLOWS AT THE END OR THEYLL ABSORB INTO YOUR PIE LIKE MANY PREGNANCIES. 
🍳You can use a torch lighter to brown the marshmallows OR untent the pie and let the pie brown for a few minutes. 

Adapted from Nora Cooks.

lzqyb9v,t1_lzjekb5,1h2au0b,Abortion should be a right that can’t be taken away. Abortions can be literally life saving. Women and trans people get demonized for choosing what’s best for themselves. No form of government should have any say with what we do with our own bodies. Your rights your freedoms are something you should celebrate and fight for.,

lzkntia,t1_lzjp3j5,1h2au0b,I think getting pregnant in one of those states that doesn't give a shit about women's rights is insane. doctors are too afraid of being convicted of felonies to do anything but wait until the very last moment so they can literally prove in court that the woman would have died without the abortion so what ends up happening that the woman actually freaking dies before getting the abortion in certain cases and that's always a good sign of where humanity's heading. reminder to women who want to be mommies that this is the kind of world that you'll be bringing your spawn into and that reflects on you too.,
lzkehwj,t1_lzjj4dg,1h2au0b,"But only 1 - 3% of abortions are performed for medical reasons, the vast majority are purely elective. That's why it comes across as celebratory and kind of weird and sadistic to put on a Thanksgiving pie. I'm pro choice but I'm certainly not going to celebrate it.",

lzko0u8,t1_lzkehwj,1h2au0b,honestly like we're at a point where abortions are the way to freaking go. adding more people like you in the world is far more harmful  than having an abortion. which is relatively safe. women are not incubators and I think the fact that some people do actually see them as incubators just fucking terrifying and just leaves me in  disbelief.,

Fetuses do not feel pain. **What’s sadistic about not letting a child be born into a world where its mother couldn’t care for it properly?** The mother receiving the abortion is doing what’s best for herself and that fetus.

The more we show acceptance for all abortions, the less shame women who are doing the right thing will feel. This is normalizing something that is trying to be taken away for us. 

I’m grateful for this poster sharing their advocation for human rights.

But regardless of pain it still means that a tiny living being has to die, to pay for this right to choose anything we want. Now I have already said I am pro choice because I believe that people who need it and choose it should have access. But let's not deny the dark side of what the decision entails and pretend it is all happy sunshine and rainbows, make cakes about it and celebrate like it's not.. what it is. There is a scale of suffering and to prevent greater suffering maybe sometimes abortion is better. But it still entails death.",
lzqgdsc,t1_lzmfuaj,1h2au0b,"It’s really not reasonable though. She’s shaming women who have elective abortions, when there’s nothing shameful or “sadistic” about the process. This pie isn’t saying “hooray abortions!” It’s simply advocating for human rights.

lzrtwly,t1_lzra6et,1h2au0b,"“Let’s not deny” show me evidence that any real suffering is caused by abortions and I won’t deny anything. Until then, your scale of “suffering” is based off of nothing but opinion.

“The science conclusively establishes that a human fetus does not have the capacity to experience pain until after at least 24–25 weeks. Every major medical organization that has examined this issue and peer-reviewed studies on the matter have consistently reached the conclusion that abortion before this point does not result in the perception of pain in a fetus”

This is from [American college of obstetricians and gynecologists](https://www.acog.org/advocacy/facts-are-important/gestational-development-capacity-for-pain). And don’t even bring up fetal movement in response to stimuli, the article I’ve linked explains why that’s not indicative of pain.

Over half of all abortions in US are chemical, meaning they have to be before 15 weeks. It’s not cruel, it’s not sadistic, and it’s not death when it can’t live outside its mother yet. Your rhetoric is the same as those who are anti-choice. While I’m hopeful you vote in a way that supports choice, I disagree with your thoughts on the fetus’s “suffering”",

Here’s a hypothetical:

The human body naturally miscarries without the person knowing they’re pregnant, and the person just thinks they got their period. In this scenario no one knew of the pregnancy, even the pregnant person. 

Do you believe that the 3 week old fetus suffered, something with no consciousness and no pain receptors? What’s your reasoning besides your beliefs? Because to me the fetus basically didn’t exist since no one knew.",
lzw16sj,t1_lzu1jaa,1h2au0b,"“Basically” ever heard of logical fallacies, because that’s not what I’m arguing at all.

It’s the circle of life. Things die, by accident, by nature, by human interference in this case. Sometimes it’s sad, sometimes it’s something that just happens. It’s only so sad to you because of your BELIEFS and I have my own here so why don’t we respect each other and end the argument here.

But of course I agree, it’s sad for women who wanted their baby and wanted to be mothers. But I don’t agree that every abortion is a sad thing, miscarriages happen without women even noticing they were pregnant and no one’s sad over it.",

I added about 1 tsp of almond extract as well. 

For the mascarpone, it was a home developed recipe…here are the ingredients and quantities: 

Firm tofu - 220g

Silkentefe-220g

soy yogurt - 220g

Tapioaca starch- 3 tbsp (add more if not thick after cooling in fridge)

ACV - 1 tsp

sugar - 100g

Vanilla - 1-2 tbsp

Salt- 1 tsp

Vegan butter - 1/2 cup


Blend everything together then place in a container. Cool in fridge until very cold. It should hold its shape when scooped out with spoon! 



Assembly: 

Dust bottom with coco powder, add a cake layer (I trimmed mine to expose the crumb), brush on about 1 espresso shot, add half of the mascorpone filling, and repeat. Finally dust with more coco powder and chill from a minimum of 4 hours. I chilled mine for 24 hours to let everything get absorbed!",

And are you measuring your flour properly (weighing or using scoop and level method)? I’ve followed a lot of Sam Turnbull’s recipes and almost all of them turn out well. For this particular recipe I’d guess that you using oat flour made it not come together and the added applesauce caused a problem. It could also be a problem with your oven temperature. It’s very strange that this would be happening with every single recipe you try 🤔 Buy an oven thermometer (they run $5-$10 for price).

Edit: I see that this particular recipe calls for cold butter so disregard my comment on the room temp ingredients in this case. I’m wondering if you used a harder vegan butter like the kind of butter you’d find in a stick rather than a tub. Most recipes that have called for cold vegan butter you’d cut it into pieces and work it into the recipe without creaming it together with the sugar. It seems like cold butter wouldn’t come together quite right with the sugar. I could see it working if you used a softer tubbed butter. I see she recommends earth balance but I have found that in tubs and also in sticks. Two different textures. Just my two cents…",🤔

Anyway, aside from that, the recipe seems fine… I would definitely chill the dough for a couple of hours or overnight, and THEN roll into balls and bake. Try using a silicone baking mat, they grip the cookie and help avoid over-spreading as well. 

Also, if you want to try a different recipe altogether, here is one that I found a few months ago and have made over ten times now, with different add-ins and comes out amazing every time.

It's easier to make substitutions, like OP did, if you first understand what every ingredients does, substituting regular flour for oat flour removes the binding added by gluten in wheat flour, I think that's the main issue here, then they added applesauce because the dough wasn't sticking together, it didn't stick bc it didn't have gluten, and the applesauce adds more water that contribute to the instability of the dough.

Also the attitude is high enough to take in consideration but OP said they did, and also the butter, the recipe suggests one particular brand, maybe the water and fat content of the butter is also important. 

I would look for a recipe using just oat flour if that's what I want to use instead of substitute wheat flour.",

kqttrv6,t1_kqs02n2,1aor82n,I agree. It’s weird that people aren’t suggesting that OP follow the recipe exactly first and are giving all these other suggestions.,
kq3v93y,t1_kq1l415,1aor82n,Your cookies might be spreading like that because oat flour doesn't have the gluten required to create a chemical structure to hold them together. Consider using a recipe that's designed specifically for oat flour or switching to a high-quality gluten-free flour substitute. I believe Bob's Red Mill offers a pretty good one.,
kq4uvzx,t1_kq1l415,1aor82n,"In my experience cookies where flour is replaced with oat flour tend to spread less. Cookies that spread too much are usually because the dough is ""too wet"" either because the ingredients are too warm (oversoftened butter, etc) or too much moisture is added.

When I used to bake as my fulltime job a process we used when new recipes didn't turn out like we'd expected we would make a recipe as is and bake one item at a time. This doesn't really work with yeasted recipes or laminated doughs but works for almost anything else. So make the entire batch of dough, bake a single cookie, if it spread too much - separate another cookie worth of dough and add some more flour to that. I would say somewhere between a tsp or a tbsp to see how it would change it and bake another single cookie. Its tedious but if you really want to diagnose an issue sometimes small iterations are your best option. Ive never baked at high altitude but a quick search online seems like reducing the baking soda should help. Maybe remove it entirely and see how it turns out. Not sure about that aspect.

Otherwise I would try the following:
1. Make your dough then chill it for an hour and bake it cold

2. Use colder butter

3. Reduce the moisture ingredients (omit the applesauce you added or instead of 12 Tbsp [3/4 cup] of butter - use 10)

4. Double check your measuring equipment; verify they're accurate. 

5. Quadruple check your measurements are correct. I've had people double check my measurements before to make sure I haven't miscalculated conversions before.

6. Using a scale is usually the most reliable option. I know your recipe's measurements aren't in grams but you can convert it like so: 
1¼ cup flour = 150g
1 cup rolled oats = 80g
¾ cup butter = 12 Tbsp = 168g
½ cup sugar = 100g
½ cup brown sugar = ~110g

7. Increase your oven temperature",

However, if you do bake some right away, I would still put them in the freezer for like 20-30 minutes to reduce spread. Last night, I just microwaved some of the cookie dough (just enough to soften the chocolate chips) and ate that.  It’s really hard to not have a little something right away!",

kqnggpn,t1_kqnfol3,1arsx3n,"Yay 😁!  They do “require” a 12-24 hour chill, however. That being said, no one says you can’t eat some cookie dough while you wait!  

I’ve never tried making these without the chill time. But, if you really can’t wait, then I’d at least freeze them for an hour before baking!  Maybe bake off a small batch and, then, allow the remainder of the dough to chill for the full 12-24 hours. Luckily, the dough, itself, is super easy to make and only dirties two dishes.  Oh, and a quick tip.. when whisking the oil, water, and sugar together, it may seem like it doesn’t wanna’ come together. But, it absolutely will. Just whisk whisk whisk :) 

I love baking these super soft. For me, that means they’re done in 7-8 minutes (ymmv). Then, I let them sit on the tray, outside the oven for at least another 5-7 minutes. Hope you enjoy them :)!",😁

However, that’s only because I didn’t have any more AP Flour— I have made these cookies before with AP Flour, as called for, and they came out just fine!  If you get to the end and you feel the dough is a little too wet, just add a couple more tbsp of flour. It won’t ruin them. I would consider this recipe to be very well-tested. Definitely do the 12 hour chill.  A 24 hour chill would be even better. Use dark brown sugar, not light. The recipe says you can user either— use dark. Before baking, put them in the freezer for about 20 minutes. 

I think you will have luck with these :)",

It’s just a total coincidence that I have no self control and can never deny myself a few tbsp of cookie dough…

Chilling the dough can really make a world of difference. Well, I suppose that’s a bit of an exaggeration— but, it definitely improves the end product. Color, taste, texture, spread. All these can benefit from a good chill.  I’ll try to make them before bed. Then, it doesn’t feel like you waited as long. Other people make twice the amount and then freeze the already-chilled batch for another time. That way, they have cookies on hand and ready to go for next time.

kqnqlae,t1_kqnqb7f,1arsx3n,"Thank you! Can't wait to try these, and did you say you used coconut oil? Or did I misread a comment",
kqxg5e1,t1_kqv17ye,1arsx3n,"Yeah it’s just a really great, straightforward chocolate chip cookie :). I also really like the vegan chocolate chip cookies from my Little Pine cookbook and a blog called Baker by Nature. 

Here’s the Baker by Nature link: https://bakerbynature.com/the-most-wonderful-vegan-chocolate-chip-cookies-ever/

I also like these: https://thebananadiaries.com/simple-vegan-chocolate-chip-cookies/

And: https://www.reddit.com/r/VeganBaking/comments/17zdnrj/tahini_chocolate_chip_cookies_topped_with_fleur/ these that I made a while ago 

I’m walking on the treadmill right now, but I will type the Little Pine cookbook recipe out later tonight, in a new comment/reply (so you get notified), when I get done :)

Edit: are you familiar with Justine Snacks?  She has some really cool vegan baking recipes that I am dying to try!",
kqqw83i,t1_kqo7gjk,1arsx3n,"I’ve heard a lot of people love it!  When I first made it, I wasn’t super impressed. I was like, “okay. This is good.”  But, this second time around, I like it even more. I did use white whole wheat flour, this time. I wonder if that affected the flavor at all?  

But, seriously, it is a really genius recipe. It seems to work out for everyone. It’s very simple, but the end result is great. Like you said, “never fails!”",
kqn2sqv,t1_kqn2346,1arsx3n,"For context: I live alone with my husband and we generally can’t eat a whole batch of cookies. Although it does happen and then we feel like we ate a ton of cookies and feel awful haha.    
So I usually bake 6 and portion and freeze the rest and bake 4-5 from frozen for after dinner snacks or whatever for whenever we are feeling something sweet.     
It has been really great! I dunno why I waited my entire life (37) and just recently figured out having cookie dough in the freezer is so amazing.",
kqn7a4s,t1_kqn2346,1arsx3n,"Yes, as far as chilling goes, I’ve read that, after 38 hours, there are diminishing returns. No “need” to go further than that, like you said. It sounds like you have a whole system going, though!  Good for you :). My problem is that, if I have cookie dough ready-to-go in the freezer, I will absolutely bake it as soon as the other cookies are gone. Then, I get caught in this cycle of eating cookies nonstop haha. It’s so horrible, but I truly have no self control when it comes to sweets. I had to stop baking for a while because I needed to slow the fuck down. I’m not even kidding, nor exaggerating. I literally gained 30 lbs 😂. I’m losing the weight, but… yeah. I’m a fiend. 

I just went downstairs, prior to seeing your text, and ate 2.3 of these cookies in a row. Now, I feel crappy hahaha. Sometimes you just can’t help it. I should start baking smaller batches, like you. Oh, and, that’s so cool that you had just enough oil. It was meant to be!  I would love to follow your lead and experiment more with this dough, as a base. A birthday cake cookie sounds wonderful. I think this dough would also be great as like a strawberry “cheesecake” cookie. You can really taste the brown sugar in these. Do let me know how your cookies turn out!  

Have you ever heard of Justine Snacks?  If you haven’t, you should check her out. I discovered her some months ago, but I didn’t realize she had so many recipes that would appeal to me, until about 28 hours ago. She has some really awesome-looking recipes. They’re.. refreshing? If that makes sense. Like, it combinations I wouldn’t never have thought of. I will link some below 👇:

Most of her recipes, if not vegan, can be made vegan. She will usually include that when she explains the ingredients and then further explain in the notes. I like that a lot of her dishes are not super generic and run-of-the-mill. Definitely check out her savory dishes, too!  

Here is a link to her landing page: 

https://justinesnacks.com

You can specifically search by “special diet” and then choose “vegan.”  But, I like to just scroll through and save recipes that may not be vegan, because, usually, there’s a way to easily make them vegan. Like, say, they may not be considered vegan because they include Parmesan cheese as a garnish/finisher. No problem, since I can just use vegan parm cheese. You know?  I just went through her blog last night and bookmarked probably two-dozen recipes 😂",😂👇😂
kqmk348,t1_kqmk0ie,1arsx3n,Nothing wrong with that! :) hope you enjoy them!,
kqnr9dk,t1_kqnqlae,1arsx3n,"No problem!  And, nope, I used grapeseed oil. But, the recipe says any neutral oil is fine. Canola oil being another one. 

I had said I didn’t have enough “butter” and that I was running low on coconut oil, so that’s why I decided to make these, specifically :) 

Hope you like ‘em!!",
kqvjf7g,t1_kqqw83i,1arsx3n,"Oh cool! I’ve never tried it with white wheat flour! I tend to find the resting of the dough for 24-48 hours just does something magical to it :) 

I also totally agree with the brown sugar hack too! Makes them so much more flavourful 🥰🥰",🥰🥰
kqngg5y,t1_kqn7a4s,1arsx3n,"Sesame cookies haha! I just made black sesame butter cookies yesterday. They were very grey.    
It inspired me to make some grey elephant bread. Will post on here if I do that.",
kqnfynq,t1_kqn7a4s,1arsx3n,"Amazing! I am saving this.    
I have been converting and tweaking all of the baking recipes from Sally’s Baking Addiction website. Cookies, breads, cheesecakes, just made some croissants that came out PERFECT last month. She also has monthly baking challenges which is super fun and makes me bake things I wouldn’t normally bake.     
I am always searching for fun new things. I get so bored if I eat the same thing over and over. We never eat out so I am always cooking.         
I will post some photos whenever I bake those cookies. If not tomorrow, the next day.

kqxeojg,t1_kqvjf7g,1arsx3n,It really does make a difference! 😊,😊
kqngqox,t1_kqnfynq,1arsx3n,"You made croissants?!  I haven’t made croissants since I switched to vegan baking/vegan, in general. What “butter” did you use for the croissants?!  

I also refuse to eat out. I’d much rather eat/cook/bake at home :) 

I’m very much looking forward to seeing some pictures of your upcoming bakes :)!",
kqnj3h2,t1_kqngqox,1arsx3n,"Yes haha. I used the plant-based Country Crock butter sticks.     
I have never made croissants before, but made her croissant bread last year, very similiar….      
Anyway, I looked up three different croissant recipes, read them all start to finish, watched a video on youtube, then used her recipe, and basic laminating steps, but used an amalgamation of the other recipes to finish with the proofing and bake times. It took me three days because I had sprained my wrist and the rolling/laminating was killing me lol.       
I almost said fuck it on the second day because nothing looked right, it was freezing in my house, but the butter kept squishing out.. I thought the Country Crock wasn’t going to work and started getting flustered, but threw it into the fridge instead of the trash.       
The next day I just said, “it’ll work or it won’t, but this is how we learn.” So I rolled, cut, shaped, proofed, and baked and somehow they came out perfect. Like, I am not exaggerating. They puffed and flaked and zero butter leakage. I assumed they would just pool and scorch the bottoms, but they didn’t. It was incredible, I halved the recipe like usual, so we had eight total I think, we ate six fresh haha, and then the other two the next day and they were still delicious.     
And, kicker, I don’t even *like* croissants! lol",
kqnj7mr,t1_kqngqox,1arsx3n,"I posted some photos of the black sesame butter cookies and the recipe yesterday. It should be on here somewhere. The photos aren’t super great, I was very low effort yesterday haha.",
kqnrgl5,t1_kqnj3h2,1arsx3n,"Quite the tale of perseverance!  I’m glad to hear everything worked out so well!  I am going to try making some vegan croissants very soon. I really like to fill them curds, pastry creams, etc.  Thank you for giving me the push I needed :)!",
kqnjk0c,t1_kqnj3h2,1arsx3n,"I have photos, I don’t have imgur or whatever to post them in the comments. Maybe I should look into that.",
kqt143n,t1_kqnrgl5,1arsx3n,I want to make chocolate croissants next. Never had one. Always have just imagined what they would taste like. Probably heavenly. haha.,
kqxgwzj,t1_kqt143n,1arsx3n,"I’m not a huge chocolate person, but I’m sure you’ll absolutely love them!  I think you have to order the chocolate batons online. I’ve heard that they’re difficult to find otherwise. Have you checked out r/croissant?  There’s some really great advice there. A few of the posters really, really know what they’re doing.

lcw2tnc,t3_1e1qilq,1e1qilq,"Definitely think it’s your pregnancy like everyone else has said, tbh I find that vegan baked good recipes tend to overdo it on the sweetness to overcompensate for the “lack” of animal products (not a real lack obviously but that’s how some people seem to think) and everything is SO sweet, I don’t eat sugar anymore but when I did I would always have to reduce it in any recipes or stick to non-American websites.

lcw57i9,t1_lcw1xt1,1e1qilq,"Haha thank you sm! It’s honestly probably the pregnancy, my boyfriend thinks it’s all really good, and everyone seems to agree.. I suppose my son and the associated hormones might be making me a sugar fiend haha",
lcz106d,t1_lcy6m1x,1e1qilq,"I take the sugar amount from them, and mostly replace eggs with silken tofu + aquafaba (40g silken tofu + 20g aquafaba). It works pretty well, at least for me. 

Can’t think of specific sources, I mostly find them on YouTube and write them down in my notebook. Sorry if I’m not very helpful! I started writing sources down very recently, most of these older notes don’t have the info. 😓",😓
lcwvdso,t1_lcwu2rf,1e1qilq,"I have a sweet tooth also. I find french/european pastries usually far less sweet than what's in your typical american recipe and this is why I like them more.

Also, I promise I'm not concern trolling. But please be careful with sugar. If you are craving it so badly you might want to talk to your doctor. It increases the risk of gestational diabetes and type 2 diabetes in the child if you carry to term.

Wishing you a safe and happy day + happy baking.",
lczh8a6,t1_lcz106d,1e1qilq,Oh no that's quite helpful. I tried chia and flax but it only works in a few recipes. Are there any other egg replacements you've found to work? I can make aquafaba here but silken tofu isn't easily available where I live. Thank you.,

lfwrv5c,t3_1egykfz,1egykfz,There’s a great cheesecake recipe in Phil Khoury’s cookbook that doesn’t use vegan cream cheese- just silken tofu and some other more or less basic ingredients.,
lfx3q60,t3_1egykfz,1egykfz,Definitely Tofutti for cheesecake. Its texture is perfect and it never splits or turns grainy when whipped for long periods unlike some others.,
lfwgi5d,t3_1egykfz,1egykfz,Tofutti haven't let me down throughout the years and so many different recipes...it always works,
lfxwpcv,t3_1egykfz,1egykfz,Kite hill tastes the closest to me. I’ve been vegan for 14 years and tofutti was an acquired taste. Maybe it’s better now….,

lfy5o74,t3_1egykfz,1egykfz,Oatley cream cheese works really well! I've done baked tarts with a small dab of it in the centers. I just add a little sweetener and lemon zest/juice,

lfvv3ak,t1_lfvpg2t,1egykfz,"I don't use any butter in mine. Here's my recipe:



2 8 oz. Tubs Tofutti Cream Cheese, room temperature

3/4 C Cane Sugar

1/4 C Cornstarch

1 tsp Lemon Juice

2 tsp Pure Vanilla Extract

3 Tbsp Coconut Oil, melted


In a stand mixer or with a handheld mixer, cream Tofutti until smooth. Add in sugar and mix until incorporated. Add in cornstarch and mix until incorporated. Add in lemon juice, melted coconut oil, and vanilla extract. Fold by hand until uniform and all ingredients are incoprorated. Do not overmix.


Pour filling into crust. Bake at 350 °F for 1 hour. Let cool for 2-3 hours, then place in fridge for at least 8 hours to set.


For the crust I just make a basic graham cracker crust.",

lfwuayo,t1_lfwrgal,1egykfz,"Yes I love the vanilla Kite Hill yogurt but I don’t buy it very often unless it’s BOGO 😉 I wish the texture was a little bit thicker, but it’s so good over fruit.

I make a key lime tart using the KH cream cheese and my non-vegan family can’t tell the difference in the tart filling. So yummy.",😉
lfxy9f6,t1_lfxvosm,1egykfz,"It’s sort of like a Japanese style, lemon-y, light and delicious baked cheesecake. Not like the no-bake creamy ones, if that’s what you’re after!

I don’t usually make vegan food, but this cake is vegan by nature, super simple, one bowl, and always a crowd pleaser. Most recipes are for chocolate but it’s easy enough to find a recipe for vanilla. 

The cake recipe was developed in the depression era when people didn’t necessarily have eggs or milk on hand. The cake is leavened with baking soda and vinegar!",
lde5aq2,t1_lddwoov,1e46188,"Ermine is one of my favorite kinds of frosting. The texture is similar to whipped cream so it’s wonderfully light, but it’s also very stable. This cake stood up to 90* outdoor temperatures and the frosting didn’t slide at all! 

It’s also less sweet than other types of frosting, which I like. Since ermine recipes don’t call for powdered sugar, I find that my kitchen ends up less sticky overall lol

lde9du5,t1_lde6c77,1e46188,"Any ermine frosting recipe will work! Just sub dairy milk with a vegan replacement of your choice and the butter with your favorite plant-based option. I’d recommend a stick over a tub (which is true for almost all baking applications). 

The frosting is thickened and stabilized by cooking a “pudding” of milk, flour, and sugar together. When it’s thick, you cool it to room temp, and then whip it together with room temp butter. 

It’s very important that your pudding and butter are both room temp! Otherwise, they won’t incorporate smoothly. Also, I’d suggest that you scape down your bowl thoroughly several times during the whipping process so it all gets incorporated and aerated. 

You can see in my pic that some of the outside is a bit yellow. That’s due to frosting where the sides of the bowl weren’t thoroughly scraped and then I did touch ups with it. Looking back, that’s one thing I’d be more careful about in the future!",

lz62393,t3_1h0r9te,1h0r9te,Maybe crushed almonds all over? Or coconut flakes? Or whipped cream right before serving and some shaved chocolate sprinkled in it?,
lz634sg,t3_1h0r9te,1h0r9te,Small chocolate chips or chocolate shavings?,
lz6dwqx,t3_1h0r9te,1h0r9te,Fruit could add some color!,
lz6ofb4,t3_1h0r9te,1h0r9te,Sprinkle chopped nuts over the pie and even your can drizzle caramel sauce. It enhance the visual appearance.,
lz6pd55,t3_1h0r9te,1h0r9te,Mandala with almonds and berries,
lz7rzpe,t3_1h0r9te,1h0r9te,I would cut up some Berries! And spread them around,
lz7tir3,t3_1h0r9te,1h0r9te,Sprinkle chopped hazelnuts all over store bought chocolate sprinkles?,
lzbk6eb,t3_1h0r9te,1h0r9te,First thought that was a garlic star. So maybe i would chop them and sprinkle it over the cake,

lz6evqw,t1_lz6dwqx,1h0r9te,That's a good idea! Strawberries would go with the chocolate.,
lza0nbo,t1_lz6ofb4,1h0r9te,Mm that sounds great. Don’t have any caramel sauce on hand but chopped nuts sound great. What nuts would you go with? I tried almonds in the second pic. Would you sprinkle them in some particular arrangement or just all over?,

lza03mm,t1_lz66zqc,1h0r9te,The crust is nutter butter :) should I put whipped cream all over or just a dollop in the middle and then the cookie on top of the dollop?,
lza0ens,t1_lz6evqw,1h0r9te,I was thinking strawberries or blueberries. I just didn’t know how to decorate them. I’m not very artistic lol. Just one strawberry in the middle with a circle of blueberries around or something like that?,

You could also do a chocolate drizzle alongside if you'd like. Then I'd get some nondairy whipped cream in the can because it has the fancy star tip nozzle and do rosettes all around the edges. Then you can put half a nutter butter in the rosettes. Kinda [like this](https://www.sugarhero.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/03/peanut-butter-pie-2_thumb.jpg), but with the cut side of the nutter butter facing down. Here's [another example](https://i.pinimg.com/736x/ed/d3/29/edd329418820efa5f220dace832bc084.jpg) with drizzle, though they also used whipped cream all over.

l0j8ejf,t1_l0j7a6v,1c87j43,"They didn’t, but they were all eaten within two days. I did keep them in Tupperware. Not sure if that changed anything and I’m sure you do the same thing. Was it this specific recipe you had a problem with, or just this type of cookie?",
l0o27oe,t1_l0o0j4k,1c87j43,"Same here :) I’m fairly new to vegan baking. I went vegan like… five months ago?  I think.  By no means am I as experienced as most people here. 

These were very moist on the inside, yes.  When I took these pictures, they had been out of the oven for well over an hour. The chocolate that’s melted is actually chopped up chocolate bar (I put some chopped chocolate and some chips). You can see the chocolate chips, however, are already pretty solid again. So, these are nice and moist, even when not hot. I ate these cookies the next day, too, and the insides were still nice and soft. I like the inside to be doughy, and they were 100% still like that the next day. Not as extreme as when it comes out of the oven of course, but it was definitely still what I would consider a bit doughy. 

The outermost part of the cookie is a bit crispy. I’m not sure if crispy is really the best word, but it’s a nice contrast between the soft, doughy middle. 

I hope that helps!  I actually made some more cookies today that I’m about to post, which are also XL, but not as rounded and tall. I got that recipe from here: https://labelessnutrition.com/vegan-levain-chocolate-chip-walnut-cookies/ I’m just kind of experimenting with different Levain-type recipes so that I can, eventually, make my own recipe. So far, I have really enjoyed them all.",
l0d7tgt,t1_l0d6m19,1c87j43,"Lol, Thanx!",

l0j8k0s,t1_l0j8ejf,1c87j43,It was a specific recipe but I made cookies twice and had the same problem. They were good fresh but got so hard so fast…… 🤣,🤣
l0o498j,t1_l0o27oe,1c87j43,"I see. I've been mainly doing it for a period of months, too.  
Good to know more on the texture. Just curious about that with baking being so specific, and vegan recipes not being something I'm familiar with.  
Good luck on your cookie quest.",
l3sr4c4,t1_l3pnzdt,1c87j43,No problem!  It’s a huge compliment and thank *you* for asking ❤️,❤
l0jpf6w,t1_l0j8k0s,1c87j43,Hmm I’m not sure what would be causing that!  I’m sorry that keeps happening to you. Sometimes I’ve found that the cookies actually taste better after sitting for a bit. Maybe try this recipe if you like extra big cookies?,
l0ok0b7,t1_l0o498j,1c87j43,"Understandable!  Your knowledge of non-vegan baking will carry you much of the way. Trust yourself :)!  I had wrongfully assumed, for a while, that ingredients would behave differently just because I was now baking “vegan.”  There’s a little bit of truth to that, sure, but most of that was psychological. I know when something looks right before I bake it, usually.  I’m sure you do, too. So, I try not to overthink things and assume stuff like, “oh, this dough is just wet/slack because it’s vegan.”  A couple different ingredients, some slightly different methodology, yeah. But, generally, you know what you’re looking for and what makes sense.  Lean on your prior baking knowledge. I’ve actually found vegan baking to be even more forgiving, so far. You’ll be good!  

(Hope that made sense) 

Happy vegan baking and thank you for the well wishes as I continue on my cookie quest :)",
l0on4fo,t1_l0ok0b7,1c87j43,"Thanks for the additional insight on not overthinking it and it not being too incredibly different. I mean, I'm sure certain things might be more challenging or a different method, but I can see how a lot of more basic things might not be. I'm so curious about the taste and texture of things, and wonder how different it would be in that respect, too, which is why I asked you about what you made. There are definitely times when a non-vegan recipe can turn out a certain way and sometimes it's even an error in the writing of the recipe.  
I've heard specifically that vegan buttercream is maybe less stable because of the different structure of vegan butter, but I don't know if that's always the case.",
l0owsxz,t1_l0on4fo,1c87j43,"I’m not sure. I’ve actually yet to make vegan buttercream because I haven’t had a reason to make cake, yet. I’m not sure about the stability of vegan buttercream, but what instantly came to mind was Gretchen’s Vegan Bakery. 

If you haven’t heard of it, here is the link:  https://www.gretchensveganbakery.com 

Her cakes look really awesome and she even has a recipe for a buttercream that’s made from apples!  You’ll probably like her videos, if that sort of stuff interests you. The video I saw on the Apple frosting was pretty in-depth. 

Here it is: https://youtu.be/Afw_MM6g27s?si=v83wbfIF4nUeIlnt

Here is her icings and fillings page, from her website:  https://www.gretchensveganbakery.com/category/icings-and-fillings/ 
 
She also has a cookbook. Anyway, I just thought that apple buttercream was so interesting. It was really stable, too. I don’t like the way her brownies look, however. Far too cakey for me. Not fudgy enough. For that, I’d go to Rainbow Plant Life or Short & Sötma (which is basically Rainbow Plant Life’s recipe, made with a more stable aquafaba meringue. She achieves this by reducing down the aquafaba and adding agar agar flakes). The recipe for those brownies is here:  https://www.shortandsotma.com/blog/vegan-brownies You can still get the crackle top and everything. 

I’ve also been told Addicted to Dates is good resource. She was a professional pastry chef, so she knows her stuff. I actually never verified that. I was just old that by somebody on this sub, and I’m sticking with it haha 

https://addictedtodates.com 

There’s also this woman, Saloni Mehta. She’s a Dubai pastry chef that bakes vegan. Her IG is here:  https://www.instagram.com/pastrybysaloni?igsh=MTl0aGpndDI5bnpzbg==

Theres also this really amazing-looking chocolate cake made by School Night Vegan, here:  https://youtu.be/NKsziT1wkZk?si=OWUL8DR32kfhID_D 

Anyway, sorry. Went off on a bit of a tangent, there. I’m not super knowledgeable when it comes to more technical understandings of baking and I don’t know much about cakes and cake-related things, as I never make them. But, maybe those sources can help to satisfy your inquisitive mind!",
l0ozd4k,t1_l0owsxz,1c87j43,"Thanks a lot for all of the links! I haven't done much searching on the subject yet, as I've been dealing with a medical situation and haven't really been in the mood for baking for a while anyway. I happened to see your post in my home feed and commented due to my curiosity still existing at times.  
I hope I'll be up for trying some of these things someday, so I'll definitely check these out and save them for the future. I have so much baking equipment and don't want it to become useless due to the dietary change. Right now it's just been due to my other situation not really encouraging me to do baking.  
It's good to know that some of these people were pastry chefs and might have a lot of insight and experience that could be useful.  
Never heard of apples in buttercream! Interesting. I'll definitely check that out. I don't/didn't often do cakes either. And not long ago discovered homemade cake pops are pretty good and can be fun to decorate, and I enjoy them more than traditional cake. Those have a chocolate/candy coating and don't strictly require buttercream to be mixed in, but you can if you want. But since it just gets absorbed in the baked cake before being balled up, the stability wouldn't really matter as much, as long as your dough isn't too greasy and holds together.  
Thanks again! And once again good luck on the cookie quest.",
l0p20rc,t1_l0ozd4k,1c87j43,"I’m sorry you’re struggling, right now. I do hope that you can get back into baking and enjoy it, again, soon!  I actually almost lost my leg a little over a year ago. I got into baking because I couldn’t work. I’m still healing, now, but it’s a lot better. My point is, I understand how therapeutic baking can be, so I really do hope you can figure out something that works for you. 

I have heard of/seen cake pops, but I only tried making them many years ago. This was long before I was baking somewhat regularly. I used boxed cake mix and store-bought frosting. The method I followed was mixing the frosting in with the cake, rolling it into balls, freezing, and dipping in chocolate. It’s a cute idea. They definitely had their moment for quite a while, there! Baking trends are so interesting. Now, the chocolate chip cookie croissant is having its moment. It’s always something haha 

I also think that there are lots of “accidentally vegan” store-bought frostings. For example, I have a Zero Sugar Creamy Supreme Chocolate Fudge Frosting from Pillsbury. No dairy, nor eggs. It does contain palm oil, which I hate, but I didn’t buy this one. Anyway, point is, you’ll find that plenty of these frostings are already vegan. Many boxed-cake mixes are also accidentally vegan.  Maybe you can make your cake pops that way! 

Here’s a link about veganizing boxed cake mix:  https://www.connoisseurusveg.com/veganize-cake-mix/ Just check the ingredients and google which ones are vegan, so you know which ones to look for, in the first place. 

And, yes, buttercream made from apples!  I also just learned that they actually make bags/purses from apple peels, too!  And cactus leather.  They look really nice. I forget the company, but I’m sure, if you google “bag made from apple peels,” it’ll come up. 

Anyway, no need to respond to this comment. It’s really just so you had some more information. I wish you well!  Thank you, again!  :)",
l0tjs0y,t1_l0p20rc,1c87j43,"Thank you.   
Wow, good luck with the continued healing from the leg situation. I'm getting there, I think/hope. If I can avoid procedures, I will.  
I've been paying attention to ingredients in things more now, so yeah, sometimes things are vegan when they don't state it. And I never had a cake pop in my life til I made them myself this year, lol. A bit late.  
Thanks for the extra info. I actually mainly came back here to respond to share this with you... I found a vegan fudgy brownie recipe with a crackly top. I haven't tried it yet, but the person who made the recipe apparently attempted a lot of ways and eventually found this to be their favorite.  
[https://eatwithclarity.com/homemade-vegan-brownies/](https://eatwithclarity.com/homemade-vegan-brownies/)  
It also gives you the option of using flax OR applesauce in case you think the flax may affect the flavor, which the creator doesn't think it does but some people claim it does.  
The method seems to be part of helping get the texture that they were going for, which is the fudgy inside with the crackly top. And it doesn't require any 'extra' or less common ingredients. Seems simple! Think I'll have to try them sometime.  
Anyway, just wanted to share that. I may be mistaken that you mentioned brownies at some point, maybe it was someone else.",

I’ve seen some people only use flood consistency for this step but I wanted a bit more control because I’m still learning. After they dried overnight I took a portion of my royal icing and added more powdered sugar to make it super stiff and thick.

An issue I find though is even though, and I’m going to do my best to explain this.. 
I use stick butter (I am in the US and use Earth Balance butter). I have a scale and use the grams, oz, ml, etc. and try to find recipes that use these metrics, but with the vegan butter I find that the amounts are definitely not the same. So let’s say whatever the weight is for 6 tablespoons of butter, if I use 6 tablespoons of vegan butter my dish is a disaster. I always need to significantly scale back. With my basic cookie recipe, I’ve learned the amount that works, so it’s easy to throw together. I’m always confused how people successfully use the vegan butter. ",

I do enjoy trying different cuisines from other cultures. My “issue” is finding a true authentic recipe. Google just gives you the most popular (or I assumed sometimes the pages that pay to be at the top).. so I often find myself sifting through the internet until I find what I think is authentic.. or sounds authentic. 

I will take this suggestion though and try to find some new cultures to research and try. 😊",😊

I actually have Nora Cooks up for a vanilla cake recipe. 
I was looking for a recipe to make a birthday cake for myself and I narrowed it down to Minimalist Baker (someone else on this thread said they haven’t had luck with hers though), Nora Cooks, and a one or two others as a back up. 
I put Nora’s recipe 2nd since I don’t have much experience with aquafaba and I’m a bit nervous to try a whole cake with it! 

If Minimalist Baker fails, I will give Nora’s a try since I don’t have much to lose at that point.

Wait at least a couple of hours or overnight; the cake can feel cool on the outside but still be releasing warmth from the inside that melts the frosting. That can help with the melty look of the frosting and the top layer sliding off.  It will also help the sliding if you're not trying to balance the flat bottom of one layer on top of the dome of the layer below. You can trim off the dome on the bottom layer (and the top layer of you want the cake to look flat on top), or if you're afraid to trim then flip the bottom layer upside down before you start frosting to give the top layer a more stable base. ",

Also, what a lovely and kind gesture you're doing. You are a wonderful friend. 🥹

I'd do a spin on Carribbean/Soul food.

Big pot of rice.

Chickpea curry.

Stewed jerk flavoured red kidney beans/lentils.

Mac N cheese (you can make the sauce with soaked and blended cashews[nutritional yeast is a must to get that cheesy flavour.])

Spring greens or kale.

Buffalo cauliflower bites.

Coleslaw.

Friend plantain or dumplings.

This way everyone can either help themselves family style or you can just dish up a little spoon of each on a plate for them.

Orrrr failing that just do a big batch of spaghetti Bolognese with garlic bread. You can easily replace the mince with finely chopped mushrooms or lentils.

lek6o94,t3_1ea6ddj,1ea6ddj,"Ooh I would do cauliflower tikka masala, Bombay potatoes and peas, some rice, and then these awesome curry spiced beef puffs (these are a crowd PLEASER at events, people go absolutely apeshit for them, they’re even super tasty the next day right out of the fridge!!)

1lb impossible meat or other ground beef substitute 

1/2 onion, chopped finely

1/2 red bell pepper, stemmed and coarsely chopped

2 garlic cloves, grated

2 tsp sweet curry powder (I sometimes will add more, go to your taste and you can’t go wrong!)

2 tsp paprika

1 tsp cumin

1 tsp hot sauce (whatever you like, or you can even leave this out)

S+P to taste

1/2 cup soft bread crumbs (literally whatever bread you have in the fridge, clawed at with a fork until crumb texture is reached)

1-2 packages frozen vegan puff pastry dough (this depends on how much filling you stuff in your puffs, I generally have extra filling if I only buy one package of dough)


In a large pan set to medium, drizzle in some oil and lightly brown the onion, pepper and garlic. Once they’ve softened up, push them off to the side of the pan to continue to cook, add a bit more oil and press the impossible meat or ground beef substitute into the pan to brown on one side, then flip it, brown the other side and then roughly chop it up into crumbles with your spatula. Combine beef crumbles and veggies and add in all remaining ingredients. Turn heat off. Filling can be transferred to a bowl to cool if you’d like (I don’t like making extra dishes for myself). 


Now, set the puff pastry out to thaw according to package suggestion, dust work surface with a little flour and gently roll out with a rolling pin to ensure even thickness and stretch any areas that may need it. Cut each sheet into roughly 3”x 3” squares (they don’t need to be perfect squares, so no need to waste any pastry dough, just eyeball the sheet, I think my pillsbury sheets make 9 puffs per sheet). 


Before this step, make sure your filling is room temp or cooler. Put a rounded tablespoon of filling in the center of each square, wet the seam of two sides of puff pastry, and fold the corner over to make a little triangle puff. I also press the seams gently with a fork. As you form your puffs, pop them in the fridge to chill for at least 30 minutes before baking. 


When you’re ready to bake, preheat your oven to 425 and bake for 15-20 min or until golden brown! I like to eat them dipped in hot sauce but they’re awesome on their own! Good luck!!",

Cassava Cake 

2 packages frozen/grated Cassava (1lb each)
1 lb grated unsweetened coconut 
1 can coconut cream (unsweetened)
2 cups granulated white sugar
Tsp vanilla 

Mix all ingredients together and pour into a greased 9x13 pan. Bake at 350 degrees for 75-90 minutes.

lekga0r,t3_1ea6ddj,1ea6ddj,"Depends on where you're located (you said you're from a culture that uses a lot of meat) so I'm not sure what you'd have available at the stores, but a few things we make when we have guests that are crowd-pleasers...

Pot pie! Either tofu or chickpeas instead of chicken, homemade pie crust

Tacos - have a few filling options so there's something for everyone. Favorites for me are refried beans, tofu ""sofritas"" and roasted cauliflower, with guac, lettuce, vegan queso, etc.

Falafel and pita - [cookieandkate.com](http://cookieandkate.com) has an amazing falafel recipe. You can buy pita at the store or make them if you're a good baker. Make a tahini sauce and some pickled red onions, and have other toppings like tomatoes, cucumbers, pickles, olives, hummus...

  
For dessert, you could do some kind of cake or pie. Fruit pies are easily made vegan if you sub butter in the crust for vegan butter. Cakes are also easily made vegan, tons of recipes online. A nice bundt cake wouldn't require icing either, making it easier! My favorite vegan dessert is this, though. Weigh the ingredients and they come out perfect every single time.

l07psit,t1_kz4mtpx,1c1ccxe,"Sorry for the late response...

What I would suggest is following the recipe as is for the egg replacer powder: whip up the replacer powder and water until it thick and foamy, add the sugar & keep whipping until thick.

Take about 1/3 of the whipped foam and blend it into the butter.  The replacer powder contains emulsifiers and will be able to produce a smooth, emulsified mixture.

Then beat in the foam as you would with the whites.

The only thing to remember is that you may need to use more hydrated, whipped replacer powder than you would use to replace the eggs.  Instead of whipping up enough powder to equal 5 eggs, you whip up enough powder to equal 8-10 eggs.

Let me know how it turns out.",
kz66ke8,t1_kz4mwoj,1c1ccxe,"That looks absolutely delicious.


For this recipe I would use Aquafaba for  both the egg yolks and the whites. 


For the yolks - 1 tablespoon aquafaba = 1 egg yolk. It will mix best and bring you the best results with the sugar and vanilla sugar for that same texture.


For the whites - 2 tablespoons aquafaba = 1 egg white. You can whipp them with a high speed mixer to get creepily close to the egg white peaks you are looking for


In case you don't know Aquafaba is the liquid in a can of chickpeas. I know it sounds weird, trust me it will be worth it. ",

I also read online that some people just dont like canola taste in cakes even if it is fresh oil, so I could just be sensitive to that flavor. 

But I also did make some brownies today with the same canola oil and I can not taste that taste in it at all so that makes me question if it is the oil or if it is something else.

How would that happen? Absorbed it from where? 

>Try a smaller batch with fresh oil? Maybe your oil has an additive in it that is making the cake taste funny, so try a different brand?

It could be the oil, although I just made brownee ""cupcakes"" and used the same oil and I cant taste it there. But it has other strong flavors like chocolate and mint to it. The vanilla cake is more barebones with just sugar and vanilla being the prominent tastes so it could easily display the taste of the oil.

I had one escapee tiny peice of potato that had hidden at the back of my oven and only found it because everything tasted burnt.

Its not the cleanest, its been a while since I did clean it. But it does not transfer tastes to other things so either that isnt it or the vanilly cake is just so mild in taste that all additional tastes will bleed through easier.",

Idk if you've ever stored something dry near bananas but take it from me, if you keep something like icing sugar near bananas, then it will start to taste faintly of banana. Taste is largely scent-based so it only takes a little of the aromatic compounds to give other things a slight scent, and so, also a taste. Something plain like a vanilla cake with oil is particularly likely to pick up a scent/taste from my experience. Especially oily scents as the chemicals are more similar so can bond with eachother fairly easy.",

Instead of egg, I make aquafaba gel. Reduce aquafaba to a thicker, almost jelly texture, but still pourable. I do this in the microwave. 

Instead of butter: half miyokos cultured butter, half earth balance sticks or Trader Joe’s vegan butter. This blend is crucial!

Add: 2 tablespoons molasses. Butter fat increases browning, so when you don’t have it, molasses adds richness and color. 


The style above might not be exactly what you’re after, but you could try my substitution methods in the America’s Test Kitchen chocolate chip cookies. The miyokos butter will brown some, and you’ll get the sheen on top. Be sure to whisk and let them rest as directed, then refrigerate over night. Underbake slightly to get the centers to sink.

I didn’t feel like they were gummy at all either. The key is to make sure the vegan buttermilk (milk + apple cider vinegar) sits for 5-10 minutes before mixing it with the rest of the batter. This curdles the milk to create a thicker fluffier pancake.

Really not bad for a fourth cake! The decoration on top and the drizzle really jazz it up. and you've got it covered pretty smoothly.  
Also... you mentioned vegan heavy cream... That's a thing?? Do you use a certain brand or might it be hard to find?

It gives me more power to choose how to fill the needs of the recipe, the fats, the proteins, etc. That's just my opinion, of course. 

Country Crock has a plant based heavy cream that I just found! It was amazing to work with and it tastes delicious. I've been able to get by without heavy cream in recipes, dealing out for just plant based milk, but it's nice to have an actual option!",

I have recently heard that you can brown vegan butter though if you use one with the right base! Others I've read you'd have to add something else to in order for it to work.  
I'll have to look out for the heavy cream. Have you actually tried using it to make whipped cream before? It's not something I've done or used often, but would definitely be good to have the option. Even for some sauces maybe.",

l445v2c,t1_l42yp5s,1cs4xz7,"Curious to know your view on having any kind of pets at all, such as domestic cats or anything even. It seems the argument about anything being humane (if you feel that way about any free range animal products) would come down to it not being completely natural, yet in many cases animals end up living longer and healthier lives with human care and/or intervention. Of course many of them that end up relying on or needing assistance or care would possibly not have come about without human intervention in the first place. In some cases.  
And then, if that's what it comes down to, not being 'natural,' then I wonder what one would say when examining most humans' daily life/lifestyle choices, and things that could arguably not be natural there. Seems there would be contradictions and such in most cases.  
It seems people disagree on various topics like this even within the vegan community, as of course not everyone of any mindset or lifestyle seems to agree fully on everything.   
In a sense, it seems some could argue the lack of how natural human controlled plant growth for cultivation is (for the plants anyway, as they too could exist without humans as could animals, both can be hurt or helped). I'm not saying I personally feel that it equates one to one with factory farming animals at all.  
The intention wasn't really to begin a whole new thread of things here, so my responses may be limited or few so as not to take over the original post and its intent.",
l446avu,t1_l42yt5u,1cs4xz7,"I think I read somewhere someone mentioned something about flax eggs and it making something greasy, but they were trying to adapt a recipe with it, so perhaps it didn't work as well. I don't know though. I have no idea what flax egg is like. Have you seen anyone argue that it changes anything with taste or texture?  
When you say for egg wash you use aqua fava (assuming that's aquafaba) or just egg, is 'just egg' a product or something you're referring to, or do you mean you sometimes use flax egg to do a wash?  
And do you make your own aquafaba or buy it? Does it keep long if you make your own somehow?  
Lol, you don't have to answer all of this, you can tell me to just go read or something. But thanks for replying.",
l4476uc,t1_l443upe,1cs4xz7,"This is my first time trying the heavy cream, so I haven't used it to make Whipped Cream yet. I bought it at Fred Meyer (Krogers), so hopefully, it'll be easy for you to find (in the states anyway). 

I've been wanting to try browning vegan butter! I haven't gotten around to it because I'm too lazy to research it yet. I've been substituting since I went vegan because I was an avid baker and didn't want to overhaul my recipes or make everything with coconut milk/ oil/ applesauce (seriously, why do so many recipes have this same stuff in it?!). I figured either I'd lose a batch of cookies and/or figure something out about baking. Win win! Plus there's so much good info on the internet about how to and why certain replacements work or don't. YouTube is my best friend 😆",😆
l44zwsj,t1_l445v2c,1cs4xz7,"lol I'm not reading your hysterical apologist novella, animal abuser. pipe down and go suck down some free range eggs 🤡",🤡
l448d0y,t1_l446avu,1cs4xz7,"Oh, yes, I meant Aquafaba 😆 I usually use leftover from cans of chickpeas that I already use for other dishes. I just save it in the fridge if I've got something planned. I've thought about making my own, but I don't want to go through the trouble of reducing the juice after cooking the chickpeas. 

Just Egg is a product that's like scrambled eggs in a carton. It's amazing to use as an egg wash and really easy if you've already got it on hand, but it's kinda spendy to buy just as an egg wash. I suppose you could completely sub out eggs using that as well. However, I've never done it with a baked good. I have made Quiche and Frittatas with it, and they're absolutely delicious!

Flax egg has never caused a recipe of mine to become greasy. I wonder if maybe their recipe was a miss? I know some folks believe that Flax gives it a slightly nuttier flavor to baked goods, but I haven't ever noticed that. Maybe if I was making something with light and delicate flavors, but often I'm making things like Gochujang Caramel cookies and Chocolate Babka sooo lol

I hope that helps?",😆
l44dva8,t1_l4476uc,1cs4xz7,"Don't have a krogers near me but hopefully one of the grocery stores will have it. Unfortunately vegan isn't a big thing here so sometimes it's been harder to find certain things, or the versions of them I wanted. I'll have to check for that though.  
Yeah, I heard that one of the nut based vegan butters, I think miyokos brand (which also makes an oat based butter spread, not the same), can be browned, because the nut protein in it will play the part of the milk protein that browns. I think that was what was said.  
That's so great that you were able to modify your previous recipes... I feel like that's a big thing for me too because I was a baker also and I have so... so... so many recipes that it's ridiculous. If I could be called a hoarder of anything I guess it'd be recipes. Mostly digital but I ended up printing quite a lot too over time. I have many that I never got to try yet and a lot which I did and really liked. So I hated the thought of having to get rid of them/start over. Even the task of testing some with substitutes felt overwhelming for some reason.  
Baking hasn't been a priority for a while for me, though, anyway, due to dealing with an injury/health situation but if I ever get back to it then it's good to know that substituting has worked for you, as I've seen some people say to just stick to recipes that are already vegan so you don't have to worry about this or that.",
l48im3v,t1_l44zwsj,1cs4xz7,"Whether you supposedly read this or not, doesn't matter. It stands for anyone else who happens along.  
I don't know whether you're being serious or not with the above, nor care. Easily could be one way or the other. I find it a really odd/misplaced response though if so. There was no hysteria or apologetic intent either. So you either read it and mistook it or lack the capacity to communicate or think properly. Or you didn't and are just making blind claims on something you didn't read... and felt the need to say so for some reason.  
I couldn't have felt more calm. Pipe down? Is that what you need? I couldn't feel at all upset by someone with responses like yours, ever. Disappointed but not surprised, at the most. My response to yours was of honest curiosity and observation/thought. You chose to insert yourself toward my original comment to something that you weren't involved in.. And only to reply with something this useless.  
I don't mind whether you respond or not, and won't further take away from the original purpose of OP's post or my original comments to it. This reply is more for the sake of anyone else coming across this. Responses like yours to what I wrote and its intention are what give a negative general impression of vegans for some, unfortunately. I can see why, which is why I don't usually bother engaging in this manner in the community on reddit. Though not everyone behaves like you, so sometimes it might be worth it.  
If you cared about others caring about animals, or were willing to define your definition of abuse or viewpoint on any observations/curiosity stated, I'd think you'd actually bother, if capable, responding in a very different manner to such things, otherwise you just drive people away (or even make them want to oppose more if they already do) with childish, basic, unhelpful crap like that.  
I expected a high possibility of a response that made it not worth posting the previous reply, as there was nothing gained.",
l44ekw9,t1_l448d0y,1cs4xz7,"I see. Yeah, canned is definitely easier anyway. And I didn't even realize you'd have to reduce it down, but that makes sense.  
Ok, I have looked for fake egg in cartons but hadn't seen any so far around me. Maybe some store has it, but I don't know. Interesting that you can cook it like quiche or maybe use it for omelettes then. I've recently found recipes for vegan omelettes/eggs that use chickpea flour and tofu maybe or something else, stuff blended together to make a batter and then fry or bake it. I did make a potato/veggie hash casserole with a chickpea flour/tofu batter recently, which worked out pretty well. But chickpea flour isn't the most affordable kind. The benefit is in it having protein I guess, which I wanted.  
Yeah, perhaps something else went on with the recipe or they don't know what it was that made it turn out that way.  
I've also heard something about people thinking flax changes the taste of things, but that not everyone seems to think so. Even if I were to notice, as long as it isn't a negative then I wouldn't mind.  
Gochujang caramel cookies... what... Lol. That sounds really interesting.

I wish I would’ve remembered to look up your post bc it would e saved me a lot of hassle and gone with the country crock heavy cream instead. I made this twice this week to Trouble shoot it for today. 

I tried that califia and silk, no luck. Trader Joe’s and country crock were perfectly, the homemade heavy whipping cream from him also works really well. I topped it with chopped hazelnuts and raw cocoa nibs…beautiful AND delicious! I didn’t have any bc I wanted more omnis to taste the amazingness that is vegan food.",

lwf62e0,t3_1go0rdn,1go0rdn,Beautiful frosting!,
lwgktpt,t3_1go0rdn,1go0rdn,"Thanks for the kind words everyone! For those requesting a recipe:

Credit to u/nuggetsattack, I've been using this cake recipe as my baseline vanilla cake for years now: https://www.reddit.com/r/VeganBaking/s/4e7SvA5BI3

To the batter, I added toasted hazelnut pieces, orange zest, and warming spices.

The frosting is vanilla ermine with coconut milk, with hazelnut praline paste blended in. The darker frosting (which I also used for the filling) has a higher concentration of paste.

Honestly though, something was missing. I wanted to avoid chocolate (only because the last cake I made was chocolate), but a layer of mousse would have been wonderful. Or some dried fruits in the cake. Something to add moisture - it was a bit dry in the mouth with all the nuts. Luckily it was a low-pressure birthday party and everyone still enjoyed it.

I can't figure out how to add a picture in a comment to show the inside, but it was nothing special. Just a two-layer nutty cake with the filling described above.",

lwluxxq,t1_lwgktpt,1go0rdn,Do you have the ratio or measurements for the frosting?  I haven't made am ermine with coconut milk yet so that'd helpful.,
lwkbqt5,t1_lwjux5n,1go0rdn,I used a contoured cake scraper for the sides! I feel guilty that people are thinking I could achieve that evenness with piping lol. There's no way.,
lwmoq9f,t1_lwluxxq,1go0rdn,"Sure! Here's the recipe I use. I actually use the same ratio for any liquid (have used soy milk, oat milk, fresh squeezed fruit juice, and combinations of these liquids). Coconut milk just yields a slightly thicker and richer frosting.

35 grams flour

1 cup coconut milk

130 grams granulated sugar (can adjust this - it comes out not-super-sweet with this much sugar)

1 teaspoon vanilla extract

Pinch of salt

1 cup/ 230 grams vegan butter, softened (for a more stable frosting, use a 50/50 mixture of shortening and vegan butter)

Add flour to saucepan. Slowly whisk in milk, then add sugar. Over medium heat, bring to a simmer, whisking constantly, until it becomes very thick and almost pudding-like (maybe five minutes). Take care to scrape the bottom of the pan as you whisk to avoid burning.

Remove from heat, whisk in vanilla and salt. Pour into a bowl to allow it to cool completely. Put plastic wrap on the surface to keep a skin from forming. Chill overnight or for several hours (don't try to cheat this step! Needs to be solidly cold all the way through).

Use a mixer to beat the butter, scraping the sides of the bowl occasionally, about 5 minutes, until pale and fluffy. With the mixer on medium, add the cooled flour mixture a small scoop at a time. Continue to beat until the frosting becomes light and fluffy.

Edit: fixed some steps I missed/messed up.",

lxr7u4q,t1_lxr4v1f,1gtu6ee,"Thank you!

The key to getting the colors right for the grey and the pink batter was using white food coloring first.  Yep, that's a thing!  

I used a gel kind for the white because that's all I could find and was really surprised with the result.  It completely or mostly removes the yellow tinge of the batter so the final color is brighter.  Then I used liposoluble powder food coloring.  I bought red, yellow, black and blue.  You need the tiniest amount to get vibrant colors.  Just make sure you stir it in very well otherwise you'll get streaks of undissolved powder.

Just add a little bit of powder food coloring at a time, like less than 1/4 of a pinch of salt - if that counts as measuring unit - into a couple tablespoons of batter, even less than that for the grey, stir well, double check with your reference image, adjust until you're satisfied.",

It’s simple, but I think you’ll enjoy it (and it’s basic enough that you can tweak it until you get your desired end result).

lo12kwe,t1_lo0dz9h,1fkhrgk,Awesome!!!  I will definitely try this recipe 😊,😊
lo0capw,t1_lnyu15s,1fkhrgk,"I understand!  What I usually do is I put two scoops of dough, for “test cookies,” in the freezer. I will clean up any baking-related messes and, then, I bake off those two cookies that got a little micro-chill, so to speak. That enables me to, potentially, enjoy two [giant] cookies. I usually start by lying to myself and saying something like, “I’ll just have a quarter of one.”  Regardless, that leaves the second cookie available for me to eat at a later time that night— when I will, most likely, run downstairs, for more, like the little goblin that I am. Or, I can scarf it down, in the morning.. as part of a “complete” breakfast, of course. 

The key is to make them right before bed. That way, you get your warm-cookie night cap.  Then, you can let the dough, that you didn’t bake off, get a several-hour chill, while you sleep. 

This is, pretty much, the only way I’m capable of chilling the dough for longer periods of time. I need to have at least a couple of cookies available for immediate consumption!  Anyway, this “method” could work for you, too :)",

lkfk3s4,t3_1bsrxxh,1bsrxxh,Such a beautiful crumb coat!,
kxhui5p,t1_kxhpkh8,1bsrxxh,"Thank you! I used Tofutti cream cheese. It’s the only brand I’ve ever used so I’m not sure how it compares to others, but so far it has worked well for everything! 

The minimalist frosting was a last second choice because I was afraid the frosting would be too rich, but it definitely could have used more! I do like the way it looks though, so I think next time I would just add more frosting to the middle and top of the cake. Also, for the carrot and border, I had to add a lot more confectioners sugar to make it stable enough to pipe and hold shape. 

As for storage—I stored it overnight (about 7 hours) in the freezer after layering and frosting and added the carrot and border this morning while it was still cold. I brought it to a family gathering where it sat in a pretty warm kitchen for about 2 hours before serving and it all held up very well.


Definitely add this to your list! I am still getting text messages from my family (all non-vegans) saying it was the best carrot cake they’ve ever had!",
kxm8a3t,t1_kxl6mli,1bsrxxh,"Hi! So, I’m not a professional by any means, so I’m sure this isn’t the right way, but I always do a crumb coat first, freeze or chill in the fridge (buttercream firms up a lot quicker than this cream cheese frosting so I usually just use the refrigerator for that), then while the cake is still very cold, I do my final layer of frosting and use a metal bench scraper to go along the sides and the top several times. 

When it’s almost to a point that I’m happy with, I take a small offset spatula and carefully smooth out the edges. 

For buttercream that is really frozen, I will dip the scraper in hot water, dry it off, and do the same and it works very well!",
kxla204,t1_kxi2b89,1bsrxxh,"Out of curiosity, did you squeeze every possible drip of carrot liquid out of the carrots before mixing into the batter? 

My husband’s favorite cake is carrot cake, but he cannot have dairy so I was on a quest for the perfect carrot cake recipe. Fail after fail, I finally found one recipe that said to squeeze all of the liquid from the carrots. 
PERFECTION! 

I used Nora’s recipe last year and added the step of squeezing the carrot juice & same, perfect results! I’ll never turn back, even if a recipe doesn’t call for it. ",
kxunqw9,t1_kxuhz7w,1bsrxxh,"Hi! Yes I used applesauce! I followed this one *almost* exactly to the letter. I did use soy milk instead of almond milk, vegetable oil instead of canola oil, and I believe I was about 20 grams short on the carrots, but I went for it anyway lol. 

I did look up the “proper” way to grate and prep the carrots. I was so worried that there would be too much moisture from the carrots as she didn’t mention anything about patting them dry or anything, but from what I gathered, the moisture from the carrots is an important part so I just grated them and left them alone!

Can I ask what went wrong? I’m not an expert baker by any means, but I am an avid troubleshooter haha.",
kxhyrcr,t1_kxhui5p,1bsrxxh,"Oh, thank you for the information! I’ll give it a try.",
kxodwi8,t1_kxm8a3t,1bsrxxh,"Thanks for this! I made the same recipe on Sunday and while mine looked pretty good (I don’t do fancy decorations on top just frosted), yours looks fresh from the bakery!",
kxla80p,t1_kxla204,1bsrxxh,I didn’t squeeze any out! Maybe that was my issue. I can’t even recall if the recipe told me to but I was multitasking so I could have overlooked that.,
kxv8dow,t1_kxunqw9,1bsrxxh,"So I used a pineapple puree instead of the apple sauce, oat milk instead of almond. It deflated quite a bit when removing from the oven, more so than other cakes I've baked. And it was also pretty dense and 'gummy', I think it was cooked though as it was in there for 45 minutes. Some people complained of it being too moist, so maybe that was the issue?

And yeah saw about the carrots, I've never strained carrots for carrot cake before *but* I also saw some comments saying that when grating them in a food processor they may retain more water.

**To try next time:**

- wring carrots to remove excess moisture (I do not have a manual grater, just the ones that comes with the food processor)

- bake it proper oven and not air fryer (my air fryer has a bake function which I've used several times but never for cakes, only croissants, cookies etc)

Let me know if you have any other suggestions!",
ky0nuqq,t1_kxv8dow,1bsrxxh,"Oh, and could you tell me if your batter came out quite thick? almost like a brownie batter...",
ky57so5,t1_ky0nuqq,1bsrxxh,"Me again, haha, just wanted to update that I tried this again and it came out very nicely! It was a bit denser than some other carrot cakes I have made in the past, but maybe that was because this didn't have any eggs?

kw86dr3,t3_1blml5e,1blml5e,"I'm a pastry chef. Earth balance is the worst for pastry applications. As others have said, violife is going to be the best you can buy in a grocery store. I'm not sure what recipes you're working with but you really want the temp of the dough and the butter you're working at to be in the low 60's so the butter doesn't melt but is warm enough to stretch with the dough so it doesn't break. The violife better provides a little butter leeway, and the faba bean protein allows a little more stretch and will hold the butter together at higher temps for longer. 

Miyokos is going to be your next best bet after violife, but it's more brittle, and you have a smaller workable window on the temp.

I’m in the U.S. and currently I don’t have this vegan butter option at my grocery stores. My local Publix JUST started carrying Miyokos! I will have to give it a try. 

Whenever I’ve tried vegan croissants (I’ve only ever tried with earth balance), it turns into this weird slop before everything will get incorporated. Idk how to fully explain it via text, but I don’t have the same issue when baking them “regular.” I attempted another batch for Thanksgiving and idk what went wrong, but the butter seeped out all over the pan when proofing. It was like a swimming pool of butter! 
I used Clair Saffitz recipe & just (attempt) to convert it with vegan replacements. So it’s a “reputable” recipe.

Ingredients
Wet ingredients:
6 ounces silken tofu (1/2 package)
1/4 cup canola oil
1 cup non-dairy milk
1 cup granulated sugar
zest from 1 lemon
2 tablespoons fresh lemon juice
1 teaspoon vanilla extract
Dry ingredients:
2 cups all purpose flour
1/2 teaspoon salt
2 teaspoons baking powder
1/4 teaspoon baking soda
Lemon glaze:
1 cup powdered sugar
1 tablespoon non-dairy milk
1 tablespoon fresh lemon juice
Instructions
Preheat oven to 350 degrees F and lightly grease a standard loaf pan.
Blend all of the wet ingredients in a blender until smooth.
In a large bowl, whisk together all the dry ingredients. Now pour the wet mixture into the dry and mix with a large spoon until just combined. Do not over mix. 
Pour into the prepared pan and bake for 35-45 minutes, until golden brown and a toothpick inserted comes out clean. Let the loaf cool in the pan for 10 minutes, then move to a cooling rack.
While the loaf cools, add the icing ingredients to a medium sized bowl and whisk until smooth. Once the loaf is cooled, drizzle or pour the glaze on top of the loaf. Let the glaze harden, if desired, before slicing and serving.",
kwic0co,t3_1bnhipf,1bnhipf,"Sometimes I've had cakes collapse if I've opened the oven to check on them/test for doneness  and I would have been better off just letting them bake for a few minutes longer without opening the oven and poking them with toothpicks.

This has been really frustrating because how do you know it needs to bake a bit longer if you don't check it? But I do think the opening the oven and inserting the toothpicks may have contributed to the collapsing.  Later iterations baked longer without that type of interrupting worked out fine (vanilla layer cake for me).",

ltad10m,t3_1ga0goz,1ga0goz,"For vegan cookies I have had better success when I chill the dough for longer (like an hour+), have you tried that?",
ltahaoz,t3_1ga0goz,1ga0goz,"I stopped using earth balance a while ago. I had noticed all of the same problems you mentioned, now I’m using Violife butter. Haven’t had any problems since switching!",
lta8r6y,t3_1ga0goz,1ga0goz,I would suspect the company changed their formula. Maybe switching the types of oils that they use.,
ltcakdv,t3_1ga0goz,1ga0goz,"What kind of cookies? What’s the sugar you’re using? I cook in the subtropics so if I have a recipe with brown sugar, I’ll sub in some white to stop the spread.

I agree chilling also helps.

If it’s really hot/humid or if the cookies are really spreading anyways, I switch to shortening. You get higher/puffy cookies that way, but that’s okay.",
ltafjv7,t3_1ga0goz,1ga0goz,"Is it possible that you were measuring your flour wrong all along and only corrected it when you started weighing? If you’ve tried different vegan butter brands and this isn’t isolated to just 1 brand (earth balance) then it’s either something wrong with the recipe or with the preparation of the recipe.

Is it just one particular recipe this is happening with or multiple recipes? Is it a recipe from a website? (They sometimes update their recipes) It could also just be a bad recipe. I hope you can figure it out.",
lta9voh,t3_1ga0goz,1ga0goz,"I wonder if Earth Balance changed their formula around the time you started experiencing problems. Try another brand and see if the problem persists. I personally like the Trader Joe's vegan butter blocks, followed by Country Crock plant butter sticks. 


The other possibility is that the dough is too warm. Try putting the dough balls in the fridge or freezer to harden them up before baking. This will help them stop spreading. ",
lte8wmm,t3_1ga0goz,1ga0goz,"Moisture can definitely affect your flour in a way that weighing it wouldn't necessarily fix, but it doesn't SEEM like that's the problem you're having.  I agree chilling is always a good idea, but you really shouldn't NEED to to prevent the problems you're having.  Anything else different?  New apartment/house/kitchen/oven/HVAC/cookieScoop/religion?",
ltaso8c,t1_ltad10m,1ga0goz,highly recommend chilling overnight. the flavors really develop!,
ltam0cx,t1_ltad10m,1ga0goz,"I have tried chilling it, but never for quite that long. I will give it a go. Thank you!",
ltaifz3,t1_ltahaoz,1ga0goz,"I second everything you said! When I was still using Earth balance I decreased it by a few tablespoons and that seem to help, but now I just use violife and I think it works better.",
ltamo3l,t1_ltahaoz,1ga0goz,"Thank you. I have tried several vegan butters, but violife isn't one, so I will give it a try!",
ltdizpr,t1_ltahaoz,1ga0goz,"I used Violife for the first time this weekend for a batch of pumpkin snickerdoodles for a party. I was a little bit time crunched, so I softened it in the microwave which resulted in more melted butter than I wanted, but they came out great. One person said it was like eating a pillow, but in a good way. 

I’ve used Nucoa, Imperial, Miyoko’s, Earth Balance and now Violife. I always use sticks and never tub. Try chilling as another commenter said, but don’t be afraid to add more dry ingredient. Maybe add just a quarter cup to start and mix it in well and see how stiff your dough gets. Alternatively, you could try mixing it for longer to develop more of the gluten in the flour to get your desired consistency.",
ltalyvr,t1_lta8r6y,1ga0goz,Thanks! I am wondering about that too. I  have tried a variety of different butters and still struggling to get results.,
ltdi0rg,t1_ltcakdv,1ga0goz,Its happened with Snickerdoodles and chocolate chip. Both granulated cane sugar and brown sugar. Last night it was white and brown sugar mixed.,
ltamlyz,t1_ltafjv7,1ga0goz,"Thanks. Its several recipes, almost entirely from cookbooks (Joy of Cooking). The cookies went off the rails before I started weighing. Thats only a recent development (out of desperation). Its a bit perplexing since they were consistently good, until they weren't and now no matter what I do they aren't great.",
ltam730,t1_lta9voh,1ga0goz,"Thank you! I have tried TJ and Country Crock hoping it would resolve things, but to no avail unfortunately. I will try chilling!",
lteypqz,t1_lte8wmm,1ga0goz,"Honestly, very little has changed. Seemed to have just sort of happened. Other baked goods like scones seem to come out well. This whole experience is making me consider changing my religion. I need a new baking god to worship. I think maybe I am going to play with reducing the butter amounts and see what happens.",
ltc6wqk,t1_ltaso8c,1ga0goz,"I totally agree! I always chill mine for 48 hours to develop a little ""funk"" and have been told several times that they're the best chocolate chip cookies the person has ever had. Followed by their shock that the cookies are vegan",
ltamq8q,t1_ltaifz3,1ga0goz,Thanks! I am going to try violife and possibly try reducing the Earthbalance to see if that gets a better cookie!,
ltdr466,t1_ltdi0rg,1ga0goz,"Frustrating. I’d try shortening and work backwards from there. You won’t get the buttery notes obviously but it’ll at least indicate if it’s something about the Earth Balance.

I’ve only ever baked with country crock, coconut oil, shortening as earth balance is more $$ (I get the oil wholesale), so I’m not sure if their blend changed.",
ltf866g,t1_lteypqz,1ga0goz,Sure worth it go. Are these recipes you're having trouble with all butter? Or are they already mixed with shortening in some of them?,
ltbul3n,t1_ltamq8q,1ga0goz,Country Crock Plant Butter is also great. It's available at Walmart and the most affordable vegan butter I've found.,
ltdr7do,t1_ltdr466,1ga0goz,"Frustrating. I’d try shortening and work backwards from there. You won’t get the buttery notes obviously but it’ll at least indicate if it’s something about the Earth Balance.

I’ve only ever baked with country crock, coconut oil, shortening as earth balance is more $$ (I get the oil wholesale), so I’m not sure if their blend changed.

I’ve also had some luck stopping spread by broiling the tops for a couple minutes, then finishing the rest on the regular temperature.",
ltcinmn,t1_ltbul3n,1ga0goz,I purchase butter from distributors so I get it a lot cheaper and the violife I get is still not as cheap as the Walmart CC Plant Butter.  So we use CC for everything except our buttercream.  Works perfectly.,
ltcyry9,t1_ltcinmn,1ga0goz,"Violife is so expensive. I got a ton of it from a dollar store for $1.99, which is still the same price as CC because it's only a cup (compared to 2 cups with the CC sticks). I miss CC only being $2.99. Do you use Violife for buttercream? I've never had issues with CC, but I've never made them side by side to compare.",
ltd0i0i,t1_ltcyry9,1ga0goz,Yeah we had several customers complain about the mouth feel and the flavor of our buttercream from the CC butter so we went with Violife and not only did customers love it the palm oil made it much more stable in warmer temps,

ltx2vcn,t1_ltwm4qg,1gctqs2,"https://thegreatbritishbakeoff.co.uk/recipes/all/prue-leith-vegan-tropical-pavlova/

This was the recipe I used (just for the meringue) but I didn’t have any cream of tartar so I used lemon juice instead (I think I might have done a full tsp of lemon juice, I think you have to double the quantity for subbing cream of tartar) 

Then the whipped cream is oatlys whippable cream which is amazing !!! Best vegan cream ever, and I added powdered sugar till I was happy with it.",
ltx3v2z,t1_ltwm4if,1gctqs2,Yes!:),
ltwtklu,t1_ltwp9nc,1gctqs2,"You can use stuff that has similar proteins to egg whites (specifically Ovalbumin), for example most people use the water from can of chickpeas called aqufaba, or from cooking chickpeas yourself, look up recipes online for how to make aqufaba and aquafaba merengue 


But i cook a lot and I dont want piles of chickpeas and it's not that great in sponge cakes so i use potato protein, in every 100g water dissolve 3g potato protein and you can use it as egg whites",
ltx4eks,t1_ltwp9nc,1gctqs2,"Aquafaba! It’s a surprisingly good sub for eggs when making meringues, pretty much use it the exact same way you’d make normal meringue but with some xanthum gum for stability",
ltx44i0,t1_ltwpfaz,1gctqs2,"So I would say it’s a little more fragile than regular meringue and maybe that chewiness on the inside isn’t exactly the same, but as a pavlova it’s pretty much exactly the same. I think you’d only notice differences if you ate the meringue on its own.

I also think you might not notice those differences as much if you bake a smaller version - like meringue kisses.",

lqdsgbz,t3_1fwddby,1fwddby,"Apple Cake

INGREDIENTS

3 cups all-purpose flour
1 teaspoon baking soda
¼ teaspoon salt
1 teaspoon cinnamon
3 egg replacement
6 tablespoons water
1½ cups granulated sugar
1¼ canola oil
2 teaspoons vanilla extract
3 cups peeled and chopped apples
1 recipe brown sugar super

STEPS

1) Preheat the over to 350°. Lightly oil a bundt pan.

Sift together the flour, baking soda, salt, and cinnamon. Seat aside. In a food processor or blender, whip the egg replacer and water together until it becomes creamy, about 1 minute. Add the sugar, oil, and vanilla, and beat for 2 minutes. Stir the dry ingredients into the wet. Fold the apples. You will have a thick batter.

Pour the batter into the pan, bake for 1 hour and 15 minutes. Pour the syrup over the cake as soon as it comes out of the over. Let the cake cool, loosen the sides, invert onto a place, then invert onto another plate, with the syrup topping side up.",

kwlhjjc,t3_1bnyb2u,1bnyb2u,How ripe were your bananas? I believe they should be almost inedible levels of ripeness.,
kwln50l,t3_1bnyb2u,1bnyb2u,"Very very brown and  ripe bananas 

And if you need more flavoring or cannot use ripe bananas I’ve used banana extract / flavoring before in a banana split cupcake and it enhanced the flavor beautifully",
kwn6oua,t3_1bnyb2u,1bnyb2u,"I let my bananas go very brown, and then I freeze them for a month. Almond extract helped me get more flavor.  Vanilla is a great staple, but I've found it gets lost in a lot of my cooking because it's in so many recipes.",
kwochnz,t3_1bnyb2u,1bnyb2u,"The grosser the bananas the better the bread, as other commenters have touched on. Like so ripe that you can squeeze them out of the peel lol. When I worked at a bakery we'd peel boxes of them at a time and rarely were they too mushy to use. Mold or pure rot does happen. 

Basically they're a starch and in the ripening process that turns into sugar which increases the sweetness/flavor.

Edit: after seeing the recipe they do give the step of mixing sugars with bananas first. If you have a stand mixer put them in with a paddle attachment on low-mid speed for a while before adding the fats and proteins.",
kwlpont,t3_1bnyb2u,1bnyb2u,"You could add a banana liqueur or like the baking aisle should also have a banana extract to the cake itself. Alternatively, make a simple glaze or frosting for the top of the bread with some of the liqueur or extract.",

kwnirpe,t1_kwlkybh,1bnyb2u,placing the bananas in the fridge actually stunts their riping! the cold just turns the skins extra brown but they don’t actually ripen in there— i recommend riping them near a window for a couple days for maximum flavor,
kwm0mx2,t1_kwlkybh,1bnyb2u,I’m not actually the best to ask as I’m allergic to bananas! I usually substitute puréed roast sweet potato.,
kx1ztae,t1_kx1sp86,1bnyb2u,"For sure, even a big spatula would be good to mush it all together. A stand mixer paddle is just a convenience to let it go while you do something else.",
kx2vuct,t1_kx1ss6w,1bnyb2u,Alton Brown uses it in his banana pudding recipe to add more banana flavor. I thought it might be useful to do something similar in your recipe.,
kx1saee,t1_kwm0mx2,1bnyb2u,oh wow do you make sweet potato bread? sounds good!!,

lxy5khh,t3_1gv0u29,1gv0u29,"Can I ask why you want to?

The recipe doesn't look like it would need it. The raising agents will give it lift and the oil will help give it body & moisture like an egg might. You could probably add a flax/chia egg, but it would most likely just make it slightly denser. What are you hoping a flax egg would do for the cake?",

lxz0ubs,t3_1gv0u29,1gv0u29,"I would not recommend it. Baking is precise chemistry, and that recipe already accounts for adequate levels of moisture and rising agents. Unless you understand the chemistry of every ingredient really well, by altering the recipe you risk messing it up.",

lxzddsw,t3_1gv0u29,1gv0u29,"I think some folks are being a little TOO precious about the recipe.  Vegan cakes, even when moist, tender, delicious, and all that often DO have a tendency to be a little too brittle or crumbly.  I bet pre-hydrating/gelatinizing the flour with boiling hot water will help this cake out in that regard (as its written).  SO despite how I started, I agree with the prevailing wisdom to give this a go as is.  But I would for sure have a mind on adding something else to help hold things together if I thought it needed that in the future.  I haven't used chia in cakes much myself, so I'd be more likely to try mashed unripe banana or xanthan gum, but ¯\\\_(ツ)\_/¯",

ly0eall,t1_lxzddsw,1gv0u29,"I second adding xanthan gum to this recipe.  
This recipe's ratio of liquid ingredients to dry ingredients is going to leave this cake with a short shelf life as the liquid will evaporate rather quickly.  If they are eating it in a day it will most likely not be noticeable but 2 days or 3 and they'll notice a very dry crumbling cake. 
The xanthan gum will do wonders for locking in the moisture to the cake.",

You shouldn't need to add anything :) Try making it the way the recipe says and then you can compare it to other recipes you've tried before and see which one you like best!

\- make recipe as close as can

\- i like the recipe perfectly? great, keep as is. 

\- i want to change something about the result? google something like ""my cake is too dry, how fix""

\- note advice and tips

\- mess around with changes till i get tired of the recipe, or im satisfied :>

you could also just find an alternative recipe :P sticking to recipes with reviews helps too, as reviewers will sometimes recommend things (i.e. add 1/4 c less oil). and if you mess up a recipe, ah well, welcome to the wonderful world of baking, we've all messed up :D",

It's a little scary but I think the best thing to do is to commit to this recipe if you want to try it, and follow it exactly without any flax/chia paste for now. For what it's worth, I have made many vegan cakes without flax/chia and they came out great! I think this is a good recipe the way it's written.",

Take thick plastic foil, cut it into 4x10cm and tempered chocolat, you dip the tip of a knife (with a pointy end) into the chocolat and put it onto the foils corner. Make sure to apply some pressure while pulling the knife towards you.
Next you'll need a baking sheet or something you can let your leafs harden in. I used two metal bars, close together.
Once your chocolate leafs are hardened, you can pick them up and arrange them how ever you like :)

I also like school night vegan's baking recipes, though I'm not sure I've made any cookies from him yet. 

I've had great luck with just substituting for vegan options. I use soy milk for most baking (especially for things with buttermilk), but sometimes oat milk. And then vegan butter–usually earth balance is recommended for baking but others work, and I sometimes use country crock. And for egg in recipes, I really prefer egg replacer–bob's red mill or ener-g, but you can use cornstarch or flax seeds as well. It does add a bit of flax flavor that I notice in cookies.

I think I have the opposite experience of a lot of others–a lot of vegan recipes turn out badly, but converting trusted recipes almost always works. I usually measure in grams or convert recipes to weight so I can be exact in my modifications if it doesn't turn out. 

I also really like Anzac biscuits, just using the bon appetit recipe and vegan butter. It does require golden syrup though, which I made instead of trying to buy somewhere. It's coconut and oat and delicious if you like that combo!",

-Use Granny smith apples to balance sweet with tart. 

-Add some lemon squeezes to apple sugar cinnamon mixture to brighten apple flavor. 

-Add little pads of (vegan) butter cubes on top of apple layer before baking.

-When adding water to the dough have it in freezer while you prep or you can pull water from a container that has ice in it.
 
-Refrain from touching the dough with your hands as much as possible. 

-If dough gets too warm during prep, then put back in freezer for a little bit. 

-Splash a little water on the counter before putting down the bottom saran wrap so it sticks to surface.

-Roll out between 2 saran wrap sheets. Remove top saran, flip onto top of pie pan and gently nudge into pan before taking 2nd saran off.

-To prevent burning crust put tin foil over whole pie or just the crust halfway through baking.

m2x7ulg,t3_1hi92bi,1hi92bi,Try adding chopped chocolate maybe the chips are too small to bake and get goey.,
m2x9dkb,t3_1hi92bi,1hi92bi,"Do you weigh or scoop your flour? These look like they have too much flour, also add 1.5-2x as many cc as the recipe calls for 👌 totally take out before they get this cooked! They’ll finish cooking up on the pan a bit but you do want them coming out of the oven a little underdone to maintain ultimate gooeyness",👌
m2xq7gm,t3_1hi92bi,1hi92bi,Add a piece of chopped chocolate onto each cookie before it goes into the oven and only mix your chips in right before the flour is fully incorporated,
m30hmpy,t3_1hi92bi,1hi92bi,I feel like the recipe is a bit disingenuous when compared to the photos because she's adding massive chunks of chocolate that are going to melt into puddles of gooey chocolate and you're not going to accomplish that with just chocolate chips.,
m32rlfc,t3_1hi92bi,1hi92bi,"My immediate thought is to wonder if the recipe you're using is from the United States?

If so, the recipe might call for the flour to be measured by volume rather than weight, and this is a poor method of measurement because the same amount of flour can have different levels of density depending on multiple factors (e.g. how you scoop it, how it's stored, the temperature and humidity in the air, how much it settled in transit, etc.) 

Looking at your cookies, it seems to me that they have a higher proportion of flour which is why they appear dryer and less ""gooey"" compared to the ones in the photo.

Additionally, the cookies in their photo contain chocolate shards, not chocolate chips. Chocolate chips are specially designed to hold their shape even during baking, so you won't get the ""puddles"" of chocolate by using chocolate chips.",
m36534w,t3_1hi92bi,1hi92bi,"I’ve been on a cookie journey too. Here’s a couple tips I picked up that helped - If your recipe doesn’t call for cornstarch, remove a couple tablespoons of flour and replace with cornstarch. Also mind your ratio of brown sugar to granulated sugar- brown sugar makes cookies chewy, granulated makes them crispy.",
m2ztp7u,t3_1hi92bi,1hi92bi,What recipe is this? I’ve been trying to make good vegan chocolate chip cookies for years and they always turn out flat and crispy.  These look amazing.,
m2x7nr1,t3_1hi92bi,1hi92bi,Try cooking them for a little less time. Sometimes the chocolate chips basically dry out if they're cooked too long,
m2z25r6,t3_1hi92bi,1hi92bi,"Not saying this is what happened with yours, but I don't think I've been able to make a chocolate chip cookie that isn't more bread-like than cookie. I've kind of given up on making them.",
m2zq97v,t3_1hi92bi,1hi92bi,"The temperature of the butter makes a difference, apparently.",
m2x9969,t1_m2x7ulg,1hi92bi,I never thought about that making a difference I will try that next time!,
m2x9ryn,t1_m2x9dkb,1hi92bi,"I scoop my flour. I have a scale so I will definitely try weighing next time instead, and I will definitely add way more chocolate.",
m2zeyvc,t1_m2xq7gm,1hi92bi,This! Adding chocolate to the top is going to make it look more like the pictures you see. Chilling you dough will allow the flour and butter to hang out and better idk how to explain it but you’ll have an almost fudgier chewier cookie.,
m33rbwm,t1_m32rlfc,1hi92bi,Idk why I never thought chocolate chunks would really make that much of a difference when it came to these!! And also I will definitely weigh the flour next time I,
m365csu,t1_m36534w,1hi92bi,"And also, the last recipe I used told me to drop the sheet on the counter a couple times after taking them out of the oven, to help them deflate, and I think it helped",
m2x9b6r,t1_m2x7nr1,1hi92bi,I did one batch for more time and then one batch for less time and neither of them flattened out lol,
m2xjkn6,t1_m2x9969,1hi92bi,"In the photo notes, the recipe author says that she uses chocolate chips AND chopped bar chocolate, but she did not include chopped bar chocolate in the recipe itself. I always use chopped bars and it results in generous chocolate puddles. Good luck!",
m2x9tp4,t1_m2x9969,1hi92bi,I usually use chopped up Lindt dark choc and it goes super gooey and melty :) but I've tried several different kinds of chocolate blocks with similar results. I very rarely use choc chips!,
m2xao50,t1_m2x9ryn,1hi92bi,Weighing flour is a game changer for consistency and helps get your foot in the bread game 😏,😏
m2y8j4p,t1_m2x9ryn,1hi92bi,Weighing is key. Throw your scoops away…lol,
m368nze,t1_m365csu,1hi92bi,That recipe did call for cornstarch and brown sugar!! But I’m definitely gonna try dropping the sheet next time thank you!!,
m2xa7kj,t1_m2x9b6r,1hi92bi,"Hmmm.. you might also try weighing out the flour. Sometimes, they stay puffier if there's too much flour. Also, if you over mix, you can add in more air, which would make them more puffy. There's also a chance the recipe creator just underbaked them and smacked them with a spatula to make it look extra gooey for a good picture lol",

kicez3v,t3_1997hrl,1997hrl,"Try Korean / Japanese recipes, not American ones. 

I’ve found them to be less sweet / contain less sugar.

kicb6p8,t3_1997hrl,1997hrl,"I find recipes by US authors to by typically higher in sugar than those outside the US, though there are plenty of non-US authors guilty of this as well. 

I recently made an egg nog recipe out of a cookbook and it was extremely sweet from dates alone. I made it again but (like you) with half the dates and it was still plenty sweet.

I wanted to use up some pears and almost made this recipe: [https://www.bbcgoodfood.com/recipes/sticky-toffee-pear-pudding](https://www.bbcgoodfood.com/recipes/sticky-toffee-pear-pudding) before noticing the sugar content: 75g sugar *per person*. And they suggest eating it with ice cream...",
kiccyq2,t3_1997hrl,1997hrl,"Are you in the US by chance? The amount of sugar normalized in US desserts, in my experience, is WAY more than a lot of other countries. It’s kind of disgusting to think about.",
kics1oh,t3_1997hrl,1997hrl,"I do most of my baking without added sugar other than a little bit of molasses or maple syrup. I like to use fruit like apple sauce or blended dates for sweetness instead and also go heavy on flavors like cinnamon, ginger, or chocolate to give things more depth.",
kic5q14,t3_1997hrl,1997hrl,"Agree! I think a lot of people are adamant that it's necessary for the chemistry of the baking process (Karolina Tegelaar certainly is in The Vegan Baking Bible) but I think this is over-stated. I have made occasional vegan cakes from blogs that were sugar free and sweetened only with fruit. Personally thought they were under-spiced, and haven't made a version I'd be satisfied to recommend, even if I would eat them myself, but they did fundamentally work as cakes - they didn't sink or crumble.  

 Hoping that this thread will attract some links to good recipes people have tried. 

 I have successfully reduced sugar in cakes that use a lot of fruit and veg in the ingredients, but not eliminated it all together. I don't generally like to make things that stick to my teeth a lot like biscuits (cookies) and meringues anyway, so it's the general point of baking without (much) sugar that interests me rather than replicating every type of dish",
kq1qfn8,t3_1997hrl,1997hrl,I wonder if the people writing these recipes actually put that much sugar when the bake for themselves...,
kicy30k,t3_1997hrl,1997hrl,"I almost always reduce the amount of sugar in recipe.  There is one recipe I love and have adapted that had the sweetest icing.  It was so tasty but made my teeth hurt.  After some testing I ended up going from 3 cups of sugar to 2 cups.   Even then it's sweet, but not ""hurt your teeth"" sweet.",
kid7yn9,t3_1997hrl,1997hrl,"I don’t have any real suggestions to why this is other than anecdotal observations of US recipes being sweeter overall, but I did make this cake recently and really enjoyed the fact that it was less sweet. One cup of sugar sounds like a lot, but it’s a big unfrosted sheet cake. 

https://www.dimitrasdishes.com/vegan-cinnamon-raisin-cake-from-kalamata/",
kie8yj5,t3_1997hrl,1997hrl,"yes, and it’s especially annoying when reducing sugar ruins how the recipe functions (like becomes cakey or something) or makes it too alkaline. I like to look for old recipes and update them because they’re almost always way less sweet, but it’s hard and takes trial and error to replace eggs that serve multiple functions in a recipe and they usually do.",
kicfymc,t3_1997hrl,1997hrl,"I totally agree, its gross! I'm in the US BTW.  I've been veg (eating dairy and eggs) for many years and lately have been leaning into vegan, including baking for some vegan friends.

I'm a pretty experienced cook throughout my life and I think the over the top sweetness has something to do with a lack of balance in the tastes. For example, I can make egg replacers that function pretty well, but they don't provide the satisfaction that a little protein provides. I have been experimenting with adding some pumpkin protein powder with a lot of success.  I also think coconut oil and sugar do not taste well together, its like oily sugar. Its hard finding a replacement for butter that balances the sweetness.  And of course cutting WAY back on the sugar most of the time.

another thing is that sugar helps keep things moist and from going stale because its hygroscopic.  I think so many recipe developers err on the side of way too sticky sweet. But I'm a person who prefers cake over candy any day, I guess everyone has their preference.

My BF is type 1 diabetic, and i often use the KA sugar replacer with no problems in the finished product.  Also, I use almond flour a lot and the extra fat (calories!) helps keep things moist with less sugar.

LOL, lucky me gets to make keto vegan desserts!",
kim77vz,t3_1997hrl,1997hrl,"Agreed. I use apple cider (have thought of making it into a syrup), maple syrup, or date syrup to sweeten.",

Like when I followed a pizza dough recipe that ended up at like 95% hydration because their ""cups"" of flour are probably like 200 grams rather than 120-125. Or also when they say ""one medium zucchini"" (courgette).

Even two cups of sugar is too much for me. I wish there was a great vegan alternative to whipped cream or just cream in general that could be whipped. I love how they aren’t sweet at all.

kigl9mp,t1_kicfymc,1997hrl,I definitely don’t use coconut oil for this reason. It’s utterly disgusting and I have a sensitivity to it that gives me a major headache when I eat coconut. I just use a good vegan butter instead and they’ve all worked just fine.,

Are they leavening
Are they moistening
Are they a binder adding chewiness and sticking things
Is it adding richness
For flavor

Each of them can have a different  alternative that can be used in combination

For example in muffins where I have some other binder like gl gum or tapioca Starch, I'll just add apple sauce or another puree foe moistneas and extra baking powder for levening

- Rinse the chickpeas in a sieve again.
- Then cook them till the cooking-water will get murky. Best to follow the package instructions. I cook them for 20-30min.
- Catch the chickpeas in a sieve and collect all the murky cooking water.
- Voila you have created aquafaba, vegan egg snow!
- You can make wonderfully nutritious hummus from the chickpeas.

Aquafaba is a magic ingredient in vegan baking. It makes your dough and cream-creations super fluffy.

But it looks like this particular recipe called for oil, not butter, so it's probably not the latter.

The rest of the batch will probably turn out like this when baked, but do they taste okay? If so chalk it up to experience lol, we've all been there. Maybe experiment with baking at different temperatures to see if that makes any difference - if you increase the heat then drop the cooking time, if you lower the heat bake it for longer. Whether you chill the dough first and for how long will also impact how cookies bake/spread/melt, but I can't say whether any of this will actually have an impact with this particular issue.

My gut would say to try letting the next batch reach room temperature (assuming you chilled this batch) and then baking them at a lower temperature for a longer time. I don't know how that would help, exactly, but it's pretty much the only thing you can do differently at this point.",

kiwku3f,t3_19bw3r8,19bw3r8,Recently had this happen with coarse sugar. Try finer or powdered sugar.,
kiwjmvz,t3_19bw3r8,19bw3r8,"A lot of people suggested that your sugar may be too coarse. When I need a finer sugar I just run mine through a coffee grinder. 

Ener-G egg replacer is also my go to for cakes and cookies, it may be worth experimenting with different recipes. I sometimes also use tahini for chocolate chip cookies.",
kiuz9xz,t1_kiuz6iw,19bw3r8,I say that as someone who has used this recipe btw! I did chill my dough but it turned out well the times I've used it,
kivf7kq,t1_kius461,19bw3r8,"Maybe try this one next time: https://www.noracooks.com/vegan-chocolate-chip-cookies/
Done them twice now, they‘re amazing",
kiz3of9,t1_kius461,19bw3r8,CCK is pretty good about responding to comments on the site. I'd leave a note and see if they have any idea what might have gone wrong. I don't think there's anything wrong with the recipe.,
kivzzr2,t1_kius461,19bw3r8,Another worthy mention is [America's test kitchen](https://www.thefullhelping.com/americas-test-kitchen-vegan-chocolate-chip-cookies/). I've made them twice and they [turned out perfect](https://www.reddit.com/r/MediocreVeganFoodPorn/comments/18q8aql/chocolate_chunk_cookies_not_for_santa/) even with some creative liberties taken the second time.,

kuwjvyv,t1_kuwjj8w,19bw3r8,I’m so glad!! I really struggled with chocolate chip cookies (both as omni and vegan) and this recipe is simply the best :),
lpcog8y,t3_1frel76,1frel76,"This looks a bit like ""Maulwurfkuchen"" (hedgehog cake in german). Its basically a chocolate cake layer, one layer banana slices and then topped with vanilla whipped cream to form a pile which is then covered with chocolate cake crumbs to make it look like the piles hedgehogs make when they dig underground. Its super yummy.",
lpdmmww,t3_1frel76,1frel76,"Oooh, fuck me. I'd devour that.",
lpcsdja,t3_1frel76,1frel76,What is the cream made of?,

Lentil protein solution (water, 1.1% lentil flour), vegetable fats 31% (coconut oil, rapeseed oil), sugar, modified corn starch, emulsifiers (sunflower lecithins, sucrose and fatty acid esters, mono- and diglycerides of fatty acids), stabilizers (guar gum, carob flour), natural flavor, salt, dye (carotenes).",

lpguwh7,t1_lpcal3z,1frel76,Absolutely,
lpiub75,t1_lpiu729,1frel76,I see coconut oil as one of the ingredients,
lpiu99y,t1_lpiu729,1frel76,The sunflower plant offers additional benefits besides beauty. Sunflower oil is suggested to possess anti-inflammatory properties.

lpctzml,t1_lpcng42,1frel76,"Oh it's actually not preferences, or at least not preferences that relate to flavour. It's just needed to provide structural integrity if your going to make a 3 tiered+ cake that needs to survive some heat. 

Frosted and layered cakes do take more effort but it's definitely worth it when people just assume ""that cake can't possibly be vegan"" only to realise they have fallen into my meticulously calculated plan. 

Or it's just fun? Honestly at this point I'm not sure.

Tl;dr frosting is also for sealing and stabilising cake, not just flavour.",
lpcvv37,t1_lpctzml,1frel76,"Wow, going up a tier! Congratulations on your cake making skills. You sound most knowledgeable in this area. However, my preference would still be to steer clear of all that frosting, however structural and/or tasty.",

ltjjayg,t1_ltjdp0y,1gb6yhn,"I'm not sure if I'm allowed to link to non-vegan recipes. I got the recipe from ""Sugar Spun Run"" and veganized it. I used Country Crock Plant Butter, Trader Joe's vegan cream cheese, oatmilk + vinegar for the buttermilk, and Bob's egg replacer.",
ltjj6lj,t1_ltjdp0y,1gb6yhn,I second this. Need the recipe!!!,
ltl8kuy,t1_ltjjayg,1gb6yhn,It's actually so helpful to hear your alterations! Baking doesn't always turn out with vegan substitutions so I'm def gonna try this seeing how it turned out for you!,
lv80qxz,t1_ltjjayg,1gb6yhn,"I'm curious, did you just melt the butter or did you try to brown it? I was inspired by your post and made this for my Dad's birthday yesterday (using Ripple + vinegar, Violife cream cheese, and Just egg). Since vegan butter won't brown the same way as cow butter, I tried browning the butter (Country Crock) along with two teaspoons of natural almond butter. It worked really well!",
ltk5g05,t1_ltjjayg,1gb6yhn,Thank you!,
ltltr0v,t1_ltl8kuy,1gb6yhn,I've had a lot of luck doing vegan substitutions in cakes. I always try to find recipes with weight measurements too (more consistency). This was my very first time making butter pecan and I was nervous because I've never added nuts to a batter before. I went back and forth between using applesauce and Bob's. I think either would work. The cake batter was delicious. I'll be making cupcakes next time.,
lv83q60,t1_lv80qxz,1gb6yhn,"I melted it and cooked it on the stove for about 4-5 minutes. I know you can't truly brown vegan butter, but I did this anyway. I tried the almond butter technique once for cookies a few months ago and I really couldn't taste the difference, so I haven't done it again. I'm so glad it turned out well for you! ☺️ I made this again, but in cupcake and Bundt cake form. It's so good!",☺
lv89n0b,t1_lv83q60,1gb6yhn,"Oooh, maybe I'll try it both ways with something less complex and see for myself if I can tell a difference, then-- this was the first time I'd seen brown butter called for in a recipe I was veganizing, so I didn't want to miss out on the flavor. I'd also toasted the nuts which I think can give a similar profile? 

Thanks for answering, and thanks for posting this recipe-- I agree it's super delicious and was a huge hit!",
lv8a9rk,t1_lv89n0b,1gb6yhn,"I didn't even think about toasting the pecans. Now I need to try that!

l5ro53a,t3_1d0png7,1d0png7,"Those look incredible! Thank you for sharing the recipe and the details in it as well!

A question: if I don't have or am unable to find protein powder, what should I use in its place? Or do I skip it entirely if I don't have it?",

l5svdt3,t3_1d0png7,1d0png7,What does CC mean?,
l5opxan,t1_l5opace,1d0png7,Thank you :)!  That means a lot 🥹 I try to use [mostly] proper grammar,🥹
l5r5zgz,t1_l5q4khu,1d0png7,"I’ve come pretty close. 

It’s amazing what the baking soda does as far as giving it that doughy-cookie-dough taste. I saw people using it on Instagram with their edible cookie dough recipes. They were like “baking soda gives it that cookie dough flavor.”  And I was like, “yeah, right.”  

They were, in fact, right 😂",😂
l5pvfyi,t1_l5oq8tf,1d0png7,"Looks delicious, do you think we could make it as a cake, i mean big size ? IF yes, can you write down the recipe for the cake ? hahaa",
l5rzgo7,t1_l5ro53a,1d0png7,"Thank you! :) I think you could probably skip it, entirely, and just add more oat flour and maybe a little less yogurt. I wonder if you could add some almond flour, now that I think of it. I haven’t tried it, in this dish, so I can’t vouch for it, but that could be an option. You’ll see when you make this that you can easily adjust things to your liking. I add the protein powder mostly because I am trying to meet a certain protein goal each day.  There is a tiny bit of protein in the oat flour, however. Like 6g per serving— a serving being 30g. I have added banana to this mix for a slightly different taste, also.  I think this is a pretty forgiving type of dish, one which you can easily customize and not worry too much about “messing it up.”  You’ll just want to be sure to end up with a batter that is rather thick and spreadable. 

If you are trying to meet a protein requirement, and want a treat that is more filling (where the protein powder is pretty much undetectable— I say “pretty much,” because I assume that subtlety depends on the brand and flavor), then I’d highly suggest adding protein powder, when you can :)

I hope this was helpful and sufficiently answered your question!  Sometimes, I just end up confusing people even more :/",

l5y1pqr,t1_l5wjtge,1d0png7,"Hey, sorry, I didn’t forget ya :/.  A couple of things happened. I had a blowout argument with my mother’s fiancé because he yelled at my cat. That might sound silly, but he had my cat cowering under the table. Therefore, I wasn’t able to make the “cake” last night. I’m just avoiding being around this person. But, secondly, whilst sitting in my room, with my cats, avoiding this person, I realized that I probably won’t have enough ingredients to make the larger cake. Like I would have just enough ingredients to make the single cake, but then I wouldn’t be able to make myself any fresh versions after that. Know what I mean?  Anyway, I am going food shopping on June 5th (I go once a month), and I will get enough to make the big one and let you know.

lly2vfu,t1_llwykaj,1fayk5x,They are so quick ... I usually make two batches. They still only last a day though.,
lm0xky2,t1_llya1zk,1fayk5x,Oh those are chocolate ... I should have added that in the recipe. I swapped out two spoons of all purpose flour for two spoons of cocoa powder it makes the dough a bit stiffer though.,
lly37an,t1_llx8an5,1fayk5x,"Yes, I think you can sub all of it with ap you'll have to check th texture though it should be about the same as sugar cookies.",

kzb96da,t3_1c2nbwz,1c2nbwz,I cheat with cream cheese frosting… as in I buy it. Duncan Hines cream cheese frosting is accidentally vegan.

kzc7evc,t3_1c2nbwz,1c2nbwz,The Philly brand is the worst vegan cream cheese I’ve ever had by far! Violife is good,
kzcg4m6,t3_1c2nbwz,1c2nbwz,i use miyoko’s! it’s the only brand i’ve tried that’s sturdy enough for frosting cakes lol i also wasn’t satisfied with philadelphia :(,

kzddkhx,t3_1c2nbwz,1c2nbwz,The only thing I like Violife for is for cream cheese frosting. It makes an excellent tasting frosting even though it doesn’t taste good on its own (to me).,
kzeb0sy,t3_1c2nbwz,1c2nbwz,"I like Kite Hill, though I find I need to add a bit of salt to the finished frosting for it to be properly balanced.",
kzek80o,t3_1c2nbwz,1c2nbwz,"I’ve tried a couple of brands for a cream cheese filling and Kite Hill is by far the best. (I haven’t tried Tofutti myself as I can’t handle soy, so it may be even better.)

kzfoynb,t3_1c2nbwz,1c2nbwz,Tofutti,

kzbp1hv,t1_kzbabms,1c2nbwz,I just made Nora’s and while the flavor was good — used Kite Hill — it was a little soft. I just made a bunch of mini cakes to sell at the market tomorrow. Fingers crossed they don’t melt.,
kze3hnz,t1_kzbpoq7,1c2nbwz,"It’s lowkey hard to make cream cheese frosting that’s vegan and firm enough for a cake, I don’t have any problem when it’s for cinnamon rolls specifically since it doesn’t need to be super firm",

ll6rdsp,t3_1f7drpj,1f7drpj,"They're still good for inspiration. 

Sub out butter for plant based country crock. Veganaise for mayo in old *salad* recipes. Mashed chickpeas work in tuna and chicken salads for example (I'm talking sandwich spread). Try some of the old marinades but with mushrooms or tofu in place of whatever meat. 

Just flip through them and if you can veganize at least half of the recipes- it's worth keeping.",

ll6q2ek,t3_1f7drpj,1f7drpj,"I love cookbooks and keep some nonvegan ones. They can be great inspiration if you’re good at veganizing dishes and enjoy doing it.

I find that omni cookbooks that are intended to be on cooking basics to be less useful than their vegan counterparts though. The Baking Bible might not tell you about aquafaba meringue but the Vegan Baking Bible will.",
ll6us97,t3_1f7drpj,1f7drpj,I have made a lot of stuff from JOC and mastering the art of french cooking by just 1:1 replacing with vegan butter etc. They are really good recipes!,
ll6r70e,t3_1f7drpj,1f7drpj,I would. If I want to veganize something and I can't find an existing recipe I can just look up the original. It's not like they profit from you looking at the book you already own.,
ll6zqa5,t3_1f7drpj,1f7drpj,Only the ones that you like or mean something to you.,
ll7iqwp,t3_1f7drpj,1f7drpj,"Umm. Yes! 

Learn to substitute and alter recipes. There are some real gems and techniques in vintage recipe books. Totally worth it. Only if you have the bravery and skill to attempt such endeavors.",

1/2 cup brown sugar
1/4 regular granulated sugar

If you don’t mind, I’d like to give you (and/or anyone reading this) some pointers to set you up for success! :) 

Be super careful not to overmix even a wee bit.  I usually am not as careful, but I was very ultra this time. She doesn’t have pictures to accompany her recipe, but you could probably even dump the chocolate chips, etc., in with the flour if you are afraid to overmix. If you’ve made those Secretly Vegan cookies, you’ve done this!  What I did was I didn’t run the paddle for more than, say, about 5 rotations, without taking my spatula and scraping the sides, the bottom of the bowl, and the paddle, itself. This made sure no flour was getting overworked just because of how close it was to the paddle. I dumped the ingredients in when there was still a great deal of flour visible and stopped as soon as I couldn’t see any white. It happens quickly. 

I used VioLife butter for this, straight from the fridge (I do think she says it must be cold). VioLife seems to be one of the better butters I’ve tried (I’m newer to veganism) and it worked really well, here!  I didn’t chuck all the butter cubes in, all at once. What I did was, I mixed the sugars (**Dark** brown and cane sugar— she calls for light brown. Definitely use dark!) with my flax egg and, then, as the paddle was turning on my stand mixer, I chucked in a cube at a time. Just a couple rotations of the paddle in between cubes. So, like a couple seconds, really. She said 2 minutes was sufficient, but it took me longer. Have all your other ingredients ready to go so that this creamed butter and sugar mixture stays cold. 

Also, when making the flax egg, I used boiling water, even though I don’t believe she specified that. Can’t remember. I’m not sure if you “have” to, but I did and I do think it worked better. I also gave it more than 5 minutes to thicken. Let’s say 8 mins. 

If you watch some Levain copycat videos, you’ll see the dough is quite dry. In some recipes, it doesn’t even come together on its own. It’s crumbly and needs to be patted/lumped together by hand. This wasn’t quite like that, but, what I’m saying is, I did know that this dough could not be too wet, as that would not allow for them to be thick enough. If you feel it’s too wet, add some flour. I actually added a hearty 2tbsp of flour, myself, at the end. This is because I added some vanilla (2tsp), which wasn’t called for, and I was worried about the dough even becoming the slightest bit too wet. I also figured, “hey, I mean, I do want them thick, anyway!”  

She said to refrigerate for 30 minutes. I think I did about four hours. These would probably be even better with a solid, 24 hour chill.  I also just used a large cookie scoop (my cookies were 3.5oz each) to portion them onto the tray before chilling. 

Right before baking, after that extended chill, I took my neatly-portioned cookies and properly roughed them up. Manhandled them. I broke them in half and stacked the halves atop one another, so that they were tall (make sure they’re tall) and rustic-looking. It was easier to do this with well-chilled dough. Then, I put them in the freezer for about 20 minutes. I baked five cookies, at once, for the first batch, and 3 for the last batch… I also ate a little bit of dough 🙃. 

If you don’t have sea salt, btw, kosher salt is fine. That’s what I used. I actually used a full tsp of kosher salt and, then, I added smoked salt to the top of the cookies. It would have been nice to use only smoked salt, I think. It gives such a cool flavor. Maybe it would have been too much?  I’ll try it out, next time. Maybe tonight. 

She also says to bake for 9-11 minutes at 410F. With my oven, I didn’t need to go over 9 minutes. Definitely not. I do have an overnight thermometer, but I never look at it, so I can’t say, for certain, if my oven was running hot. Anyway, I actually baked my second batch for only around 7 minutes. You want these thiccums to be gooey inside :) the best! I also baked on parchment paper, not Silpat (or anything silpat-adjacent). 

Lastly, this seems to be a good base for a thick cookie. Let your imagination run wild and stuff them with all sorts of ingredients! 

If you didn’t need these tips, then kindly disregard haha 😊. I’ll just keep ‘em here for anyone curious. If you have anything you want to add to this list, after baking yours, that you think would be helpful, then I’d definitely love to hear it :)!",🙃😊
kzvjcc9,t1_kzuvae0,1c5a1mj,Thank you so much :)!,
kzxxry9,t1_kzxct7j,1c5a1mj,🤤 There’s only one left and and I’m using every ounce of willpower in my body not to go downstairs and eat it. I will not cave!,🤤
kzswupt,t1_kzsswaa,1c5a1mj,"You sound exactly like me. I also took a break from baking because,I too ,like you have no self control(can finish whole unfrosted cake or whole tray of brownies in a day). I really don’t know how to do it seriously because I love baking but also finishing it even when I try not to😭😭",😭😭
kzsxz4v,t1_kzsswaa,1c5a1mj,And btw the cookies look sooo good,
kzx8t6u,t1_kzvh8uj,1c5a1mj,Thanks for taking the time to share all of that! Your tips are really helpful. I totally wouldn’t have thought to let the dough stay on the drier/crumblier side and then I’d probably end up disappointed when my cookies didn’t end up thick like yours. I’m just going to save this post so I can refer back to it later. 😬,😬
kzvj4nz,t1_kzswupt,1c5a1mj,"Same!  The easiest thing for me to do is to just not have sweets around. Candy, I can control myself. Cookies, brownies, cheesecakes?  Nope. No shot. When I started baking last year, I gained 20 lbs. Yep. TWENTY POUNDS. I’ve lost that, since then, but it was extremely annoying.  Losing weight is just soooo annoying. 

I have a very addictive personality. My biggest issue in life is finding a balance. With that being said, it’s interesting that I could really care less about savory foods. I’m not a big snacker, otherwise. I’m never like “hmm.. I really want some ______ (name of a savory snack)!”  It’s just that sweet, sweet sugar that gets me 😵‍💫",😵💫
kzvj67j,t1_kzsxz4v,1c5a1mj,And thank you ☺️!!!,☺
kzxxnk8,t1_kzx8t6u,1c5a1mj,"You’re welcome!  

This dough isn’t quite as like crumbly/dry, as the other ones I’ve seen. Cupcake Jemma’s vegan chocolate chip and raspberry “NYC cookies” come to mind (they’re Levain copycats, too). It’s just it’s definitely not a wetter dough, which many vegan cookie doughs can be a little wet. You know?  You’ll see :) be sure to make them tall, also!  I think they’ll come out great!",
kzwt4pn,t1_kzvj4nz,1c5a1mj,"Should I be happy or sad that there are people like me! I also realised that if I don’t have that food near me I wont eat it. I haven’t made any full recipes in god knows how long(other than 1 birthday cake). Even the single serve ones, I’ve only made them a few times in a really long time. Yes losing weight is not easy but for me, its the guilt after eating that much that really bothers me.",
kzxx9nz,t1_kzwt4pn,1c5a1mj,"Yeah, the guilt is definitely tough. You feel so low, especially after the high of eating something indulgent.  High to very low. Sometimes it can feel like you ruined a whole day of “good” eating. 

Yeah, having food within reach is a big one. People will just snack, even if they’re not hungry— myself included, of course. Lots of psychology involved when it comes to eating. 

It can be a battle, for sure.",
kzxyq03,t1_kzxx9nz,1c5a1mj,Well we just have to try controlling ourselves because there’s nothing else we can do.✊,✊

luuzxza,t3_1gh63ad,1gh63ad,The best thing to do is not try to adapt a non vegan recipe when eggs are such an important and main ingredient. Look for a recipe that’s written to be vegan so there is no stress about substituting and if said substitutions will work.,

luxhx76,t3_1gh63ad,1gh63ad,I would have to see the recipe to knowwhat to suggest for sure but I bet either Just Egg would do the trick for a filling or even flax if you mix it with water and let it gel up a bit .:),

luxme5c,t1_luxlydo,1gh63ad,"Actually yea, really well. I think the rough estimate is that 3 tablespoons of it equals about one egg. I say it works best for certain cakes and cookies especailly if you don't want to use flax as a replacer because it changes the coloring of your baked good a tiny bit. I used it in a few of my recipes. Let me know if you try it",
