First recipe out of Brian Watsons (Thee Burger Dude) Vegan Fast Food cookbook. Absolutely incredible! Truly brought me back to 1985 and eight-year-old me sharing a big Mac with my grandma! 

Highly recommend this book if you ever get hand greens for fast food, but want to control how it‚Äôs made .

Ingredients:

For the Ravioli Dough:

- 300g all-purpose flour
- 100g semolina flour
- 1 tsp salt
- 200ml warm water
- 2 tbsp olive oil

For the Ravioli Filling:

- 200g firm tofu, crumbled
- 2 tbsp nutritional yeast
- 1 clove garlic, minced
- 1 tbsp lemon juice
- Salt and black pepper, to taste

For the Roasted Red Pepper Sauce:

- 3 large red bell peppers
- 2 tbsp olive oil
- 1 medium onion, finely chopped
- 3 cloves garlic, minced
- 200ml vegan cream cheese
- 1 tbsp nutritional yeast
- 1 tsp smoked paprika
- 1 tsp dried oregano
- Salt and freshly ground black pepper, to taste
- 1 tsp lemon juice

For Garnish:

- Fresh basil leaves, chopped

Method:

1. Preheat your oven to 200¬∞C. Cut the red bell peppers in half and remove the seeds and membranes. Place them on a baking tray lined with parchment paper, cut side down. Roast for 20-25 minutes, or until the skin is charred and blistered. Once roasted, place the peppers in a bowl and cover with cling film for 10 minutes to steam. Peel off the skin and set the roasted peppers aside.

2. In a large frying pan, heat 1 tablespoon of olive oil over medium heat. Add the chopped onion and saut√© for 5-6 minutes until softened and translucent. Stir in the minced garlic and cook for another 1-2 minutes until fragrant.

3. Add the roasted red peppers to a blender, along with the saut√©ed onion and garlic. Spoon in the vegan cream cheese, nutritional yeast, smoked paprika, and dried oregano. Blend until the mixture is smooth and creamy. Season with salt, black pepper, and lemon juice to taste.

4. To make the ravioli dough, combine the all-purpose flour, semolina flour, and salt in a large bowl. Make a well in the centre and add the warm water and olive oil. Mix until a dough forms, then knead on a floured surface for 8-10 minutes until smooth and elastic. Wrap in cling film and let it rest for 20 minutes.

5. While the dough is resting, prepare the filling. In a medium bowl, combine the crumbled tofu, nutritional yeast, minced garlic, lemon juice, salt, and black pepper. Mix well until evenly combined.

6. Once the dough has rested, divide it into two equal portions. Roll each portion out on a floured surface until it is very thin (about 2mm thick). Place small spoonfuls of the filling, about 4cm apart, on one sheet of the rolled dough. Place the second sheet of dough over the top, pressing around each mound of filling to seal. Use a knife or ravioli cutter to cut out individual ravioli pieces, ensuring the edges are sealed well.

7. Bring a large pot of salted water to a boil. Cook the ravioli in batches for 3-4 minutes, or until they float to the surface. Drain and set aside.

8. Pour the blended roasted red pepper sauce back into the frying pan and warm it over low heat. Add the cooked ravioli to the sauce, gently tossing to coat each piece in the creamy sauce.

9. Divide the creamy ravioli between four bowls. Garnish with chopped fresh basil leaves for a burst of colour and flavour.

veganrecipes,"If you have a rice cooker, rinse your sushi rice until it runs clear and then put in a splash of rice wine vinegar, a tablespoon of sugar, and a little salt. Otherwise, stovetop is fine. You're going to want a short grained rice.

The filling I did today was five spears asparagus, a small sweet potato, and avocado. I cooked up the sweet potato matchsticks and asparagus in a skillet while my eel sauce was reducing.

Eel sauce: equal parts soy sauce, sugar, and mirin. Just simmer until thick. 1/4 cup of each will perfectly fit in a soy sauce dish and is probably enough for 2 or even 3 people.

Put down some aluminum foil in a baking tray and spread the prepared rice on it to quickly cool.

You can watch a quick YouTube video on how to roll them, but I'll explain anyway. You can get a cheap bamboo rolling mat if you make it a lot, but for years I just used a bit of plastic wrap. Put rice on most of the nori (shiny side down) leaving 1/2 inch plain on the end. Lay filling in a line down the middle. Roll the nori over the filling, then complete the roll and shape evenly with slight pressure. Use a large serrated knife to cut it in a gentle sawing motion. If you want to use a non serrated knife it needs to be really sharp. The thing to do is to lightly cut into the wrap a little before you add more pressure. It'll make sense when you do it.

Bonus: crunchy stuff is just panko toasted in vegan butter. You can do spicy mayo with just sriracha and vegan mayo, but go heavy on the sriracha. You can get wasabi and pickled ginger online if your store doesn't sell it.

For those who want to know, the sushi pictured was 800 calories and 17 grams of protein.

All this to say, once the rice is ready it'll take 5 to 10 minutes to prepare. I made 2 cups of rice for 3 rolls, but didn't use it all. Also, not pictured are all the end pieces I ate while I was making it.

veganrecipes,"[Full recipe available here](https://www.plantifulpalate.com/post/homemade-vegan-gnocchi)

Ingredients:

For the Gnocchi:
- 1kg floury potatoes (e.g., Maris Piper), peeled and boiled
- 200g plain flour, plus extra for dusting
- 1 tsp salt

For the Tomato Sauce:
- 2 tbsp olive oil
- 1 large onion, finely chopped
- 3 garlic cloves, minced
- 1 tsp ground cumin
- 1 tsp smoked paprika
- 1/2 tsp chilli flakes (optional)
- 400g canned chopped tomatoes
- 2 tbsp tomato pur√©e
- 1 tsp sugar (optional, to balance acidity)
- Salt and freshly ground black pepper, to taste

For the Plant-Based Cream:
- 150g unsweetened plant-based yoghurt (e.g., coconut or soy)
- 1 tsp lemon juice
- 1/4 tsp garlic powder
- Pinch of salt

For Garnish:
- 2 tbsp fresh parsley, chopped
- Freshly ground black pepper

Method:

1. To make the gnocchi, start by peeling the potatoes using a vegetable peeler. Rinse them under cold water to remove any residual starch. Place the peeled potatoes in a large pot and cover with cold, salted water. Bring to a boil and cook for 15-20 minutes, or until the potatoes are fork-tender but not falling apart. Drain the potatoes and let them sit for a few minutes to release excess steam. Mash the potatoes using a potato ricer or masher until completely smooth, ensuring there are no lumps. Allow them to cool slightly. Gradually mix the flour and salt into the mashed potatoes, adding a little at a time, until a soft dough forms. Knead the mixture gently until it forms a soft dough. Avoid overworking the dough to keep the gnocchi light and fluffy.

2. Divide the dough into four portions. Roll each portion into a long rope about 2cm in diameter, then cut into 2cm pieces. For a classic gnocchi texture, press each piece gently with the back of a fork to create ridges. Dust with a little flour to prevent sticking.

3. Bring a large pot of salted water to a boil. Add the gnocchi in batches and cook until they float to the surface, about 2-3 minutes. Remove with a slotted spoon and set aside.

4. For the tomato sauce, heat olive oil in a large frying pan over medium heat. Add the chopped onion and saut√© for 6-8 minutes until softened and translucent. Stir in the minced garlic and cook for an additional 1-2 minutes until fragrant.

5. Add the ground cumin, smoked paprika, and chilli flakes (if using) to the pan, stirring to coat the onion mixture. Cook for 30 seconds to release the spices‚Äô aromas.

6. Stir in the canned tomatoes, tomato pur√©e, and sugar (if needed). Season with salt and black pepper. Simmer the sauce over medium heat for 10-12 minutes, stirring occasionally, until it thickens slightly and the flavours meld together.

7. While the sauce simmers, prepare the plant-based cream by whisking together the yoghurt, lemon juice, garlic powder, and a pinch of salt in a small bowl. Set aside.

8. Add the cooked gnocchi to the tomato sauce, stirring gently to coat them evenly. Simmer for an additional 2-3 minutes to warm through.

9. Transfer the gnocchi and sauce to serving bowls. Add dollops of the plant-based cream on top and garnish with fresh parsley, a drizzle of extra virgin olive oil and a generous sprinkle of freshly ground black pepper.

10. Serve warm and enjoy!

Recipe:
Ingredients:

For the cauliflower wings:
  - 1 medium cauliflower, cut into florets
  - 1 cup plain flour
  - 1 cup water
  - 1 teaspoon garlic powder
  - 1 teaspoon smoked paprika
  - ¬Ω teaspoon salt
  - ¬Ω teaspoon black pepper
  - Oil, for frying

For the sweet and spicy soy glaze:
  - ¬Ω cup soy sauce (use a low-sodium variety if preferred)
  - ¬º cup maple syrup

Method:

1. In a large bowl, whisk together the flour, water, garlic powder, smoked paprika, salt, and black pepper until smooth. The batter should have a thick, pancake-like consistency that clings to the cauliflower florets. Adjust with more water or flour as needed.

2. Pour enough oil into a deep frying pan to cover the bottom by about an inch. Heat over medium-high heat until a small drop of batter sizzles upon contact.

3. Dip each cauliflower floret into the batter, ensuring it‚Äôs fully covered. Carefully place the coated florets into the hot oil, frying in batches to avoid overcrowding. Fry for about 5-7 minutes or until golden brown and crispy. Remove with a slotted spoon and drain on a paper towel to remove excess oil.

4. In a small saucepan, combine the soy sauce, maple syrup, sriracha, garlic, and ginger. Bring to a gentle simmer over medium heat, stirring occasionally. Once the mixture is heated through, add the cornflour mixture and stir continuously until the sauce thickens and becomes glossy, about 2 minutes.

5. Transfer the fried cauliflower wings into a large mixing bowl. Pour the hot glaze over the wings, tossing gently to coat each piece thoroughly with the sauce.

6. Serve immediately, garnished with sesame seeds and chopped spring onions for added crunch and flavour. These wings are best enjoyed hot, straight from the pan, while they retain their crispiness.

* 1/2 cup nutritional yeast (for added ""cheesy"" flavour)
* 2 tbsp vegan butter
* 2 tbsp all-purpose flour (to make the roux)
* 1 tsp garlic powder (for extra depth of flavour)
* 1 tsp onion powder
* 1/2 tsp smoked paprika (plus extra for garnish)
* Salt and pepper, to taste
* Fresh parsley, chopped (for garnish)

Method:
1. Bring a large pot of salted water to a boil and cook the macaroni until it‚Äôs al dente, according to the package instructions. Drain and set aside.
2. In a large saucepan, melt the vegan butter over medium heat. Whisk in the flour to create a roux and cook for about 2 minutes, ensuring it doesn‚Äôt brown. This forms the base of the creamy cheese sauce.
3. Gradually whisk in the almond milk, stirring constantly to prevent lumps. Continue cooking until the mixture thickens slightly, around 3-4 minutes.
4. Add the shredded vegan cheddar, nutritional yeast, garlic powder, onion powder, smoked paprika, and a pinch of salt and pepper. Stir continuously until the cheese has melted and the sauce is smooth and creamy. If the sauce appears too thick, you can add a little more almond milk to reach your desired consistency.
5. Stir in the cooked macaroni, ensuring every piece is well coated with the luscious vegan cheese sauce.
6. Transfer to a serving dish and sprinkle extra smoked paprika on top for a touch of colour and heat. Garnish with fresh parsley for a pop of green and serve hot.

veganrecipes,"[Full recipe available here.](https://www.plantifulpalate.com/post/vegan-tofu-jalfrezi)

Ingredients:
- 400g firm tofu, drained and cubed
- 2 tbsp vegetable oil
- 1 large onion, thinly sliced
- 2 cloves garlic, minced
- 1-inch piece of ginger, grated
- 2 large tomatoes, pureed
- 1 red bell pepper, chopped
- 1 green bell pepper, chopped
- 2 green chilies, sliced
- 1 tsp cumin seeds
- 1 tsp ground coriander
- 1 tsp ground cumin
- 1 tsp turmeric powder
- 1 tsp garam masala
- Salt, to taste
- Fresh coriander, chopped (for garnish)

Method:
1. Begin by pressing the tofu to remove excess moisture. Wrap the tofu in a clean kitchen towel and place a heavy object on top for about 15 minutes. Once pressed, cut the tofu into bite-sized cubes and set them aside.

2. Heat the vegetable oil in a large pan over medium heat. Add the cumin seeds and wait for them to sizzle and pop, releasing their aromatic oils. This is your foundation of flavor.

3. Add the thinly sliced onions to the pan and saut√© them until they turn a deep golden brown. This caramelization process enhances the sweetness of the onions, balancing the heat of the spices. Next, stir in the minced garlic and grated ginger, cooking until fragrant‚Äîabout 2 minutes.

4. Pour in the pureed tomatoes, stirring them into the onion mixture. Cook this down until the oil begins to separate from the tomato base, creating a rich masala. This step is key to developing the deep, complex flavors that define a good jalfrezi.

5. Incorporate the ground coriander, ground cumin, turmeric, and garam masala into the tomato mixture. Cook the spices for 3-4 minutes, allowing them to bloom and infuse the masala with their warmth and depth.

6. Toss in the chopped red and green bell peppers along with the sliced green chilies. Stir everything together and let the peppers cook for 5-7 minutes. They should soften slightly but retain a bit of crunch, adding texture to the dish.

7. Gently fold in the tofu cubes, ensuring they are evenly coated with the spiced masala. Allow the tofu to simmer in the sauce for about 5 minutes, soaking up all the wonderful flavors.

8. Adjust the seasoning with salt to taste. Garnish generously with freshly chopped coriander before serving.

Ingredients:

	‚Ä¢	400g vegan tagliatelle
	‚Ä¢	2 tbsp olive oil
	‚Ä¢	1 clove garlic, minced
	‚Ä¢	100g fresh basil leaves
	‚Ä¢	50g rocket (arugula), plus extra for garnish
	‚Ä¢	30g pine nuts
	‚Ä¢	3 tbsp nutritional yeast
	‚Ä¢	100ml extra virgin olive oil
	‚Ä¢	Juice of 1/2 lemon
	‚Ä¢	Salt and freshly ground black pepper
	‚Ä¢	100g sun-dried tomatoes, drained and roughly chopped
	‚Ä¢	80g pitted black olives

Method:

	1.	Bring a large pot of salted water to a boil. Add the tagliatelle and cook according to the package instructions, or until al dente. Once cooked, drain and reserve a cup of the pasta cooking water. Set the tagliatelle aside.
	2.	While the pasta is cooking, prepare the pesto. In a food processor, combine the fresh basil leaves, rocket, pine nuts, nutritional yeast, lemon juice, and minced garlic. Blend until well combined, slowly pouring in the extra virgin olive oil while processing until a smooth pesto forms. Season with salt and black pepper to taste.
	3.	In a large frying pan, heat 2 tablespoons of olive oil over medium heat. Add the drained sun-dried tomatoes and saut√© for 2-3 minutes, allowing their flavours to deepen. Add the pitted black olives and stir well to combine, letting them warm through for another minute.
	4.	Reduce the heat to low and add the cooked tagliatelle to the pan. Toss gently to coat the pasta with the sun-dried tomatoes and olives. Add the prepared pesto to the pasta, using a little of the reserved pasta cooking water if needed to help loosen the sauce and ensure every strand is evenly coated.
	5.	Once everything is well combined and heated through, remove from the heat. Serve the tagliatelle in bowls, garnishing with a handful of fresh rocket leaves for an added peppery bite.
