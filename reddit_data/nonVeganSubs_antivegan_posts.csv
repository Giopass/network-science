AntiVegan,"Hi all, I'm new here. I just want to share my personal story that traumatized me about veganism. I have a wife, she is vegan and anti-onion.

I was diagnosed Lymphoma (a type of blood cancer) in December 2023 (you can see some of my post on lymphoma reddit community), and need to have chemotherapy. My chemotherapy began in February 2024.

My oncologists said that no vegan thing especially during chemotherapy period, and I need to eat meat especially chicken or fish meat, less red meat (eating vegetables or fruits is okay but must also eat meat). But I had clash with my wife, because she insisted that I must be vegan to cure the cancer without giving any (no) proper medical research. My oncologists said that there are many chemo patients that need blood infusion or lower survival rate because of low HB (Hemoglobin), eating too low meat and too much vegetables or fruits, the risks were told and it is my decision. But my wife insisted that I should not hear the doctor, the doctors or other medical professionals would not accept vegan things. Then my decision was that I heard what oncologists said.

She is mad, and she never accompany me during chemo treatments, she only sent vegan food during chemo days.

The results of my decision are: my PET Scan (August 14th, 2024) didn't detect any cancer activities ; I never have blood infusion during chemo treatment, my HB tests are always normal and CBC tests are healed on time, so no delayed chemo.

I met many other patients during these period, I had chitchat with them during waiting for the oncologist, and many of them got bad condition and delayed chemo because they ate too many vegetables and too low meat, just like what oncologists said, because many of them had very limited money.

And, before my first chemo, I consumed many herbal medicines (not from medical professionals) from my wife, and the result was the cancer wasn't shrinking and the symptoms became bad and severe (more bloody coughing).

I then think, if I follow my wife, my condition might be bad like these people. I'm grateful that I choose the right decision, and I get remission. Now, I'm thinking of having divorcement with her, I disliked her vegan extreme principles that didn't think about humanity.
