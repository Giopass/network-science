FoodPorn,"[Full recipe available here.](https://www.plantifulpalate.com/post/vegan-ravioli)


Ingredients:

For the Ravioli Dough:

- 300g all-purpose flour
- 100g semolina flour
- 1 tsp salt
- 200ml warm water
- 2 tbsp olive oil

For the Ravioli Filling:

- 200g firm tofu, crumbled
- 2 tbsp nutritional yeast
- 1 clove garlic, minced
- 1 tbsp lemon juice
- Salt and black pepper, to taste

For the Roasted Red Pepper Sauce:

- 3 large red bell peppers
- 2 tbsp olive oil
- 1 medium onion, finely chopped
- 3 cloves garlic, minced
- 200ml vegan cream cheese
- 1 tbsp nutritional yeast
- 1 tsp smoked paprika
- 1 tsp dried oregano
- Salt and freshly ground black pepper, to taste
- 1 tsp lemon juice

For Garnish:

- Fresh basil leaves, chopped

Method:

1. Preheat your oven to 200¬∞C. Cut the red bell peppers in half and remove the seeds and membranes. Place them on a baking tray lined with parchment paper, cut side down. Roast for 20-25 minutes, or until the skin is charred and blistered. Once roasted, place the peppers in a bowl and cover with cling film for 10 minutes to steam. Peel off the skin and set the roasted peppers aside.

2. In a large frying pan, heat 1 tablespoon of olive oil over medium heat. Add the chopped onion and saut√© for 5-6 minutes until softened and translucent. Stir in the minced garlic and cook for another 1-2 minutes until fragrant.

3. Add the roasted red peppers to a blender, along with the saut√©ed onion and garlic. Spoon in the vegan cream cheese, nutritional yeast, smoked paprika, and dried oregano. Blend until the mixture is smooth and creamy. Season with salt, black pepper, and lemon juice to taste.

4. To make the ravioli dough, combine the all-purpose flour, semolina flour, and salt in a large bowl. Make a well in the centre and add the warm water and olive oil. Mix until a dough forms, then knead on a floured surface for 8-10 minutes until smooth and elastic. Wrap in cling film and let it rest for 20 minutes.

5. While the dough is resting, prepare the filling. In a medium bowl, combine the crumbled tofu, nutritional yeast, minced garlic, lemon juice, salt, and black pepper. Mix well until evenly combined.

6. Once the dough has rested, divide it into two equal portions. Roll each portion out on a floured surface until it is very thin (about 2mm thick). Place small spoonfuls of the filling, about 4cm apart, on one sheet of the rolled dough. Place the second sheet of dough over the top, pressing around each mound of filling to seal. Use a knife or ravioli cutter to cut out individual ravioli pieces, ensuring the edges are sealed well.

7. Bring a large pot of salted water to a boil. Cook the ravioli in batches for 3-4 minutes, or until they float to the surface. Drain and set aside.

8. Pour the blended roasted red pepper sauce back into the frying pan and warm it over low heat. Add the cooked ravioli to the sauce, gently tossing to coat each piece in the creamy sauce.

9. Divide the creamy ravioli between four bowls. Garnish with chopped fresh basil leaves for a burst of colour and flavour.

FoodPorn,"[Full recipe available here](https://www.plantifulpalate.com/post/homemade-vegan-gnocchi)

Ingredients:

For the Gnocchi:
- 1kg floury potatoes (e.g., Maris Piper), peeled and boiled
- 200g plain flour, plus extra for dusting
- 1 tsp salt

For the Tomato Sauce:
- 2 tbsp olive oil
- 1 large onion, finely chopped
- 3 garlic cloves, minced
- 1 tsp ground cumin
- 1 tsp smoked paprika
- 1/2 tsp chilli flakes (optional)
- 400g canned chopped tomatoes
- 2 tbsp tomato pur√©e
- 1 tsp sugar (optional, to balance acidity)
- Salt and freshly ground black pepper, to taste

For the Plant-Based Cream:
- 150g unsweetened plant-based yoghurt (e.g., coconut or soy)
- 1 tsp lemon juice
- 1/4 tsp garlic powder
- Pinch of salt

For Garnish:
- 2 tbsp fresh parsley, chopped
- Freshly ground black pepper

Method:

1. To make the gnocchi, start by peeling the potatoes using a vegetable peeler. Rinse them under cold water to remove any residual starch. Place the peeled potatoes in a large pot and cover with cold, salted water. Bring to a boil and cook for 15-20 minutes, or until the potatoes are fork-tender but not falling apart. Drain the potatoes and let them sit for a few minutes to release excess steam. Mash the potatoes using a potato ricer or masher until completely smooth, ensuring there are no lumps. Allow them to cool slightly. Gradually mix the flour and salt into the mashed potatoes, adding a little at a time, until a soft dough forms. Knead the mixture gently until it forms a soft dough. Avoid overworking the dough to keep the gnocchi light and fluffy.

2. Divide the dough into four portions. Roll each portion into a long rope about 2cm in diameter, then cut into 2cm pieces. For a classic gnocchi texture, press each piece gently with the back of a fork to create ridges. Dust with a little flour to prevent sticking.

3. Bring a large pot of salted water to a boil. Add the gnocchi in batches and cook until they float to the surface, about 2-3 minutes. Remove with a slotted spoon and set aside.

4. For the tomato sauce, heat olive oil in a large frying pan over medium heat. Add the chopped onion and saut√© for 6-8 minutes until softened and translucent. Stir in the minced garlic and cook for an additional 1-2 minutes until fragrant.

5. Add the ground cumin, smoked paprika, and chilli flakes (if using) to the pan, stirring to coat the onion mixture. Cook for 30 seconds to release the spices‚Äô aromas.

6. Stir in the canned tomatoes, tomato pur√©e, and sugar (if needed). Season with salt and black pepper. Simmer the sauce over medium heat for 10-12 minutes, stirring occasionally, until it thickens slightly and the flavours meld together.

7. While the sauce simmers, prepare the plant-based cream by whisking together the yoghurt, lemon juice, garlic powder, and a pinch of salt in a small bowl. Set aside.

8. Add the cooked gnocchi to the tomato sauce, stirring gently to coat them evenly. Simmer for an additional 2-3 minutes to warm through.

9. Transfer the gnocchi and sauce to serving bowls. Add dollops of the plant-based cream on top and garnish with fresh parsley, a drizzle of extra virgin olive oil and a generous sprinkle of freshly ground black pepper.

10. Serve warm and enjoy!
