m3p43d4,t1_m3ofkvb,1hlqlgq,If they have Muslim or Jewish people in the shelter they probably wouldn't be able to eat the grilled cheese sandwiches if they were seared in lard. Butter is a safer option in that scenario.,

I've never made a large batch of grilled cheese, but I think that would be easiest. 

If you really wanted to serve quickly you could pre-toast a bunch of bread then just broil two halves with cheese to serve. Bread would probably be a bit chewy or dry depending how long and how it's stored.",

What recipe do you usually use? I like the naan recipe by *Cafe Delites* ""Buttery Garlic Naan"" and *I Am a Food Blog* ""The Easiest Naan"" recipes. 

Only thing I can recommend is not adding extra flour when kneading and don't let it overcook. I have the best luck with naans that use yogurt.",

I mostly purchase my commonly used spices/seasonings in larger quantities on Amazon. Usually save a lot more money that way. For an example, Badia brand coriander 14oz container is $7.80 ($0.56/ounce) vs. McCormick 1.25oz bottle for $4.94 ($3.95/oz) even Great Value brand is 1.5oz bottle for $4.36($2.91/ounce)

Also checkout to see if you have Asian supermarkets or other international stores around you. You'll find most of the spices you need there for cheaper.",

When done, pull the chicken out, stick blender the liquid, then add cilantro, heavy cream, ,a little more curry powder, and butter, and stir until dissolved.

Especially important under the skin. You can throw in oven right away, but I let my bird rest with the marinade in fridge for 2 hours until I was ready to start dinner.

The best ones I've had always have a slightly eggy taste to them (think of an [egg bagel](https://imgur.com/a/I6D1vPt)). 

They are, in my honest opinion, the peak of British Culinary art. I've been known to sit down with a plate of Yorkies and a bowl of gravy, and just have that for my dinner. 

They're basically enriched bread that's (usually) cooked in beef fat. 

For my birthday last year, my wife made 3 dozen of them, cooked in Wagyu fat, served alongside a beef Wellington. I had nothing but nine Yorkies and some gravy on my first plate while I was waiting for the Welly to cool off. 

The little cup shape is just perfect. There's a UK themed restaurant near me, and they do an English Roast Dinner. The whole thing is served inside a GIANT (10"" diameter) Yorkie. I've been there more than 100 times in the past 12 years.

Then when people started making deserts/cakes by boiling them, they called them puddings because the cooking method was similar in that the batter was wrapped in cloth and boiled. 

We still have many savoury puddings here in the UK, such as black pudding (blood sausage), steak and kidney pudding (made with suet pastry and filled with meat and gravy), rag pudding (beef and gravy in suet pastry but boiled in a cloth instead of a bowl). 

Sweet puddings are often more cake like, using bread, batters and fruit. Examples are Christmas pudding, sticky toffee pudding, jam Roly poly etc. some are also not boiled like summer pudding, which is made in a pudding bowl but it set in the fridge rather than boiled.",

Also I make roasties done in duck fat (with a dusting of flour, garlic powder and rosemary and thyme) AND potato gratin dauphinoise.

As I was saying, an English pudding is similar to a light and fluffy biscuit because Americans tend to eat them with gravy and meat and the same stuff that English folks put in their puddins‚Äô,
Hence the similarity (and texture) to biscuits. And when I think of popover‚Äôs i think of them to be flakey, light and crusty and usually made with phyllo (for me at least) and filled with sweet things, and ate for breakfast.  Sorry to say I really don‚Äôt think any one cares what we think. Try not to lose sleep over it. Take care!

lhvvmsd,t1_lhtq12y,1eqe222,"A few Yorkie At Home tips:

* The ingredients are simple: equal volume of egg / milk / flour is kind of foolproof, then add salt and pepper to taste. This means start with (typically four) eggs of any size and balance the milk and flour to match
* preheat your fat in the yorkie/muffin tray in the oven, then pour in your batter when it's smoking
* Pizza rules apply: if you like a crusty exterior and eggy/chewy interior, max out the temp of your oven and go for a shorter bake. This technique requires a working oven light and monitoring, but imo makes the best yorkies.
* some people like to substitue a bit of water for the milk, I don't think it's vital
* some people insist on storing it in the fridge beforehand, I don't

When using these techniques, I get a lot of ""*you* made these?"" from my british friends.

Also any creamy dip pairs amazingly with yorkies. Creme fraiche + horseradish and chives if you're in the UK or straight up Ranch if you're in the US. Yorkies + ranch dip is divine.",

lhw0vzc,t1_lhtq12y,1eqe222,"I've been making the batter since I was child, so it's way easier than people think! (It's why I'll never eat Aunt Bessie's!).¬†


The recipe I've always used is: mix 1/4 pint milk, 1/4 pint water, 2 eggs and 4 oz flour.. Put the batter in the fridge while you're doing the rest of your prep for your meal and have your oven preheating the oil in a muffin/tin. When the oil is hot enough to sizzle at a drop of the mix you're good to fill your tray up to the half way in each spot, put in the oven for roughly 30 mins (don't open the door to check until 20 mins have passed) and then enjoy!¬†


The above was for 12 Yorkie puds, so obviously adjust for portion sizes (we were a family of 6). Or just have a tonne of Yorkie puds to snack on throughout the week.¬†


Also perhaps controversial but you can absolutely eat them for dessert too! Stewed fruit with them was the traditional choice but personally as a kid I'd eat them with a scoop of ice cream and golden syrup. They are after all made with the same stuff as crepes!¬†",
lhwfccr,t1_lhtq12y,1eqe222,"The BBC recipe is similar to my family's recipe. This should make 12 puddings in a muffin tray:

4 eggs,  
225g plain flour, 
300ml milk, 
1 tsp salt, 
Optional 1/8 tsp finely ground white pepper

Preheat oven to 225C, put the oil (always beef tallow) in the muffin tray (a tsp should do but you will figure out what works for you), put it in to heat up for 5 mins or so, pour pudding batter into tray (should make a nice sizzle sound). Place back in oven. Reduce oven to 200C.

Should take about 20mins or until they are nicely browned. This is something you will have to figure out as they can flop if not crisp enough but you don't want them dry and crispy.

Either way a solid recipe for Yorkies doesn‚Äôt really exist and really the only way to learn to make them is trial and error. But it‚Äôs just flour, milk and eggs (I also use a little water) so your ‚Äúfailures‚Äù will always still be edible and cheap anyway.",
lhvwoho,t1_lhtq12y,1eqe222,"They have a lot of myth around them, but they‚Äôre actually really easy, and you just get better over time.¬†

I use 150g flour, 200ml milk, and 4 eggs. You can alter the recipe by adjusting by total eggs. So sometimes I‚Äôll do a wee batch and use 2 eggs, 100ml milk, and 75g flour. Mix it and leave it for 20 minutes. There‚Äôs no magic here, it‚Äôs literally a crepe batter.¬†

You don‚Äôt actually need hot oil and you can open the oven to check near the start and near the end. Only around the middle of the cooking time should you avoid it.¬†
I‚Äôve made great ones putting batter in cold oil and sticking them in a cold oven and whacking it on.¬†

But to make it properly out some oil, preferably lard, into either a muffin tin or even a large sided oven tray, depending on how much batter there is. Stick it in the oven on about 350-400 Fahrenheit so it all heats up. You can do this after you‚Äôve made your batter because that needs resting for a bit anyway. Once it‚Äôs all hot pour the batter into whatever our using, close the oven, and leave it for 30-45 odd minutes. It‚Äôs hard to give direct advice for this because every oven is different. Adjust accordingly after a few tries. You can open the door after about 25-30 minutes. They‚Äôll have risen and be starting to set. The rest of the time is to make them golden.¬†

America does have Yorkshire puddings, or something super close. They‚Äôre just called popovers.¬†

lhyu4he,t1_lhxq1qe,1eqe222,"I wouldn't say it's a conscious substitution per se, it's moreso that there is a subgroup of older British people that were taught that quality ingredients make the food taste good on its own, and so they prioritise this without much thought for seasoning at all, rather than actively choosing against seasoning

This mostly stems from rationing during and after the wars, when people had essentially 0 access to spices but might occasionally be able to get their hands on some quality ingredients. This led them to value that significantly higher, and their kids then learnt that cooking philosophy from them

It's dying out very rapidly though. It's not very prevalent amongst young people at all, who (if they cook at all) are usually very good cooks these days. If anything, I'd say the lack of a dominant domestic cuisine/spice profile has probably actually made them more open to new cuisines than many cultures, increasing their exposure and widening their variety way more than most",

lmao",
lpffcot,t1_lpd576l,1frg3hp,"I think some sugar or oil in the dough recipe can help with browning. And certainly having your oven cranked up to 550 (which is where most home ovens top out I believe) will help. And of course having a long pre-heated pizza stone or steel to quickly transfer the heat into the dough as soon as you slide it on.

Other than that, if you're making a super thing crust, do you even have a crust edge like that to get bubbly and brown? Do you roll it flat with a rolling pin? If so you're rolling out all the bubbles that would make it bubbly. Even by hand, if you go so thin it's just not going to have many bubbles left to expand.

When I stretch out my dough I definitely make it with the crust edge in tact so that it can get bubbly, crisp, and browned. It's not as much of the edge as you might think. Maybe experiment with ways to stretch out the dough.",
lpdks3i,t1_lpd576l,1frg3hp,An agent that can help promote browning. Something like sugar or diastatic malt. Could also try cutting/grating your cheese coarser so that the crust can experience a longer bake.,

lpg1peq,t1_lpd576l,1frg3hp,"If the crust is thin it won't take as long to bake and therefore won't get that fat leoparding on the crust, which takes a little bit of time in front of heat to develop (with residential ovens, anyway)

also all these recommendations about oil etc are good but don't be afraid to splash some of the tomato sauce itself up on the crust while you're spreading it around, seems like OP did that and it gives a nice amount of colour as the sauce burns a little when unburdened by cheese",
lpgnyis,t1_lpd576l,1frg3hp,"How hot does your oven go? Nu Cristiano browning and bubbleing is large dependent on two factors:

Dough hydration

lphegky,t1_lpd576l,1frg3hp,"Crispy browned crust is accomplished through two ways: properly leavened dough and high heat. 

Most top pizza places make their dough 1-2 days ahead of time and allow for a slow ferment in the fridge. Something about that slow ferment creates sugars that brown. Your typical pizza dough recipe (one warm ferment) won‚Äôt do it. 

High heat. Get a pizza stone on the top rack. Crank the oven to max. Use a pizza paddle.

lpf2wi7,t1_lpf2k1x,1frg3hp,Good tip to know. I'm not very good at baking so doing a pizza right is a huge win.,
lpe1qhk,t1_lpdy0xo,1frg3hp,I'll try that. And maybe add some flaky salt as well,
lpgv74t,t1_lpdy0xo,1frg3hp,Some ovens have a combined top grill and convection mode. I find it really useful for pizzas. Neff call it their Circoroast mode.,

lpfe3mo,t1_lpfc8bp,1frg3hp,"That's not quite right, unless you just phrased it incorrectly. I've always understood it to be water to flour ratio. (Or maybe liquid to dry, but non water and flour ingredients should be mostly negligible). So 60 grams water to 100 grams flour is 60% hydration.

The way you phrased it makes it sound to me that you mean 60 (water) / 160 (total) being 37.5% hydration.",

lsw7fw8,t1_lsw6qk8,1g879fs,"Thank you. I made them. You need a silicon mold but they are cheap and easy to get online. To make the skulls, I used ciliegine (the small mozzarella balls): Preheat the oven to 350¬∫F and set the silicon molds onto a rimmed baking sheet for stability. Lightly grease the interiors of the skull molds. Add a ball of mozzarella to each skull cavity. Bake for 6-8 minutes to soften the cheese - it will not melt but will become pliable. Use a folded paper napkin to press the softened cheese into the molds (the paper towel will absorb the liquid that is released from the mozzarella, which will be more than you think). Press the cheese well into the molds to get a good form, being careful not to burn yourself. Transfer the molds to the refrigerator and let chill for 8-10 minutes, then remove from the mold and repeat with remaining cheese until all the mozzarella is formed into skulls.",
lswkgj1,t1_lswb37v,1g879fs,"**Ingredients**:

3 ounces prosciutto or speck

8 ounces mozzarella, ciliegine (the small mozzarella balls)

1 cantaloupe¬†

10 small basil leaves

1-2 tablespoons olive oil

1 tablespoon balsamic reduction, or pomegranate molasses, see note

salt, to taste (I used a black lava salt)



**Instructions**:

**For the Mozzarella Skulls**:

Preheat the oven to 350¬∫F and set the silicon molds onto a rimmed baking sheet for stability. Lightly grease the interiors of the skull molds. Add a ball of mozzarella to each skull cavity. Bake for 6-8 minutes to soften the cheese - it will not melt but will become pliable. Use a folded paper napkin to press the softened cheese into the molds (the paper towel will absorb the liquid that is released from the mozzarella, which will be more than you think). Press the cheese well into the molds to get a good form, being careful not to burn yourself. Transfer the molds to the refrigerator and let chill for 8-10 minutes, then remove from the mold and repeat with remaining cheese until all the mozzarella is formed into skulls.



**For the Prosciutto Crisps**:

Lay the prosciutto on a rimmed baking sheet lined with parchment paper. Bake at 350¬∫F along with the mozzarella skulls for 10-15 minutes, or until darkened in color and crisped (they will crisp up more as they cool). Drain on paper towels to cool and absorb excess grease.



**To Assemble the Salad**:

Using a melon baller, scoop balls of cantaloupe and arrange on a plate. Tuck mozzarella skulls in and on top of the melon and then break the prosciutto into pieces and place around and between the melon and cheese. Finally, garnish with basil, salt, and drizzle with olive oil and balsamic reduction. Serve immediately.



**Note**: To make either balsamic or pomegranate reduction, cook 1/4 cup balsamic (or pomegranate) plus 1-2 tablespoons allulose in a small pan and bring to a simmer. Cook until reduced by half and the texture is syrupy. Set aside to cool. Can be made up to a week ahead and kept refrigerated.

You will only use about half the cantaloupe.",

lt2zz2p,t1_lszp8ey,1g879fs,It does make it more salty but crumbling the crispy prosciutto helps keep it in smaller bites and it helps balance the melon and cheese. You can also add a bit less or even skip cooking it.,

ltixnoe,t1_lt6d2eu,1g879fs,"Aww, thank you. It was a week cooking theme on the 52 weeks of cooking sub. And my family was happy to eat it all. :) It was a lot of fun to make them. As for the eggs, here is how: 

‚Ä¢¬†Place the eggs in medium saucepan, cover with 1 inch of water, and bring to boil over high heat. Remove pan from heat, cover, and let sit for 10 minutes. Fill a medium bowl half full with cold water and add 1 tray of ice cubes. Transfer eggs to ice water bath and let sit 5 minutes.  
‚Ä¢¬†Crack the eggs all over with the back of a spoon but leave the shells on. Place into a ziplock bag or glass container full of cold water that is darkly colored with blue food dye. Let stand for at least 1 hour and up to overnight (the lines will get darker and thicker over time - I used 24 hours to get this level of staining).  
‚Ä¢¬†Remove from dye and peel the shell (if it is not as dark as you like, place back into dye and wait more time before trying again).",

It's my wife's signature dish, so I know a good one when I see it. 

She uses venison instead of beef, since it's a little leaner and tends to go well with the pastry. Obviously not a cheap option though.",
m3eaui8,t3_1hkanou,1hkanou,I'm sure it tasted great but someone needs to tell you that you baked it a bit too long. You can see that the pastry is getting to be more cherry brown instead of golden brown. That's why you have that dull grey ring around the tenderloin instead of it being all pink.,

If anyone is aspiring to try and do one of these there's 1 tool that makes it dramatically easier, more reliable & nice; a sous vide machine. Just do the meat up to just shy of rare, sear, wrap & oven.

By the time the pastry is done the meat will be up to medium rare & you'll be good to go.

It's a hard thing to get right. That makes it a lot easier & less likely to have a medium/medium well steak.",

But watched a few other vids/read some recipes and deviated a bit: mainly, I included onion and garlic in the duxelle, added some white wine to the duxelle after the water had evaporated and boiled it off , and used two separate sheets of puff pastry for the base and top rather than rolling it up in one larger sheet (mainly because my fillet was too large for the puff size i had).",

‚Ä¢ Buy all the ingredients
‚Ä¢ Aquire required equipment

Day 1: 
‚Ä¢ Make the duexelles (if using), cool and store in fridge

Day 2: 
‚Ä¢ Season & sear the meat. Rest in fridge for 1-2 hours. Meanwhile‚Ä¶
‚Ä¢ Bring the pate (if using) to room temp
‚Ä¢ Bring duxelles (if using) to room temp
‚Ä¢ defrost the phyllo sheets
‚Ä¢ Lay out the phyllo-prosciutto layer
‚Ä¢ Assemble your proto-Wellington
‚Ä¢ Wrap in plastic wrap to form shape
‚Ä¢ Rest in fridge 2 hours to overnight

Day 3
‚Ä¢ defrost puff pastry 
‚Ä¢ roll pastry flat to fit the roast
‚Ä¢ remove plastic wrap from proto-Wellington 
‚Ä¢ encase in puff pastry, wrap in plastic and chill -
‚Ä¢ Rest in fridge 2 hours to overnight

Day 4
‚Ä¢ allow to come to room temp 1 hour
‚Ä¢ decorate, egg wash, etc
‚Ä¢ bake
‚Ä¢ rest (~45 min) 
‚Ä¢ serve

Yeah, I prepared it the day before and put it in the fridge overnight, then I got it out of the fridge at about 2pm and started cooking at about 6.30pm. So it had a good long time to get up to temperature. Then just an egg wash and salt on the top and in it went.",

m3d7h17,t1_m3d79by,1hkanou,Okay!,
m3eik5f,t1_m3d79by,1hkanou,Because you didn‚Äôt buy the whole tenderloin. Or if you did he kept the section that was for the most part the same thickness so it cooks evenly.  If the smaller end wasn‚Äôt removed it would be well done before the thicker segments were medium rare.  If you purchased the whole loin them it should have been included with the rest of it even if it was trimmed off.  Check your receipt and make sure you are getting everything you paid for.,
m3dd3xm,t1_m3dcqut,1hkanou,"Yeah, as I've said in reply to another comment, the bottom was slightly soggier than I'd have liked, to which preparing ahead was probably a contributing factor.

I grew up eating homemade stuff and from places like Rudy‚Äôs most the time, then going to somewhere like Coopers on special occasions. Sure, it‚Äôs more expensive, but there‚Äôs absolutely a difference in quality.

Pumping a grease trap every time it needs it is expensive. Some jurisdictions and building owners may require disposable plates, etc., to keep the grease waste down.

Now, I‚Äôve had bad brisket from some folks, so it‚Äôs obviously not everyone. But cooking brisket in an offset isn‚Äôt rocket science. Start a fire, S&P a prime HEB brisket, and let it cook 8-12hrs. Throw it in a cooler to rest for 3-6 hours, and you will be eating some awesome food.",

You could buy a cheap choice cut from heb or costco and have a brisket that hopefully isn‚Äôt dry or have a messed up bark by just putting it in an offset and not giving it any attention (which is hard to believe cause you still have to manage your fire since your burning logs in the firebox and keep the smoke clean). Places that the op went to like terry blacks will taste far better because of the effort they put into managing the temperature and keeping their stacks clean. They buy quality cuts from places like snake river. They will aggressively trim their brisket for the sole purpose of insuring that clean smokey flavor evenly penetrates the meat. They do a lot of things to insure they have quality distinct flavors and textures. Long story short thats what you‚Äôre paying all that money for. Alot of work goes into good bbq is all I‚Äôm saying.,

loq9luu,t3_1foi8fr,1foi8fr,"Everyone commenting about the missing raspberry obviously doesn't know Bake Off lore...

OP nailed it!!!",
loq6n1q,t3_1foi8fr,1foi8fr,"Here is the recipe for anyone who wants to try and bake it! 

Ingredient:¬† Chocolate Fudge Cake:¬† 175g Dark Chocolate (54% Cocoa Solids) 150g Unsalted Butter 3 x Eggs 125ml Sour Cream 50ml Vegetable Oil 2 Tsp Vanilla Extract 150g Caster Sugar 150g Soft Brown Sugar 250g Self-Raising Flour 50g Cocoa Powder 1 ¬Ω Tsp Baking Soda ¬º Tsp Salt 125ml Hot Water Dark Chocolate Ganache: ¬†300g Dark Chocolate (54% Cocoa Solids) 450ml Double Cream 25g Unsalted Butter Decoration: 400g Raspberries ¬†

1. Preheat the oven to 180C/350F/Gas Mark 4. Break the dark chocolate into small pieces and cut your butter into cubes. Then in a large mixing bowl add broken dark chocolate and diced butter. Place the mixing bowl over a pan of simmering water (this is a Bain-Marie). Slowly allow the ingredients to melt and mix until the ingredients have been fully incorporated, then remove the bowl from the pan and allow to cool.
2. In another large mixing bowl, add the eggs, sour cream and vegetable oil. Mix until they have become incorporated.
3. Then add the caster sugar and soften brown sugar into the bowl and mix.
4. Once the chocolate-butter mixture has cooled lightly pour it into the wet ingredients and mix until everything has been incorporated.
5. Sieve the self-raising flour, cocoa powder, bicarbonate soda, and salt into the wet ingredients and add the hot water at this point. Fold the dry ingredients into the wet ingredients until there are no lumps in the mixture.
6. Divide the mixture into 2 x 20cm Cake Tins.
7. Bake the Chocolate Fudge Cakes for 35-40 minutes. You can tell the cake is baked when a toothpick is placed into the center and no batter sticks to the toothpick.
8. Once baked leave the Chocolate Fudge Cakes to cool on a wire rack.
9. While the Chocolate Fudge Cakes are cooling, make the Dark Chocolate Ganache.
10. Pour the double cream into a pan and heat until it starts to simmer. Once simmering remove from the heat and allow to cool slightly.
11. Break the dark chocolate up into small pieces and large into a mixing bowl. Once the cream has cooled slightly, pour the cream into the bowl (with the chocolate). Mix until all the chocolate has melted and the ingredients have come together. Leave the Dark Chocolate to cool and thicken.
12. Add the butter and mix until all of the butter has been fully incorporated into the ganache. Leave the Dark Chocolate to cool and thicken.
13. Once the Chocolate Fudge Cakes have cooled, place one onto a cake board and then place some of the Dark Chocolate Ganache on top.
14. Using an off-set spatula spread Dark Chocolate Ganache evenly across the cake.
15. Place another cake layer on top and place more Dark Chocolate Ganache evenly across the cake. Again, using an off-set spatula spread Dark Chocolate Ganache evenly across the cake.
16. Spread Dark Chocolate Ganache around the side of the cake and smoothen the ganache using a bench scraper.
17. Finally add the raspberries on top of the cake and make sure to leave one raspberry off the top of the cake to make it perfectly replicate the Bake Off Cake!",

The carrot cheese ball I did dry out the carrot and cashew to give it more of a crust since the design was pretty straightforward. 

The only one with food coloring was the spider (only on the sliced almond crust) and that was an early one, so I learned quick to stay away from that since it got everywhere and people generally did not eat as much. 

The more natural ingredients, the better they looked and the more people ate!",
lpn6o0j,t1_lpn58ti,1fsu222,"Great question! 

After much experimenting, I have found that a good cheeseball needs to be mixed in the kitchen aid stand mixer on a high speed to ensure a.) all of the ingredients are well distributed and b.) the cream cheese gets an airy fluffiness to it. 

All of the ingredients (except the cream cheese) are run through the food processor for about thirty seconds until you have small chunks.

The ingredients I generally use are:

2 blocks of cream cheese

3/4 bag of pepperoni

1ish cup of sharp cheddar

Green onion

Little tiny bit of olive oil (you can use an infused olive oil if you are feeling fancy)

 (I don‚Äôt always salt the cheese ball itself since the wheat thins will have plenty of salt on them)

Secret ingredient: basil pesto that I make with basil from my garden. You can use store bought basil pesto and it works great!

Edit: be stealthy with the pesto, it can overwhelm the flavor, so make sure you only add enough for people to question what the flavor actually is. Otherwise it will be a pesto ball.

The crust can be whatever you want! I usually go for a cashew, pistachio or almond crust.",

lj8qtk5,t3_1exvpjb,1exvpjb,"# Garlic Parmesan Chicken Pasta

Sort of like the creamy, garlicky cousin to classic Chicken Parmesan. This recipe features panko and parmesan coated chicken breast, drizzled with garlic butter and served over a bed of creamy garlic parmesan pasta with arugula. Additionally, just the pasta on its own is a great option for a simple, delicious meal! 

**Original recipe link:**¬†[Garlic Parmesan Chicken Pasta](https://www.craftycookbook.com/garlic-parmesan-chicken-pasta/)

**Ingredients:**  
*For Parmesan Crusted Chicken:*

* 12-16 oz boneless skinless chicken breast
* 1 oz good quality parmesan cheese, finely grated (about ¬Ω cup per batch)
* ¬º cup panko bread crumbs
* \~2 teaspoon baking soda (optional, for tenderizing the chicken)
* 1 tablespoon olive oil, for pan frying
* salt
* fresh cracked black pepper

*For Garlic Parmesan Pasta:*

* 8 oz dried short pasta (I use ziti or casarecce)
* 2 cups baby arugula, packed
* 2 oz good quality parmesan cheese, finely grated (about 1 cup per batch)
* 1 ¬º cup half-and-half (or use half milk, half cream)
* 2 tablespoon butter, thinly sliced
* 2 tablespoon freshly minced garlic (use more or less as desired)
* 1 teaspoon corn starch
* freshly ground black pepper
* salt to taste

*For Garlic Butter Sauce:*

* 2 tablespoon butter
* 2 teaspoon freshly minced garlic
* 1 teaspoon fresh thyme leaves, optional

**Instructions:**

*Make the parmesan crusted chicken:*

1. Fillet the chicken breast(s) and pound to a thin, even thickness.
2. *Optional step, tenderize chicken*: Dust the chicken with baking soda on both sides. Let sit for 15 minutes, then rinse the baking soda off with water. Pat chicken breasts dry, then continue.
3. Season chicken all over with salt and pepper. On a shallow plate, combine the panko and shredded parmesan. Firmly press the breasts into the mixture, coating both side.
4. Warm a generous swirl of olive oil in a pan over medium-high heat. Cook the chicken, turning once, until golden and cooked through, about 3-4 minutes per side.
5. Set aside and tent with foil to keep warm. Wipe pan clean to prepare the sauce.

*Make the garlic parmesan pasta:*

1. Bring a large pot of salted water to a boil for the pasta. Once boiling, cook the pasta per package instructions for al dente.
2. Meanwhile, combine the corn starch and half-and-half and mix until fully dissolved. The corn starch helps to prevent the sauce from breaking.
3. As the pasta cooks, melt the butter in a skillet over medium low heat in a large skillet. Once melted, add the garlic and some fresh black pepper and cook until very fragrant, about 1 minute.
4. Add the corn starch and half-and-half mixture to the skillet with the butter and mix to combine. Let that come to a simmer over medium heat, then remove the skillet from heat and add the cheese, stirring frequently.
5. Add salt to taste, it will need at least an ‚Öõth teaspoon per batch. If needed, add a little more half-and-half (or sub milk or water) to reduce the thickness of the sauce.
6. Add the drained pasta and arugula to the skillet and mix until they're fully coated.

*Finish the dish:*

1. Melt the butter for the garlic butter (I do this in the microwave) then mix in the garlic and thyme.
2. Slice the chicken breast as shown.
3. Plate the pasta into serving dishes. Top with the chicken pieces, then drizzle the garlic butter over the chicken. Serve immediately.

**Notes**

* You can skip the baking soda step if desired, but this tenderizes the chicken and makes it nearly impossible to overcook. 
* Skip the chicken and just prepare the pasta with arugula for an easy, quick meal!

Garlic Parmesan Chicken Pasta

Ingredients:
For Parmesan Crusted Chicken:

    340-450 g boneless, skinless chicken breast
    30 g good quality parmesan cheese, finely grated (about 50 g per batch)
    30 g panko bread crumbs
    10 g (about 2 tsp) baking soda (optional, for tenderizing the chicken)
    15 ml (1 tbsp) olive oil, for pan frying
    Salt
    Freshly cracked black pepper

For Garlic Parmesan Pasta:

    225 g dried short pasta (like ziti or casarecce)
    60 g baby arugula (packed)
    60 g good quality parmesan cheese, finely grated (about 100 g per batch)
    300 ml half-and-half (or use half milk, half cream)
    30 g butter, thinly sliced
    2 tbsp freshly minced garlic (use more or less as desired)
    5 g (1 tsp) corn starch
    Freshly ground black pepper
    Salt to taste

For Garlic Butter Sauce:

    30 g butter
    2 tsp freshly minced garlic
    1 tsp fresh thyme leaves (optional)

Instructions:
Make the Parmesan Crusted Chicken:

    Fillet the chicken breast(s) and pound them to a thin, even thickness.
    Optional step: Tenderize the chicken by dusting it with baking soda on both sides. Let it sit for 15 minutes, then rinse the baking soda off with water. Pat the chicken breasts dry.
    Season the chicken with salt and pepper. On a shallow plate, combine the panko and grated parmesan. Firmly press the chicken breasts into the mixture, coating both sides.
    Heat the olive oil in a pan over medium-high heat. Cook the chicken, turning once, until golden and cooked through (about 3-4 minutes per side).
    Set aside and tent with foil to keep warm. Wipe the pan clean to prepare the sauce.

Make the Garlic Parmesan Pasta:

    Bring a large pot of salted water to a boil. Cook the pasta according to the package instructions for al dente.
    While the pasta cooks, dissolve the corn starch in the half-and-half to prevent the sauce from breaking.
    In a large skillet, melt the butter over medium-low heat. Once melted, add the garlic and freshly cracked black pepper, cooking until fragrant (about 1 minute).
    Add the corn starch and half-and-half mixture to the skillet with the butter. Let it simmer over medium heat. Remove from heat and stir in the parmesan cheese.
    Add salt to taste (about ‚Öõ tsp per batch). If the sauce is too thick, add a little more half-and-half, milk, or water.
    Add the drained pasta and arugula to the skillet, mixing until fully coated.

Finish the Dish:

    Melt the butter for the garlic butter (you can do this in the microwave). Stir in the minced garlic and thyme.
    Slice the chicken breast into pieces.
    Plate the pasta in serving dishes, top with the chicken, and drizzle the garlic butter sauce over the chicken. Serve immediately.

Notes:

    The baking soda tenderizes the chicken, but you can skip this step if preferred.
    For a quicker meal, skip the chicken and enjoy the garlic parmesan pasta with arugula on its own!",

Try reducing the heat of your pan a bit if you find the final pieces are burning. Usually that happens when the pan isn‚Äôt fully up to temp initially, but then eventually gets there. Setting your pan and oil to a slightly lower temp and letting it warm up for a bit longer before putting the first pieces in should help with that!",

m801pky,t3_1i4zocb,1i4zocb,"I started grinding our own hamburger a couple of years ago and I will never go back to store ground. Our grocery store sells steak trimmings, so I use those and whatever roast is the cheapest. Usually, it's ground round but sometimes sirloin is on sale. Steakburgers are YUM>

also love to make homemade breakfast sausage.

If you're thinking about buying a grinder attachment for your Kitchen-Aid, look online and buy a metal one rather than the plastic branded ones. I've broken 2 of the plastic ones, the OEM metal one I bought is going strong.

EDIT TO ADD: I like to grind for many reasons--- my home ground meat never has yellow fat in the pan, it's always clear as can be. I can vary the amount of fat I use, I just eyeball it. A good hamburger needs a decent amount of fat both for flavor and for it to hold together. I usually buy the cheapest large cut of meat on sale, if its super lean I just use more fat. Usually I save $1-2 per pound over store ground meat. If somebody wants a medium rare burger, I have no qualms serving one because the chances of my ground having e-coli is virtually nil.  
If I'm going to grind meat I make it worth my time and do about 5 lbs at a time --- I feed 4 adults and that's only a couple three meals. Fresh ground beef is just awesome!",

I bought a Black and Decker food processor as I liked the one my desk partner had and it was sturdy (that desk partner had gotten it as a gift from my now husband but he bought me a Cusineart processor).  The black and decker instructions for meat patties were well written, ice chips, added to mostly frozen 2 inch cubes of meat and it turned out well.  I had been using my aluminum hand grinder I had to clamp to the kitchen table as my counters were too thick to clamp it there.  Both turned out really nice burgers.

I decided to try another company, outside of amazon, that is a dedicated organic essential oil site. Recieved it and was like, wtf, this smells like shit.. well maybe not that bad but it wasnt great and didnt even resemble the amazon oil. 





After a bit of digging, i found a guy, not just a guy, but a chemist who independently tested essential oils on amazon with a chromatogram or hplc or whatever it was -an instrument to tell you exactly whats in the oils.... MOSTLY PETROLEUM BASED, with perfumes and some with tiny amounts of actual EOs in them. TONS of the EOs on Amazon are perfumed mineral oil, and mostly derived from Petroleum.

Some tips for any meat grinder though, chill your meat in the freezer for a little while before grinding it. The extra firm-ness from being chilled helps it grind instead of just ripping and tearing (insert Doom meme here).          
Also, feeding a little bit of bread down the grinder after you're done with the meat, helps push out the last little bits of meat, so less is wasted üëç",üëç

No lettuce on mine please. If it's ham from like a bone im ham awesome war with cheese melted on it a miracle whip. I need nothing else.

I won't eat bologna or salami.

If the bread is dense and hard to eat i won't like it. Like that kind of bread before subway existed.

Sandwiches with bacon on it top as long as it's warm yes.

If you cook a chuck roast until ultra tender and falling apart. Awesome with some miracle whip on it. Including some cooked up onion and peppers i would throw in one with some mushrooms.

Carrots won't touch my roast. Potatoes might if making no grevy and mashed.

I do chuck roast 3 ways. Slow cooker, iron pot in oven or pressure cooker. Adding veggies i use when mostly done so they are not all the way soggy. Then i remove any extra grease if too much and mix a few heaping tablespoons of flour and cornstarch into a quart jar. Fill with water almost half way but not too full. Put lid on and shake for a good while. Get your liquid drippings boiling and slowly pore in.

Also cooking roast in pressure cooker or in oven i flour them but first stir in seasonings in the flour bowl i use. Then brown all sides on high heat before adding liquid to keep from drying out. Then let it cook / boil with the lid on in the oven.

Leftovers make good sandwiches and i normally make two chuck roast for our family.

Better than roast beef lunch meat any day of this or last century. That's why this is beef roast and not roast beef. Not even the same thing.

Should be falling apart where a fork can't take it out without it falling apart. I remove the meat and veggies with a slotted spoon. Sometimes a fork gets it out or a couple forks.

Anyway roast beef lunch meat is crappy in comparison. Not any better than any other lunch meat. The same if you buy from the store or Arby's. Different product. Different texture. Different seasons and flavors.

Rule of thumb for me. Garlic powder or gloves or minced. As long as you add garlic. Then some Onion powder and i drop a tiny bit of cumin in it. even though you add onions i still add onion powder you take out to eat on the side with other veggies. I add some other seasonings. That's just the min added most necessary for me. Don't add too much cumin you will add more of the other stuff. Don't use garlic salt. It's too much salt. Mostly salt. There is a cheap seasoning mix i add too it but hard to find because only some stores carry it. Mix ground black peppercorn in it too. Pre ground or the do work to grind kind. Doesn't matter.

Usually cook a can good veggie on the side too.",

Dining room class would then serve the produced food. If you were culinary and stuck serving you got to eat first. If you were dining room students you got to eat last and finish the wines. Left overs weren't usually a problem, but what little was left would go to students.

Some classes wouldn't produce food for dining room, in which case everything was eaten by the students in that class and if there was any leftovers you could take it home/to the dorms.

I sprinkled the rest on top of the cake, arranged the frozen skulls on top, and baked it for about 45 minutes.

The skulls held their shape, and it was way better than just eating the loaf as directed by the box!

ETA: For those asking about the skull molds - they were $9 on Amazon, and came as a set of two with a dropper thing for liquid fillings. The automod deletes when I try to share a link. Sorry!",

lmalbd1,t1_lmai71h,1fc2hky,"Coffee is very popular in the UK and has been for centuries, for context in the 1730s london already had more than twice as many coffee houses as there are currently branches of starbucks in london. 

Coffee flavoured cakes are very common, for example, [https://www.nigella.com/recipes/coffee-and-walnut-layer-cake](https://www.nigella.com/recipes/coffee-and-walnut-layer-cake)

if you asked for a coffee cake in the uk, you would receive a coffee flavoured cake with coffee in it, usually espresso or instant coffee. 

Regarding tea cakes, this has several meanings in the UK. 

tunnocks tea cakes = small dome shaped confectionary consisting of a cracker/biscuit layer, marshmallow and covered with chocolate [https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/afe2e3719e81e5a5da0d0319d1e31347fb95dcd4/0\_78\_4616\_2771/master/4616.jpg?width=1200&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=8928d1dba951b1b042662c78eeded058](https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/afe2e3719e81e5a5da0d0319d1e31347fb95dcd4/0_78_4616_2771/master/4616.jpg?width=1200&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=8928d1dba951b1b042662c78eeded058)

Tea cake (in west yorkshire specifically) = a white bread roll/bun (e.g. a hambuger bun could be referred to as a tea cake) [https://www.krustyloaf.co.uk/uploads/1/2/1/9/121956813/krusty-loaf-white-roll\_orig.png](https://www.krustyloaf.co.uk/uploads/1/2/1/9/121956813/krusty-loaf-white-roll_orig.png) 

tea cake (rest of uk) = an enriched bread dough bun with dried fruit. typically served toasted with butter. [https://c02.purpledshub.com/uploads/sites/47/2019/05/Toasted-Teacake-7a41399.jpg](https://c02.purpledshub.com/uploads/sites/47/2019/05/Toasted-Teacake-7a41399.jpg)",

Churro Style Waffles

Notes:
* Prepare the melted butter and cinnamon sugar before you start the waffles to save time.¬†
* To save even more time, you can use any of your favorite waffle mix such as ""Krusteaz waffle mix"". Make as box instructs then follow recipe starting with step 7.
* Some prefer to dip each side the cooked waffle in the butter OR use a basting brush to put butter on all sides of the waffle. I used the brush.¬†

Waffles: (skip if using waffle mix)
2 cups flour
‚Öì cup white granulated sugar
3¬Ω teaspoons baking powder
¬æ teaspoon salt
2 teaspoons ground cinnamon
2 large eggs separate whites and yolks
2 cups whole milk
¬Ω cup vegetable oil
1 teaspoon pure vanilla extract

Cinnamon Sugar coating:
1 stick unsalted butter¬†
1 cup granulated sugar
3-4 teaspoons ground cinnamon


Instructions:¬†

1. Heat up waffle iron according to instructions. You want the waffle to be crispy on the outside and soft on the inside.¬†

2. In a large bowl, add dry ingredients: flour, sugar, baking powder, salt, and cinnamon. Whisk together until combined. Set aside.

3. In a medium bowl, add oil, egg yolks, milk, and vanilla extract. Whisk together to combine. Add to dry ingredients and whisk together until just combined (don't over mix).¬†

4. In yet another bowl, beat the left over egg whites on high speed until soft peaks form. Fold egg whites in to waffle batter with soft spatula until combined.¬†

5. Spray nonstick spray on to both sides waffle iron when it's preheated and you're ready to pour in the batter. Add batter to waffle iron and cook according to the¬† instructions with the waffle iron. I start pouring in the middle and slowly work to the outside making sure I have enough to make it to the edge but won't overflow once you close the iron.¬†

6. While the waffle is cooking, melt butter in microwave or stove top then put in a shallow dish or bowl (shallow dish is best for dipping). In another dish, add 3-4 tsp cinnamon and 1 cup of white granulated sugar and whisk together until both incorporated.¬†

7. Let waffle cool for about a minute before coating the outside with melted butter. At this point I separated the triangles but you can keep the waffle whole if you wish.¬†

8. Brush melted butter on all sides of the waffle triangle and shake off excess butter as best as you can then place in the shallow cinnamon sugar dish. Work relatively quick to flip to other sides to coat in the sugar and gently shake off excess if needed. Place on cooling rack and repeat with other waffles.

9. Put one triangle in a small bowl, add scoop (or more) of vanilla ice cream, put another triangle on top of the ice cream then drizzle with some caramel, melted chocolate, etc.¬†

Great way to use the waffles to make for ice cream sandwiches or to dip triangles in caramel or melted chocolate",

The grandparents lived in the house with his parents and sister, all entrepreneurs. 

His grandfather taught me how to make gochujang and jarred it. They had three plots in the back, in which the jars were buried. 

1 was for everyday use and was aged for 6 months. 

Another was for guests and big dinners and was aged for a year.

lj5sx8v,t1_lj47fri,1ewvxyr,It's a specific type of rice. It's called glutinous rice.,
lj63ocv,t1_lj47fri,1ewvxyr,"Rice in pan, water in pan, lid on, bring water to boil on high heat, when boiling turn heat right down (never remove lid), 10-12 mins or until water is all gone, check for texture, can leave it there without heat until everything else is finished - I‚Äôve found it gets ‚Äòstickier‚Äô if you leave it.

Never stir it at basically any point in this process.

A word of warning - since you‚Äôre not stirring it‚Äôs easier to burn it at the bottom, it makes for some really awful washing up. 

It‚Äôs also recommended to let the rice soak for a few hours in water before",

lj59hxn,t1_lj4rbsn,1ewvxyr,"Mixing them is a great plan of attack.  So is a bite of one and then a bite of the other.  The presentation here isn't quite how it would be done in Korea, at least traditionally.  Typically, you would get a small bowl of rice, and everything else would come on its own serving plate at the center of the table, and you'd get whatever you want and bring it to your bowl of rice to be eaten together in one bite, or separately.

lxy1wbr,t1_lxx0qex,1gul9b3,"That's debatable. It depends on what quality you want your dishes at. I'd probably argue that most of the prep in butter chicken is from straining out the sauce after blending, because I personally hate the tomato skin and seeds in the sauce. In this case, veg prep for me is just boiling each of the vegetables after one or two rough cuts and that's the easy part. You could cut smaller and then saute them out, but again that's your decision. Blend, pour back, cook, cook chicken, etc. It's not really as 'easy mode' as you make it sound, but you can simplify it just as you can with any recipe. At the end of the day, it's mostly your preference for quality that determines the amount of prep. You can make a really complicated spaghetti and meatballs from scratch that takes an hour of prep, or you can make the same thing in about 10 mins in one pot. It's really your preference and I don't think it's fair to say it's any easier or harder than other dishes. It's worth just making it and seeing what you like about it and adjusting to your preference, whether that be from a timing perspective or taste perspective.",

lxxyech,t1_lxxwgdo,1gul9b3,"I think that's appropriate for daily home cooking, but if you want the actual 'butter' taste in butter chicken you probably need to double that, otherwise it's just somewhere in between tasting like tikka masala and butter chicken depending on your quantity of tomatoes/onions. A lot of butter chicken recipes are too tangy to be butter chicken imo, it's closer to tikka masala. Ranveer Brar's recipe is probably the best I've seen and tried, and he uses about 4 tbsp alongside additional ghee and it's probably the only recipe I've tried that tastes like 'butter' chicken.",
lxvntwx,t1_lxvkgqe,1gul9b3,You're almost certainly right. Normally a paste of ginger and garlic is used but here OP has separate cloves of garlic.,

lxvpij8,t1_lxvnyn2,1gul9b3,No I don‚Äôt think that‚Äôs right. What about mace?,
lxwhzc2,t1_lxviv5c,1gul9b3,My girl Nagi knows what's up!,
lxw8bwx,t1_lxvlmnb,1gul9b3,An air fryer is just a convection oven. I wish full size convection ovens were cheaper. They cook much better than standard ovens.,

lxw1p02,t1_lxvgoee,1gul9b3,It‚Äôs definitely one of the most predominant flavors,

lxxn3o4,t1_lxxjs04,1gul9b3,We use it for chicken thighs and potatoes fairly regularly and it works pretty well,
ly2bqka,t1_lxxn3o4,1gul9b3,Well that's not exactly a glowing endorsement... maybe I'll wait for GE Caf√© 2 Oven Boogaloo,
ly2chdk,t1_ly2bqka,1gul9b3,I guess I don‚Äôt know what I‚Äôm comparing to. I actually get crispy chicken skin on marinated chicken thighs. It‚Äôs delicious! We are super pleasantly surprised. Our expectations were nothing and we really enjoy it. Probably still not helpful,

ljp9iig,t1_ljp7p4c,1f02eyu,"Thank you! They were really good and super easy. I just used the ancient grain dough from Whole Foods. I let the dough sit room temp covered for a few hours first. For the pepperoni Detroit style I layered the dough with a ton of mozz edge to edge in the deep dish pan, an entire bag of pepperoni and baked it at 500 for about 15 min. Took it out then topped it with warmed up pizza sauce, basil, Parm. Done. The plain I just did the same thing except constructed the pizza normally and baked together with the Pepperoni.",

The earliest known recipes for shepherd‚Äôs pie do not specify any meat. If it was so crucial to be linked to the idea of shepherd = sheep product then it would have named a sheep product as being critical to the dish. Instead it reads ‚Äòtake cold dressed meat of any kind, roast or boiled‚Äô. Another about 20 years later, ‚Äòcut up scraps of cold meat‚Äô. Another 9 years later ‚Äòtake cold roast beef, mutton or veal‚Ä¶‚Äô.

The name however is not a nod to the ingredients, but rather the construction of the dish. The common theme that runs through these early recipes that makes them different from today‚Äôs recipes is that they are all using leftover meat. 

That is why it is called a shepherd‚Äôs pie. It is a reworking of leftovers to create a new dish. The frugality of the poor shepherd is what is being invoked.

Edit: the person I am replying to wanted the full recipe.


The Practice of Cookery and Pastry, Adapted to the Business of Every Day Life by Mrs. Williamson (Edinburgh, 1849)

Shepherd‚Äôs Pie. Take cold dressed meat of any kind, roast or boiled. Slice it, break the bones, and put them on with a little boiling water, and a little salt. Boil them until you have extracted all the strength from them, and reduced it to very little, and strain it. Season the sliced meat with pepper and salt, lay it in a baking dish, and pour in the sauce you strained. Add a little mushroom ketchup. Have some potatoes boiled and nicely mashed, cover the dish with the potatoes, smooth it on the top with a knife, notch it round the edge and mark it on the top, the same as paste. Bake it in an oven, or before the fire, until the potatoes are a nice brown.‚Äù",

If it was referring to frugality it should be farmers pie, or workers pie, or peasants pie or country pie something like that. No. They named a pie after people who herd sheep and you want to argue that it isnt related to mutton. You're gonna need more evidence than 'you're wrong'.",

If you quoted my full opening paragraph it starts with ‚Äòfish pie is probably the more common term. I‚Äôve actually never heard of a ‚Äòfisherman‚Äôs pie‚Äô but that doesn‚Äôt mean much. It makes sense that people who believe a shepherd‚Äôs pie needs lamb attach similar labels to these potato pies with different meats in them in an attempt to continue the theme.


Sorry, I should have posted either the full recipe or a source.

This person‚Äôs collaboration of early recipes is a very good source for early shepherd‚Äôs pie instances. *link not allowed*

Your examples of different names for pies could work sure. But they also did have another name ‚Äòcottage pie‚Äô. In the 1800s shepherds were hired farm hands who lived in cottages. They did not own the sheep they looked after. They ate vegetables they grew or occasionally bought and they might have kept a pig. If they were lucky they were gifted a sheep occasionally. 

*** I have a link that describes an 1800s shepherd‚Äôs circumstances but I‚Äôm not allowed to post links in this sub, here is a passage though.***

‚ÄòAs Rev. James Fraser noted in 1867: ‚ÄòTheir cottages are deficient of almost every requisite that would constitute a home for a Christian family in a civilised country.‚Äô Shepherds‚Äô thatched dwellings were usually semi-detached, with two families sharing between four and six rooms.‚Äô

We are removed from this society now, but this was a time of exodus from the countryside to the city. Maybe the countryside and the workers who remained were romanticised and looked upon as people who although poor lived a simple and frugal life. People who turn their leftovers into a new dish.",

A shepherd‚Äôs wife from Blandford described her family‚Äôs diet in 1867: ‚ÄòWe live on potatoes, bread and, sometimes, pig meat‚Ä¶. We sometimes sit down to dry bread. We never have a bit of milk.‚Äô They were lucky to get the ‚Äòpig meat‚Äô. The shepherd would normally monopolise the family‚Äôs bacon, leaving the rest with bread, tea and potatoes and maybe some dripping.‚Äô",

lp28qhp,t1_lp18nss,1fpyr5i,"# Cinnamon Rolls

## Dough
- 240g warm whole milk (get it to ~100¬∞-110¬∞F, microwave 60-70 seconds works)
- 100g white granulated sugar
- 2 1/4 tsp instant yeast
- 75g almost melted butter
- 1 whole egg
- 2 egg yolks- 220g bread flour- 265g all-purpose flour 
- 1 tsp salt

## Filling
- 220g dark brown sugar
- 2 tbsp ground cinnamon (~15g)
- 80g (~1/3 cup) softened butter

## Frosting
- 115g softened cream cheese
- 60g softened butter
- 1 vanilla bean (split and scrape the seeds from inside) or ~1-2 tbsp vanilla extract 
- 250g powdered sugar
- pinch of salt
- 45g whole milk

## Oven config
- 375¬∞ preheated, bake for 15-20 minutes (my oven, personally 16.5 mins was ideal)

1. Dissolve sugar in warmed milk, then sprinkle the yeast over the milk. Let sit for about 15 minutes.

2. Add almost melted butter, egg and yolks, and salt.

3. Gradually add in the flour while stirring with a spatula, until a shaggy dough begins to form.

4. Knead the dough until it becomes smooth and elastic, tacky but not sticky. It will be tough to work by hand, this dough is dense and heavy. It may take a while.

5. Shape into a ball, place into greased bowl and cover with plastic food film. Let rise for 1.5-2 hours or til it roughly doubles in size.

6. Transfer dough to floured surface. Gently press out the air, then roll out into a rectangle, to about 1/4"" in thickness. I don't have a rolling pin so I just used something cylindrical. I like to use a bench scraper to trim off the uneven sides so that the dough is as uniform as possible ‚Äî it makes for a nicer roll.

7. Spread the butter all over the dough. ALL OVER THE DOUGH. The butter should be spread end to end, top to bottom, cover all of it.

8. In a bowl, whisk together the brown sugar and cinnamon so that it becomes uniform and mixed well. Then sprinkle it over top the butter-covered dough. Use your fingers and rub it gently to ensure every inch is covered.

9. Begin by tightly rolling up the dough into a nice, careful roll, then gradually end with a pushing-style motion once everything is nice and tight. Go wash your hands and turn the oven on to preheat to 375¬∞.

10. Use a bench scraper to swiftly and forcibly slice into ~3"" rolls. Or whatever size you like. I like them on the smaller size. Ideally, you would want to use unwaxed floss to cinch the dough for an absolute clean slice without smushing the roll, but I didn't have any and can barely stop myself from eating the dough raw as it is, so I don‚Äôt have time for that.

11. Line a rimmed sheet pan with parchment paper or silicon baking mat. Transfer the individual cinnamon rolls to sheet pan, keep them tight and touching.

12. Bake in the 375¬∞ preheated oven for 15-20 minutes. Check it at 16 minutes, my oven personally, 16.5 mins is ideal.

13. While the rolls are baking, get an appropriate sized bowl for the frosting and to it add the cream cheese, butter, and salt. Use a hand mixer to whip together, then add the milk.

14. Gradually add the powdered sugar while continuing to mix the frosting.

15. Once well combined, split the vanilla bean down the middle with a paring knife, then use the blunt side to scrape the inside (the seeds) into the frosting and mix it in.

16. Go get the baked rolls, remove from oven, explode with frosting and enjoy.",

The best recipe that I suggest to you is to buy a farmer o very fresh tomatos and iceberg salad, a good quality prosciutto and mozzarella, add a little bit of salt and pepper on the mozzarella is the easiest you can do but the tastiest in IMO.

Your post is inspiring, of course I started rhyming. It's like a defense mechanism. Cause I really want to eat this, but also it's already been eaten. And I'm jealous.

Edit: can't even bring myself to look at the next post on reddit under yours. Cause if I scroll down I will lose this image forever and I want to keep it close to my stomach. I mean heart......",

¬†HOW TO MAKE THE RECIPE¬† ¬†

Chicken Marinade¬†¬†

¬†Cube chicken to 1 to 1¬Ω inch pieces. Add them to a mixing bowl. Make sure there is no excess moisture in your chicken. If you want you may pat dry with a few kitchen tissues.¬†¬†

Add red chilli powder, garam masala, cumin powder, coriander powder, turmeric, salt, lemon juice, oil, ginger garlic paste, yogurt and kasuri methi. Skip the lemon juice if your yogurt is sour. Mix well.¬†

Cover with a cling wrap and refrigerate for minimum of 8 hours and up to 48 hours. If you are in a rush, you may cut down to 3 hours.

¬†Make Tikka Sauce¬†

Heat oil or ghee in a pot or pan. Add onions and sprinkle 1 teaspoon salt. Saute until deep golden. Add ginger garlic paste and green chilli. Saute until aromatic, for 40 to 60 seconds. Reduce the heat to low. Add red chilli powder, coriander powder, garam masala and cumin powder. Stir well quickly. Add the tomatoes and cook on a medium high heat until the onion tomato masala becomes really thick. (If using fresh tomatoes, it takes about 7 to 8 mins and tomato puree/passata takes only 2 minutes)¬†

Pour hot water and mix well. Bring to a rolling boil and cover. Simmer until thick, for about 12 to 14 mins.¬†

Optional¬†- Cool down and blend to a smooth puree. Return it to the pot and heat up. This step cuts down the acidity from canned tomatoes.¬†



¬†How to Make Chicken¬†Tikka Masala¬†

Grill in Oven :¬†While the gravy simmers, thread the chicken to the metal skewers or soaked bamboo skewers and place them in a prepared tray. Bake them in a preheated oven at 460 F or 240 C for 9 to 10 mins. Turn them to the other side with a tong and grill then for another 9 to 10 mins. To char the chicken, broil for 2 to 3 mins or until slightly charred.¬†¬†

Or In a Skillet:¬†Pour 1 tbsp oil to a skillet and heat it well. Place the chicken tikka one by one, spacing them apart. Cook on a medium high heat for 3 mins, turn them to the other side with a tong and cook for another 3 mins, until charred and not essentially fully cooked. Remove to a plate and Cook in batches.¬†

Or In the Air fryer:¬†Thread on skewers and place them in the basket or in the tray. Air fry for 6 mins, at 400 F or 200 C. Turn them with tongs and air fry for another 6 mins. If they dry out, you may baste with marinade and continue for another 2 mins, until slightly charred. After 12 to 14 mins of simmering the tikka masala sauce, add sugar and the cream (or cashew cream, check notes to make your own). Stir well and cook for a few minutes until thick, creamy and aromatic. (Check video for consistency)¬†

Add the grilled chicken tikka and crushed kasuri methi. (Make sure your gravy has reached a thick gravy consistency/serving consistency, before adding chicken). Stir and cook for 2 to 3 mins until chicken tikka is soft and tender. Taste test and add more salt, garam masala and sugar if needed. Turn off and garnish with cream and coriander leaves. Serve chicken tikka masala with Butter Naan, roti, paratha, Basmati rice or Jeera rice. (Working on formatting)",

The one I always use is the chicken tikka masala recipe by Swasthi on indianhealthyrecipes.com. 

It apparently has a lot of ads, which I was not aware of, because I have Adblockers on everything. 
Consequently I cannot share the link directly. I‚Äôll put the recipe in a child comment because it‚Äôs long.

 [for naan at home, I turn to manjula](https://youtu.be/9Be9LHPracE) 

If you want the chicken tikkas to feel more authentic and are okay with a lot of effort (seriously, when I make this, I put a cumulative 6+ hours into it), I put them all on skewers, then have the skewers on top of a Pyrex/similar glassware in the oven, put a little water at the bottom of said glassware to stop the drippings from burning on, and the steam keeps the skewers moist and tender. I cook it at around 500F for 15-20 minutes. The chicken comes out incredibly tender. It‚Äôs a whole *process* when I make tikka masala. So I end up making a ton every time to have leftovers. 

Last time I made enough to freeze it in quart freezer ziploc bags. Smells a little weird cooking it again later (my roommate literally messaged me ‚Äúthis smells like a fart‚Äù when he cooked it), but it otherwise came out just fine ‚Ä¶ I really love tikka masala",

Everyone else understands what they are.

I've actually had this sandwich from this exact place. The restaurant does NOT call it a banh mi either. They call it a Sando, which is just short for sandwich. That's it. For what it's worth, I also loved it the first time and it was a novelty for me. The second time it felt like a bit ""much"", chicken too greasy and curry too overwhelming. I haven't had it again.

Pate is often ignored even at *authentic* places.  Butter vs mayo vs other is a hodgepodge. Cilantro is near universal, but maybe not quite. 

Idk. I'd call this definitively a banh mi if it includes pickled veg and jalapeno. At least by US standards. Language is variable, though. A fried chicken breast sandwich is a burger in much of the world, but it's not a burger in the US.",

lrmrnu4,t3_1g2acu7,1g2acu7,"Disclaimer: I didn't follow an exact recipe I just watched a whole bunch of different videos and then took bits from each and used what I had. This recipe made 8 pieces of naan.

Dough:

1/3 cup plain yoghurt (I used lactose free yoghurt and that worked well)

1 pack dry yeast

1/2 cup warm water

1 tbsp oil

1 tsp sugar

2 1/2 cups flour

Pinch of salt

Garlic butter (just winged this part):

Garlic 3 tbsp (just put as much as I wanted)

A chunk of butter

Dried parsley 

Instructions:
1) Place dry yeast and warm water in a bowl for 10mins covered with a cloth 
2) Mix yoghurt, oil, salt and yeast together 
3) Add wet ingredients to the flour
4) Knead until well combined
5) Let rest in a lightly oiled bowl to rise for about 1hr (it should double in size)
6) Cut the dough into 8 pieces
7) Roll out until flattened 
8) Lightly oil pan, and put on medium low heat
9) Place dough in pan and wait until bubbles form
10) Flip over until the other side browns as well
11) Plate and brush with garlic butter mixture",

lrp9n8p,t3_1g2acu7,1g2acu7,"As someone who makes Pita/Paratha/Tandoor Roti on regular basis, keep this in mind. 
""The rolling motion of dough is more of a rotation rather than rolling.""

The circular shape comes from rotation, 99% of people don't know this, even those who have been doing it for decades. 
If i can put in other words, put 30% less pressure on the right hand than your left. Given your dough is perfectly hydrated & dusted, it'll rotate & evenly roll giving its natural circular shape. You dont make the shape. 


P.s. controlling cooking temperature is a battle for another day.

lkww1q1,t1_lkv3hzo,1f5oe1u,"Honestly if you've got a good mild curry powder you're pretty much half way to your own home made version. 

Sautee diced carrot, onion, garlic, ginger and potatoes with your choice of oil until they're a lil soft add 2tbsp of flour and 1.5tbsp of curry powder, and cook it out a little.

Add 600ml of chicken stock + 1.5tbsp of soy sauce slowly and then simmer until it thickens. 

You can blend it or leave the veg whole for whatever occasion.

There's also a Thai place that does sushi in addition to the standard Thai stuff, a few places that do American Cantonese stuff and also sushi, a not so good place that does random Thai, Japanese, and Chinese dishes, then there's a place that does Japanese food including Gyudon, Katsudon, curry, and sushi but oddly no ramen",

lwrj91q,t1_lwrfh40,1gp49do,"You can look it up online. There are 2 main methods, pasteurization and sterilization (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sterilization\_(microbiology)?useskin=vector#Foods). You cannot sterilize every food as high heat will modify/destroy the properties of it. Milk usually for instance uses one of these 2 techniques, when it's using UHT you can keep your milf for >6 months, with pasteurization it's around 2 weeks.

You don't need special machinery to sterilize unlike with pasteurization, as pasteurization implies heating and cooling very fast (usually a few seconds) which is not possible in most standard kitchens. However you can sterilize easily, you can find online several ways of doing so (here is an example [https://mesrecettesweck.com/recettes/sauce-bolognaise/](https://mesrecettesweck.com/recettes/sauce-bolognaise/), it's french but it says 2h at 100¬∞C), if it's less than 6 months, 1h-1h30 is enough. it kills everything, bacteria, fungi...

And to do so I've been using repurposed glass jars (jam or pickles). It's very similar to the process of making homemade jam. BTW when you clean your jars you have to do it with a dishwasher at high heat, if you don't have one, I suggest that after cleaning them, you boil them for \~30mins to kill any remaining bacteria.

Edit: Forgot to add that it works very well with bolognaise as boiling the jar will not modify its properties that much. Most foods will not work that well. It also works even better with tomato sauce.",
lws7kl6,t1_lwrfh40,1gp49do,"Boiling water will not be effective against botulism. It inactivates the toxin, so it's a good idea to boil old soups and such before eating, but assuming the goal is to remove Clostridium botulinum when canning, that's not what you want to do.

Its spores can survive basically indefinitely in 100 ¬∞C. It's recommended to heat the mass to 121 ¬∞C for 3 minutes to inactivate them. You need a pressurized vessel for this, otherwise your water will not heat above a 100 ¬∞C. Put some water in a pressure cooker, put in the sealed jars, and you can look up what pressure corresponds to 121 ¬∞C. You can use a pressure cooker to make some extra special dishes too, so it wouldn't be a single-purpose gadget.

All this is not necessary if you are canning something acidic (like fruit compote or jam), really sugary (like compote or jam), or very (5-10%) salty (pickled vegetables). C. botulinum is one of the most hardy pathogens regularly in kitchens, but dislikes those conditions. If you don't have to worry about that specific strain (for the record, it would be a risk with bolognese sauce) a 100 ¬∞C usually achieved during initial cooking, along with a clean working area and care will take care of other potential germs. Clean your jars in the dishwasher and/or the microwave, don't touch the inside, don't leave the lid off and the jar open to the air, and can while everything is still hot.",

All of it 

Thats gonna take some typing 

Trimmed, seasoned and smoked the beef ribs for about 7 hours until they were nice and tender 

Then chopped them up 

Made a fresh guacamole, whole avocado, herbs and spices, little lemon, lime and garlic 

Then I made a simple tomato salsa, with lots of fresh coriander, garlic, salt, pepper and cumin 

The salsa verde was a heap of green tomato relish, spring onion, coriander and flat leaf parsley, white onion, garlic, salt, pepper, lemon and lime, blitzed up 

Mexican rice was just a basic rice, cooked down with Mexican seasoning 

Then I just put the whole lot together, warm tortilla, then the guacamole, rice, beef ribs, salsa, verde, more beef rib, and a tiny bit of crumbled feta

However, I understand its value, particularly for agricultural workers needing the additional carbs.  Here‚Äôs a great quote I found in the [Mission Burrito](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mission_burrito?wprov=sfti1#History) entry on Wikipedia.

> Freezing cold five AM mornings, the best time to pick lettuce, owners needed a very good cook to attract the best fast crews. We'd get huevos rancheros at five, sweet strong hot coffee with a shot of brandy at seven, then full spicy killer burritos at around 10:30, keep you going till afternoon. I remember the texture of the shredded beef, the heat of the green peppers, and the proper proportion of rice and beans. They were so spicy you didn't need salsa ‚Äì but you needed that protein and fiber, couldn't survive without it.

The only major difference is I use skin on, bone in, thighs which I debone myself. I sprinkle the seasoning only on the meat side, and then wrap them with their own skin into tight little packages. Pat dry, salt the top/skin side, and leave uncovered in the fridge for a few hours. Then start them topside/skin side down in a cold SS pan over medium heat until the skin releases, flip em on all sides to brown the rest of the skin. Take em to like 155 internal, remove & continue recipe, and then add back in for final 10-15 mins of cooking. They should finish at like 175-180 internal, and be nice and moist

Hope that helps

lqxrouf,t1_lqw2tiw,1fykuwx,"Orzo is a shape of pasta. In Italy it is called more frequently ""risoni"" which means ""big rice"" because it indeed resembles the shape of  a grain of rice.

The reason why here in Italy it is not usually called ""orzo"" is that ""orzo"" in Italian means ""barley"" (a kind of grain) and we use ""true"" barley to make soups as well, but clearly it is cooked quite differently.",

lqwxsws,t1_lqwebkc,1fykuwx,"Proteins and collagen in chicken thighs need to be cooked to at least 175¬∞F (79¬∞C) to break down into tenderer gelatin, which helps to retain moisture

Edit: I had someone message and ask why it doesn't dry out when taken to that temp. When you take thighs to 175-180, that breaking down of the collagen essentially self-bastes your chicken thighs, from the inside, for that melt in your mouth texture. They will not be dried and tough, trust.",

Which has some legitimacy, since it was created by a Turk...living in Germany and it gained huge popularity in Germany and was a common fast food in Germany before it ever spread to Turkey or other nations. No German would ever dispute that it's a food with turkish culture background, but the situation is also a little bit funny, because the facts are known but emotionally disputed by Turks while it seems most Germans don't care much but rather enjoy teasing their turkish friends with this.

I'm not saying that at all to hate on D√∂ner, I love D√∂ner and eat it multiple times per month, but it is what it is. There is a reason why D√∂ner Shops can't call their D√∂ner ""D√∂ner"" anymore, but ""Drehspie√ü"", because D√∂ner needs a minimum amount of regular (not minced) meat in it which isn't met by the big (monopoly wise) D√∂ner meat producers.

lqsm82v,t1_lqsci8p,1fxeook,Depends on the sauce. The basic sauce is pretty easy to make yourself and other sauces are not that much harder. The only hard part would be to get good meat and still have appropriate pricing. D√∂ner is streetfood so it‚Äôs always a thin line to make it profitable.,

Your minimum wage is half of what we have in Germany.  
I lived for a few years in TX btw, I know what I'm talking about. The wage that was offered for the job (engineering leadership position) sounded very nice compared to the wage in Germany, but after health insurance, unpaid leave in US compared to paid vacation days in Germany, housing and cost of living there was less disposable income left in the USA than in Germany.

lbdybak,t3_1dtlnqa,1dtlnqa,"Ethiopian goes so hard. Definitely not as popular as it should be IMO. I think it's just so different than what western people are used to that it just hasn't grown in popularity, at least where I am. I think the issue is that there isn't something people can latch onto and understand what it is. Indian food and Asian food typically have rice or noodles which people know, but when you get some Ethiopian food you just don't know what is going on at all, for instance in the picture I recognize eggs and that salad in the middle looks familiar (though I wouldn't be surprised if it tastes drastically different that what I'd expect), and the injera, but I only know the injera because I was taken by an Ethiopian person, I had to google the spelling. 

It really is a completely different food that is well worth going out of your way to experience. I guarantee that you will taste some of it that you absolutely love and probably find some stuff you really can't stand... just like with food from anywhere else I guess.

Similar to how burgers is a comfort food for most people, sourdough bread is my childhood comfort food.  Injera (the rolled up flat bread in the picture) is a sourdough flatbread.  Just as I love dipping sourdough bread in thick lentil soup or clam chowder, Ethiopian food gives a similar sort of comfort, but with more flavor and imo is a bit more enjoyable.

If you haven't had it.  Go try some.  It's not as scary as it might first appear to be.  It's great for groups.  It's fun to introduce people to it.

The veggies in the picture are lentils, collard greens, beans (I think.), cauliflower and carrots, and salad.  The meat in the picture is chicken (with a boiled egg), beef, and maybe some goat / lamb, it's hard to tell.",

lbax1g8,t1_lbao8rz,1dtlnqa,"(Ignoring the second platter at the top of the picture because everything on it is also on the main platter.)

Very center: salad. Usually just chopped lettuce, tomato, and onion in a lemon dressing. Refreshing to eat between bites of the heavier stews (wots).

Inner ring, clockwise starting at the top: kitfo (traditionally, raw minced beef, but this looks like it's been cooked a bit, and served here with cheese on the side), minchet abish (a minced beef stew), key wot (spicy beef stew), two kinds of doro wot (chicken stew, typically served with a hard-boiled egg).

Outer ring, clockwise starting at the top: gomen besiga (collard greens and beef), beef tibs (sauteed beef and peppers with a sauce of some kind, tough to tell from the picture what sauce was made), atakilt wat (potatoes, carrots, cabbage), can't tell what the next one is (maybe another potato dish?), misir wot (red lentils), probably kik alicha (yellow split peas), shiro wot (chickpeas), key sir alicha (beets and potato), looks like another lentil or split pea dish, and finally gomen wot (collard greens).

Dividing each of the dishes on the outer ring is a rolled up piece of injera, which is a spongy pancake-like bread with a taste similar to sourdough. In Ethiopian dining, you use the injera as your utensil, tearing off small pieces of the bread and using it to grab stews. The sponginess of the injera soaks up the stews' sauce, and you pop the whole thing in your mouth.

In most Ethiopian places, the wot will be served on top of another piece of injera (like you see at the very top of the photo). After all the wot is eaten, you can then eat the injera underneath, which has been soaking up sauce the entire meal. (Or you can just take it to-go, as it's very easy to become super full super quickly eating Ethiopian food. The leftover injera makes a good breakfast.)",

The food is generally not hard to make, the biggest problem is finding all the spices. Some berbere (spice mix) recipes for example will have a dozen or more spices and like four or five of them will be just unobtainable unless you live somewhere with a big Ethiopian community, and even then‚Ä¶maybe not. So you end up making do with what you have and it‚Äôs not bad, but just not as good or rich as it might be. 

The flavored butter (niter kibbeh; it‚Äôs clarified butter like ghee but with onion, garlic, ginger, herbs, and spices) is really key and not hard to make and keeps for a long time.",

lbavrwc,t1_lbaooxd,1dtlnqa,"Mush, fine, but I don't think any of that looks bland. Some of those colors only come from heavy spice.",
lbarhwu,t1_lbaooxd,1dtlnqa,"A lot of it especially the veggies are pretty mushy but it's tasty delicious mush, sorta like how a lot of Indian foods are similar texture-wise but have very distinct tastes.  There's other textures usually there as well, there's beef tibs (cubed + stir fried beef) and you can see on the top end, diced lamb that's cooked with chilis.  If you're brave, kitfo (the dish that looks like beef+rice in the pic) is normally served completely raw.

Biggest part is the eating experience itself, usually the injera is draped over the plate with the various foods placed directly on top, and you eat it solely with your hands, ripping a piece of injera and scooping up whatever you want.

Injera itself is an extremely unique form of carb as well.  I've never eaten anything similar, it's a slightly sour + fermented, slightly spongy thin pancake that has a relatively neutral taste and meant to accompany the food you eat with it - try and get it made from Teff.  A lot of places use flour instead as it's hard to source.

One of my favorite food experiences ever was visiting an Ethiopian place that primarily served taxi drivers, you just walked in, paid a flat rate, and they would scoop up whatever you wanted and make a huge platter for you.  Think it was only $15 and was basically an AYCE, just say something was delicious and they'd give you more.",
lbbmtdl,t1_lbaooxd,1dtlnqa,"Some of that appeara is basically onion cooked til its paste hiding the chunks of meat, I could see why it'd look like mush if you hadn't had it.  But it's definitely not bland, go find you some - it's very good. Even the rolls of bread, injera, have a strong flavor",
lbb64qi,t1_lbaooxd,1dtlnqa,It's similar to curry. What the fuck are you talking about?,
lbaqid0,t1_lbak3vd,1dtlnqa,[deleted],
lbb3h63,t1_lbad5h0,1dtlnqa,"injera is not supposed to be refrigerated, so i doubt that. it was probably room temperature, which is the normal way to serve injera. it needs to cool down before being eaten with the stews.",
lbcswj5,t1_lbce4ki,1dtlnqa,"Can be but not necessarily. The dish with the egg is the real spicy one here would be my guess. 

The bread is usual some kind of sourdough, but more sour than you have had bread before but it combines really well with the other tastes usually. Some people don't like the bread though. They have no taste ;)

Used to be a real good ethiopian place near my late Uncle in Amsterdam that went under during covid. Both are no longer here unfotunately.",
lbbkuzc,t1_lbb89x2,1dtlnqa,"I'm from Norway and we have a lot of rough texture bread here so it's not that the flavour was strong, rather i thought it was too bland and i didn't like the spongy texture.

It was still an interesting experience to try the Ethiopian cuisine though, i wouldn't mind trying more dishes if i could just eat it with utensils.",

m6yr03a,t1_m6xix5f,1i0euo1,"Here you go:

##### For the Fried Chicken:

- 4 boneless, skinless chicken thighs
- 2 cups buttermilk
- 1 tbsp hot sauce
- 2 cups all-purpose flour
- 1 tbsp garlic powder
- 1 tbsp onion powder
- 1 tbsp ground ginger
- 1 tsp paprika
- Salt and pepper, to taste
- Vegetable oil, for frying

##### For the Kewpie Mayo Ranch:

- 1/2 cup Kewpie mayonnaise (Japanese mayo)
- 1/4 cup buttermilk
- 1 tbsp fresh parsley, finely chopped
- 1 tbsp fresh chives, finely chopped
- 1 tbsp fresh dill, finely chopped
- 1/2 tsp garlic powder
- 1/2 tsp onion powder
- 1/4 tsp salt
- 1/4 tsp black pepper

##### For the Hot Honey Sauce:

- ¬Ω cup honey
- 2 tbsp soy sauce or liquid aminos
- 4 tbsp sriracha hot sauce
- 2 tbsp rice wine vinegar
- 4 cloves minced garlic

##### Additional Ingredients:

- 4 brioche buns, toasted
- Thinly shredded lettuce
- Pickles, sliced (optional)

#### Instructions

##### 1. Marinate the Chicken:

- In a large bowl, mix buttermilk, hot sauce, salt, and pepper. Submerge chicken thighs and marinate for at least 2 hours, or overnight for best results.

##### 2. Prepare the Breading Mixture:

- Combine the flour, garlic powder, onion powder, ground ginger, paprika, salt, and pepper in a shallow dish.

##### 3. First Fry:

- Heat oil in a deep fryer or large pot to 350¬∞F (175¬∞C).
- Remove chicken from the marinade, letting excess drip off. Dredge each piece in the flour mixture, shaking off excess. Fry in batches until just starting to color, about 3 minutes per side. Remove and let rest for a few minutes.

##### 4. Second Fry:

- Return the chicken to the hot oil for a second fry, cooking until golden brown and crispy, about 5-6 minutes more. This double frying ensures an extra crispy exterior. Drain on paper towels.

##### 5. Make the Kewpie Mayo Ranch:

- In a small bowl, combine all ingredients for the ranch and whisk until smooth. Refrigerate until needed.

##### 6. Prepare the Hot Honey Sauce:

- In a saucepan, combine all ingredients for the hot honey sauce. Simmer over low heat for about 5 minutes, stirring occasionally until well combined. Set aside.

##### 7. Assemble the Sandwich:

- Spread a generous amount of Kewpie mayo ranch on both halves of each toasted brioche bun.
- Place a double-fried chicken thigh on each bun, then drizzle generously with hot honey sauce.
- Top with thinly shredded lettuce and slices of pickles if using.
- Cover with the bun top.",

lpipys3,t3_1froxw2,1froxw2,"Heyyyy so as promised I'm sharing the recipe for the muffins I've posted plus my favourite yeasted muffin and my favourite sourdough version.

Recipe for what's in the post

600g Matthews Maizebite flour 400g Mulino Marino Furia 200g water 310g whole milk 3 large eggs 70g honey 20g salt 10g instant yeast

Please feel free to simply replace the flours I've used here with 1000g of bread flour, this is actually my favourite version, I just wanted to experiment with other flours on this one.

Mix everything till it passes the windowpane test then cover and leave till it doubles.

Knock the air out of it and then divide info 113g portions.

Ball up the portions and leave them to double in size. It's best to leave them somewhere like in oven turned off with a little hot water in there to prevent the dough from drying out and forming a skin.

Heat up a pan that has a fitting lid to a medium temp and add your dough then lid for 4-5 minutes, flip them, cover and another few minutes. You'll need to dial your timing here a little with the first batch.

Recipe for my sourdough version (my real favourites)

1000g bread flour 500g whole milk 300g freshly fed stiff starter 60g honey 3 large eggs 22g salt

Mix everything together till it passes the windowpane test then cover and leave till it increases in volume somewhere between 30-50%

Divide into 120g portions and repeat the steps from the recipe above. It will just take much longer for them to proof, just remember to make sure they are left until they have doubled.",

lpf3xrn,t1_lpeosen,1froxw2,"Crumpets are made with a batter somewhat similar to American or Scotch Pancakes, but with yeast instead of bicarb/baking soda. 

They are cooked in ring moulds, which makes them taller than pancakes. 

They are cooked in a pan or on a flat griddle until the top sets, and because they are only cooked from below, the bubbles break through the surface before it has a chance to set, leaving lots of holes perfect for soaking up butter (and honey).

They are best served hot (so the butter melts), but you can buy them ready-made and reheat them in a toaster.

  
English muffins (which are not actually English but were probably based on oven-bottom muffins that are) are made from bread dough rather than batter and are flipped during cooking.

  
Crumpets are served/eaten whole, while English muffins are typically split and filled.",

lph3le4,t1_lpgwd5d,1froxw2,"Yes they are. A muffin is way different in England. It's going to depend on which region you are from for one. In some parts of England a muffin is a large what you would call a hamburger roll used for sandwiches. 

I'm other parts that same thing would be called a barm cake, or bread roll or a bread cake. 

Then there's the sweet kind with chocolate chips etc which are obviously cakes and not bread. 

Instead, its creation is attributed to Samuel Bath Thomas, a British expatriate who emigrated to New York City in 1874. By 1880, Thomas had established his own bakery in the Chelsea neighborhood, where he developed and popularized the English muffin.

Initially, Thomas‚Äôs creation was a split crumpet, known as the ‚Äútoaster crumpet.‚Äù Crumpets are a type of British bread that originated in England, characterized by small holes inside and a moist, tender texture. Thomas adapted this recipe to create a lighter, more bread-like version, which he marketed as the English Muffin

And they are shite compared to crumpets...

Basically, all egg rolls are a kind of spring roll, but most spring rolls are not egg rolls. Spring rolls vary wildly in ingredients and cooking techniques. Lumpia are a Filipino adaptation of a spring roll, having come there with Chinese immigrants under Spanish rule. As with other types of imported Chinese dishes, there are *many* variations in the Philippines. The exact moment that spring rolls were imported to the Philippines is debated, but this immigration occurred from the 1500s through the 1800s. I think most Americans, who are primarily used to eating egg rolls, are probably not aware of any of this, or the difference between the many variations. 

In fact, I would suggest that it is possible these are egg rolls *and* lumpia at the same time, as they may come from a Filipino food tradition, but if they were made using wontons in the American style, that would make them egg rolls too.",

m6i44kv,t1_m6hzas1,1hyfd34,"yes !

i believe i just kinda went off of multiple recipes, and cooking intuition, but i can tell you what i did because it really is so simple.

all i did was cut 1 chicken breast in half, (theyre huge so 1 is too much for me), i pound and flatten it some, and i only season with salt and pepper.

then i set up a station of flour, egg, panko. you dip in order. but it is really important to pat the flour and panko really into the chicken, i didnt the first time and my breading/crust was not sticking to my cooked chicken. then you fry lightly.

the first time i used canola oil as most suggest since it is neutral, though i try to stay away from bad oils. BUT, the second time i used olive oil and my result was much better, and olive oil is healthier so, win win! the olive oil gave it a better crisp without burning it. i used storebought tonkatsu sauce and i will leave the recipe i used for the cabbage slaw.

  
EDIT : my original comment i linked the recipe but the MODs removed my comment, so ill just tell you that the website is called ""Just One Cookbook""",

I would link it but they removed my other comment where i linked the website",
m6ii9qr,t1_m6huzkj,1hyfd34,Try a mixture of fine and regular panko.  The fine will stick better and the regular size adds texture.,
m6i2y2t,t1_m6huzkj,1hyfd34,"so my first attempt the breading did not stick well, 2 things i did differently.

my first attempt, when i coated the chicken with flour and the panko, i didnt press it into the chicken very firmly. i did it lightly, and i also used canola oil. (not sure if that made a difference in breading or not)

  
but my second attempt i made sure to press the flour and panko in firmly, making sure it is really STUCK on that chicken. then i used olive oil, its healthier and i found the crust to be better. and, my breading stuck amazingly to the chicken!",

When I was a kid, my friends dad was famous for having giant community BBQs (we called it a steak fry, no relation to the fried potatoes of the same name) where a bunch of people in our little town would pitch in and he'd grill up a ton of steaks. Dude was a legend. Anyway one time I was at my friend's house on a Friday afternoon or whatever and his dad was getting ready for the steak fry out in the garage, where he had a giant charcoal grill and whatnot. He had just cut up like 10 pounds of onions and had them in a big pot ready to go, and when he stepped out we snuck in to steal some. He caught us and was fucking FURIOUS, he thought we were trying to get the beer! We were like naw man fuck the beer, we just both really really love onions!

You can cook them in the pan only, but they are thick enough that unless you moderate the temperature expertly, they overcook on the outside before the inside is done.

Simmering them in beer lets them cook through without getting gross on the outside. They are also usually very bland, so the addition of beer and salt from the cooking water is welcome.

ljs5h58,t1_ljs4ije,1f0ascm,"Here‚Äôs the recipe:

Lobster Mac & Cheese

2 lobster tails

2 tbsp butter

3 cloves garlic, crushed

Cajun seasoning (e.g. Black Magic from Spiceology)

Salt & pepper

(Optional) Dry white wine

1 pound dry pasta like fusilli, elbow mac, or cavatappi

4.5 cups whole milk

1/2 cup (8tbsp) butter

1/2 cup flour

3 cheeses: sharp cheddar, low-moisture mozzarella, gruyere‚Äîgrate them yourself! ~1.5 loose cups of EACH cheese, mix and match, save a few handfuls to add on top


1. Preheat oven to 375, rack in middle of oven. If you have a flat dutch oven like the one in my post, this can all be made in one pot.

2. IF USING LOBSTER: 

- Cut lobster meat into 1‚Äù chunks. If using live lobster, boil for 2 minutes so you can remove the meat. 

- Melt 2 tbsp butter and add crushed garlic and saute for 30-60 seconds on medium high heat. Add lobster, Cajun seasoning, salt and pepper and saute for another minute, deglazing with a splash of wine if using. Add a quarter cup water, scraping the pan to get as much of the bits as you can, and remove from pan when meat is opaque.

- Wipe the pan with a damp paper towel to pick up any stray bits that will burn.

3. Melt 1/2 cup (8tbsp) butter in a heavy bottom pan on low heat. Once melted, add flour a little at a time, whisking quickly to prevent clumping, to make a roux.

4. Add milk a little at a time, whisking vigorously until all of the milk is gone. I did about 1/2 a cup at a time at first, then 1 cup at a time until all of the milk was incorporated. 

5. Season the sauce with as much Cajun seasoning as you‚Äôd like and some pepper. Wait to salt until after the cheese and pasta are in. Simmer on low heat for 3-5 minutes, stirring from the bottom up to prevent sticking.

6. Turn off heat and add in grated cheese. Stir until fully melted.

7. Cook pasta per package instructions until al dente (try to have this done around the time your cheese sauce is, time depends on pasta).

8. Add pasta to cheese sauce and mix to combine. Taste a couple pieces to adjust for salt. Add in lobster + juices if using.

9. Top the mac with rest of the grated cheese in a flat layer and bake for 25-30 minutes until top is bubbly. 


I honestly left mine in there for like 40 so it was way drier than I wanted it to be, I don‚Äôt recommend. Adjust time to your preference though. It‚Äôs better to use unsalted butter if you want to fully control salt level but I used Kerrygold salted and it was fine.",

Strict focus on what makes something really good.

I can't do onions, so I would die. I'd have to wait until one of the monthly specials didn't have onion. heh.

I love the absolute utter care and concern he has for the food. You can see that he has put in time - finding the right ingredients, figuring out the best methods, making it consistent so that every damn burger that comes off the grill is top notch, every time.

I respect that sort of craftsmanship.

Also, as a displaced Texan who ended up in Hampton Roads, Virginia, I was pleased to see we had a local Whataburger. And then I realized it was actually What-A-Burger. Which is actually the slightly older chain. tl;dr: They both started and when they discovered each other, the court case ended up with them agreeing to not compete in each others' areas. Supposedly What-a-Burger is pretty good, but I haven't been. Even though Whataburger got sold so it is no longer the institution it used to be, I just can't bring myself to eat at the ""enemy"" (even though I don't care that much in reality). lol",

ky7efe1,t3_1bwlhly,1bwlhly,"That's not NC BBQ style . Looks more like TX.  The only thing there that I see at NC style places is the pulled pork and the beans.  I grew up in NC around Charlotte and did not know about the other items on your plate until I started to travel and went to TX.  

I took my dad to Fox Bros in Atlanta and he was amazed at how different TX is from simple pulled pork, slaw, fries, hush puppies,  baked beans, and BBQ slaw.  That's basically all NC style really is.  Add in the vinegar based BBQ sauce.  I like the vinegar based sauce because it not as sweet as TX style.

EDIT: If you're ever around Charlotte and want to taste NC style:

BBQ King in Lincolnton

Carolina Country BBQ in Gastonia

Hillbilly's BBQ in Gastonia

Bridges BBQ is Shelby.

Those are also not as smoke filled as TX so be warned there. I hate slaw and always say ""slaw is used to cover a bad smoke (no smoke flavor).""

EDIT 2:  I don't know why people are down voting my comment.  I live in the Atlanta area and there are many places I can buy a plate like that round me.  If I want true NC style, I have to go home and eat it there.  Typically that would be Carolina Country.   If I can find NC style here it is served by a church fundraiser:  smoke some pork, put it on a bun, add slaw, put beans and a pack of plain Lay's chips in the container.  Small thing of vinegar based sauced.  That's all there is to it.",

ky7fye2,t1_ky7d0hp,1bwlhly,"My guess is that they‚Äôre pointing out that there are far too many meat offerings for either of the traditional (western/eastern) NC styles. It‚Äôs pretty much exclusively pork shoulder chopped or pulled (correct me on the pulled but I think eastern has that variation) with the main difference being the type of sauce (‚Äúdip‚Äù in W NC, vinegar w red chili flakes in E NC). Sausage and brisket are not seen in traditional NC bbq. You may see chicken halves on Wednesday or some other day of the week but that‚Äôs about it in terms of variety. Also, no slaw no slaw on the plate and no hush puppies. This plate is just more of a stereotypical bbq platter from a restaurant that makes BBQ in NC, not an example of NC style bbq.

So so so many BBQ places in the rest of the country do this because nobody outside the KC metro knows any better.

I normally add a couple drops of white vinegar to the water when I boil purple sweet potatoes to keep them purple. Steaming preserves the color better than boiling, but if you want a vibrant purple, you definitely need to add vinegar at the end. You can also mash boiled purple sweet potatoes (at this point the paste looks really ugly) and then add vinegar. Make sure to add only a little at a time and constantly taste test if you add vinegar at the end. It‚Äôs quite interesting, the purple sweet potato turns a super vibrant pink purple immediately in the area the vinegar is poured on.",

losx8k8,t1_los62h8,1foqm9k,"Cheesecake is a bake that's really hard to mess up badly, but still hard to perfect. There's lots of little details you can skip and it turns out fine, but if you include them it takes it to the next level.

The first of those details was the pan. One of my favorite bakers is Stella Parks and she has a detailed article about her [favorite cheesecake pan](https://www.seriouseats.com/best-cheesecake-pan) and why it's so important. You can make any of these with a regular 9 inch springform pan and they will turn out just fine, but the extra height from this 8 inch wide, 4 inch tall pan really made these special.

Then the first two recipes are also from Stella. Her [NY cheesecake](https://www.seriouseats.com/epic-new-york-cheesecake-from-bravetart) with goat cheese and [lemon ricotta cheesecake](https://www.seriouseats.com/lemon-ricotta-cheesecake).

The Basque was the most complicated. At its most basic, a basque cheesecake is not much different than a regular one, just without a crust and baked a bit hotter so the top and bottom brown. But I read somewhere that a traditional basque cheesecake uses a special cheese called idiazabal, so I got some from a local cheese shop, but it could be hard to find. Then I used a mix of a bunch of recipes, but [this one is a good start](https://www.acozykitchen.com/basque-cheesecake#wprm-recipe-container-50554), adding the grated idiazabel cheese in as well.

I used this [baklava cheesecake recipe](https://buttermilkbysam.com/baklava-cheesecake/). It was a lot of work to carefully layer all the dough.

The peanut butter was easiest, I used [this recipe](https://sugarspunrun.com/peanut-butter-cheesecake/).

If you're looking for a recipe for the first time you do something new, I always highly recommend serious eats. They always explain exactly why they tell you to do things instead of just spitting the recipe out.",
lory562,t1_lorxlpv,1foqm9k,"Lots of work! I made two of them and it took me like an hour and a half of layering of the phyllo dough. It also was a bit undercooked in the middle since it was so hard to tell when it was done.

lot1wlh,t1_lot1e7z,1foqm9k,"It varied. The basque was the least sweet while the baklava one was extremely sweet. I was definitely trying to go for a wide range of different types.

Then I buttered the pizza crust and put it in the toaster oven for a few minutes to crisp it up.

It became a hit in my family and we do that all the time.

The restaurant offered spiciness where you could pick a level from 0-20 or so. Since it was a Japanese Curry I thought I'll go for the middle to get a bit spiciness, so I ordered a 7. I'm quite used to eating hot but what I got was ... a fire inferno.¬†


This thing was one of the hottest meals I ever had. It was not enjoyable to me, but I managed and was somehow wondering what a 20 would have been.¬†¬† ¬†

lqrxk8v,t3_1fxsqrs,1fxsqrs,Yum! Japanese curry is always a delicious choice.,
lqs6h5d,t3_1fxsqrs,1fxsqrs,The color was the same as the bowl so I thought it was just the rice and I was like ‚Äúwhere‚Äôs the curry‚Äù xd,
lqse8gx,t3_1fxsqrs,1fxsqrs,Tried it and it was out of this world,
lqsmlvk,t3_1fxsqrs,1fxsqrs,Nice keep trying different styles of Japanese curry it‚Äôs very broad. Also try all the different things they add very fried things they pair it with.,

lqqppia,t1_lqq6lxh,1fxsqrs,"It was in Paris, restaurant is called Kuma. It was actually better than the few japanese curries i tried in Japan, no doubt there are better ones somewhere in Japan though but this one is really good",
lqq498c,t1_lqpletk,1fxsqrs,"It's really funny too, because most other Japanese dishes, there's a lot more rice. Like if you get gyudon bowls, there's so much more rice vs the meat and sauce. But curry always seems to swing the other way. Which I'll gladly admit I don't mind, I love my Japanese curry extra saucy.",
lqrso3m,t1_lqpletk,1fxsqrs,That's because in Japan there's always more rice available you just need to order it. The cost is *very* low.,
lqqsam7,t1_lqpletk,1fxsqrs,"Curry in most cuisines that have it is hot enough that you eat the sauce and the rice separately, taking a bite of the rice occasionally to cool your mouth down. The gravy on its own is thick and filling, almost like a chunky, spicy beef stew.

Japanese curry is *really* mild, but I wonder if they're not cargo culting the presentation to some extent. Ultimately it's descended from an Indian curry (with a step in between that helps explain why it's so much milder even beyond Japanese tastes tending that way compared to India -- it was introduced to Japan by the Brits), and it makes sense there.",
lqqphj3,t1_lqqlgta,1fxsqrs,It's a Yuzu limonade,
lqq16jt,t1_lqpdvgr,1fxsqrs,So true!  Why is that?,
lqrrvbi,t1_lqrgtgh,1fxsqrs,Not sure how it‚Äôs not mentioned yet.  But every curry house in Japan I went to offered spice levels.  Literally every single one.  And I always cranked it up.  So this ‚ÄúMild Japanese Curry‚Äù is something I‚Äôve never ordered personally.  I can say by default it‚Äôs no spice level.  But there‚Äôs a lot of spicy food in Japan.,
lqrhuk7,t1_lqrbe8d,1fxsqrs,"""Kuma"" in Paris",
lqs9ewp,t1_lqpz67b,1fxsqrs,Try out Tokyo Kitchen.,
lqq1whe,t1_lqpz67b,1fxsqrs,"It's super easy to make your own with roux blocks, I'd just get to the Asian grocer and grab a few different kinds to try, Java is my personal favourite.  Follow the directions on the box, and Google what people add to theirs to sex it up.  I like to use some combination of grated apple, bulldog sauce, ketchup, my own blends of madras curry and/or garam masala, and cocoa powder.",
lqqk7ij,t1_lqpz67b,1fxsqrs,[removed],
lqtdotl,t1_lqrc90e,1fxsqrs,Last time I was in Japan I misunderstood the ideograms on the menu and thought I was ordering extra katsu but I ordered two complete large curries with katsu.  I ate it all but wasn't hungry for the rest of the day.,
lqrhwju,t1_lqqstsv,1fxsqrs,I have no clue what the recipe is,
lqru925,t1_lqqstsv,1fxsqrs,Japanese curry and caramelized chicken fritter - based on the uber eats menu.,
lqq1a0w,t1_lqp9odd,1fxsqrs,"Mole is basically curry, though, isn't it?",
lqslpqo,t1_lqs7az0,1fxsqrs,"there actually is a soup variant, it usually should be not quite soupy...more like a thick sauce",
lqx55xy,t1_lqqppia,1fxsqrs,"Looks bomb. They say ""variety"" is the spice of life. They're wrong - it's curry üòÇ",üòÇ
lqrk08s,t1_lqqsam7,1fxsqrs,I think you're underselling the British step there. Japanese curry has very little resemblance to Indian curry. That's because it's essentially a traditional British stew with curry powder added.,
lqq8o3q,t1_lqq16jt,1fxsqrs,cuz you know the food be banging when they serve with that spoon,
lqs37ox,t1_lqrrvbi,1fxsqrs,"I only had basic internet knowledge like here:

* - Unlike its East Indian cousin, Japanese curry is¬†[mild, slightly sweet, and a little savory¬†](https://piquantpost.com/products/japanese-curry#:~:text=Unlike%20its%20East%20Indian%20cousin,curry%20sauce%20using%20our%20recipe)making it enjoyable for kids and adults alike.
* This product brought a [mild sweetness to Japanese curry](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Japanese_curry), which had been perceived as a spicy, adult dish, and made Japanese curry one of children's favorite dishes.
* Japanese curry often comes with chunks of potato, carrot, onion, and beef... So it's more like a [mildly sweetened thick beef stew ](https://www.reddit.com/r/JapaneseFood/comments/6rw9ta/whats_the_difference_between_japanese_curry_and/)flavored with garam masala.¬†

So I was quite surprised :D",
lqt4eyz,t1_lqs9ewp,1fxsqrs,Thank you. I'll check it out.,
lqre9t7,t1_lqq1whe,1fxsqrs,It's best if I try it at a restaurant first to learn what it tastes like before I go making my own.,
lqq1xd9,t1_lqq1a0w,1fxsqrs,"Curry Is basically mole, though, Isnt It?",
lqs59jg,t1_lqrk08s,1fxsqrs,"It's not that I'm underselling it, it's that they don't really do spicy in Japan anyway. It's not like Korea or Vietnam. They probably never would have imported it direct from India, but British tastes in this regard are similar, so it's not surprising that's the path it took to get to them.",
lqs64gs,t1_lqre9t7,1fxsqrs,"Why?  The roux blocks do all the seasoning for you, there's no guesswork.  I ate instant curry for years before having it in a restaurant, it's the way japanese people make it at home.",
lqq27cy,t1_lqq1xd9,1fxsqrs,I reckon they're different names for the same thing.,
lqt4oaq,t1_lqs64gs,1fxsqrs,I'm just saying I never tried it. Wouldn't it make sense to try an authentic dish before attempting to make something I don't even know what it should taste like?,
lqq3u5y,t1_lqq27cy,1fxsqrs,"I agree
And feliz cumplea√±os compa <3",
lqtdz9s,t1_lqt4oaq,1fxsqrs,"I don't know, I would just make it.  It's a processed product with instructions on the box, it's like saying you can't make a box of mac& cheese.  It already tastes the way it should taste, it's premade.  But, up to you.  My Japanese friend introduced me to it, we were in the grocery store and she just said buy this, it's good.  And that was before the internet was full of handy instructions.",

I ended up getting rid of the pasta machine but every once in a while a post like this comes up making me want to try it again. I think id definitely need an electric pasta maker though.

lusgzwl,t3_1ggiksu,1ggiksu,"No offense, but I wouldn't eat any of this... it's too beautiful to ruin! Well done!",
lutqc79,t3_1ggiksu,1ggiksu,"Anytime I see a high quality food picture on reddit that is just waaaaayyy above any high quality food picture on reddit, I go ""it has to be joross31"".

And every single time it is.

The level of creativity on display in every part of the presentation is mesmerizing. 

The food, the setup & the photography is always so meticulously planned and executed...

I could get lost for hours in each picture trying to figure out the thought process behind every step. The choice of meal, spacing, plates, deco, background, tone, color scheme is fascinating!

I would totally watch a youtube channel where you go about your thought process & execution.",

The first one wasn't too hard (it uses silicone molds which I love because they make things look professional) but it takes some time to assemble all the layers. Good news is it goes in the freezer so can be (and was) made over several days when you have time.,

luq4a45,t1_luq2vvi,1ggiksu,"Most of the sweeteners cause me some GI trouble in large amounts so for that reason, I prefer stevia glycerite (I like the NOW brand). All other stevia tastes terrible to me but that one is pretty good. So I sweeten things to taste with that and only that if I don't need the sweetener structurally. If I want soft and gooey, then allulose works well. It's great for caramel and also keeps ice cream from freezing so solid. It's \~70% the sweetness of sugar so if I need to, I can adjust up sweetness with stevia. If I want crisp candy like then I use isomalt (it's great for those tuiles or decor or imitating hard crack sugar). Most often, I will use a mix. Sometimes I use monk fruit with erythritol but I don't love it as it leaves a weird cooling sensation but can be much less detectible in lower amounts. It's also good for the crispy texture. Lastly, I like some chocolates sweetened with non GMO resistant dextrin, like Choczero. I find it has the best taste and least GI effect.",

lv1elgh,t1_luulytc,1ggiksu,Thanks! And I think they are vintage dessert forks!,
lv1erfm,t1_luyospd,1ggiksu,"Personally, I like to use natural light (but mostly because I do not have the budget or space for a lighting set up).¬†



Use one light source (ie make sure to turn off any lights if shooting indoors with natural light), preferably indirect light from a natural source (I like to shoot right next to a window). I also use a reflector (a thin cheap white fabric that you can buy on amazon) to bounce light back onto the food - I set this up right next to the table I am shooting on opposite the window - it helps add light back into the shadows so they aren‚Äôt so harsh. It helps but isn‚Äôt totally necessary.



Don‚Äôt use flash if you can avoid it as it casts harsh shadows and tends to wash things out. Also, try not to cast your own self as a shadow over the food (I see this one a lot).



Simplify the background (helps bring the focus on the food). It can help to zoom in a bit as this will minimize the background as well. If you can change the depth of field, try to shoot with a lower f stop (make the background out of focus).



Pick your focus - what immediately drew you in about the food? What do you want people to see first? Pick that and focus on that.



If you have a horizon line (table line or counter edge/background) try to keep that straight.



Look up rule of thirds - it‚Äôs a great easy go to style of composition. The other thing is placing the food in the middle of the frame. And experiment with how much you fill the frame with the food (ie the whole plate is in the shot or maybe try zooming in/cropping so that the edges of the plate are cut off and the food is large).



Generally use simple bowls with minimal patterns (just depends on the style you are going for but too busy patterns can compete for attention).



Garnishes like fresh herbs can make a big difference!



You may need to adjust the white balance, especially if shooting with lighting that isn‚Äôt natural.



All the rules are meant to be broken so just play around and have fun with it! Hope that helps a bit!",

**Apricot and Vanilla Galaxy Cakes (Apricot Jam, Vanilla Cr√®me L√©g√®re, Lemon Meringue Shards, Mirror Glaze, and Chocolate Decor)**

**Ingredients**:

**Apricot Jam**:

1 cup dried apricots

water, as needed

stevia glycerite, to taste

lemon juice, to taste

pinch salt

**Lemon Meringue Shards**:

2 egg whites

120g isomalt, powdered (I like to blend granulated isomalt in a high power blender until powdered)

pinch of salt

1/2 teaspoon vanilla extract

zest of 1 lemon

yellow color, natural, to taste, optional

**Cr√®me L√©g√®re (Lightened Pastry Cream)**:

1/2 teaspoon gelatin, unflavored added to 1 tablespoon cold water for 10 minutes to rehydrate

1 cup heavy cream, divided (reserve half for whipping later) or cashew cream for dairy-free, or coconut cream for nut-free

1 cups cashew milk, or almond milk, or coconut beverage for nut-free

1/4 teaspoon glucomann powder, optional, helps with texture

4 egg yolks

1/2 teaspoon stevia glycerite, or 1/2 cup allulose, or 1/6 cup monk fruit, powdered

1/16 teaspoon salt

1/2 tablespoon vanilla extract

2 tablespoons butter, or butter flavored coconut oil for dairy-free

small pinch xanthan gum, optional, helps stabilize whipped cream

**For Decoration**:

Chocolate (white, milk, or dark - your choice), sugar-free

edible gold lustre dust

**Mirror Glaze**:

5 g gelatin, unflavored bloomed in 2 tablespoons cold water for 10 minutes

1/4 cup plus 2 tablespoons liquid allulose

1/4 cup heavy cream

45g sugar-free white chocolate

food color, to taste",
lw3r3zq,t1_lw3qv7z,1ggiksu,"**Instructions**:

**For the Apricot Jam**:

‚Ä¢¬†Add the apricots to a pot and just cover with water. Cover the pot and bring to a boil. Remove from heat and let stand until soft, plump, and hydrated, about 30 minutes. Let cool slightly and then transfer the apricots and water while still quite warm to a high power blender. Blend on high with the stevia, and salt. Adjust sweetness to taste and then¬† transfer to small hemisphere molds and freeze completely, at least 4 hours and preferably overnight. Press out of molds and reserve until needed. Can be made up to one month ahead and kept frozen in an airtight container.



**For the Lemon Meringue Shards**:

‚Ä¢ Preheat the oven to 175¬∫F and line a rimmed baking sheet with a silicone baking mat or parchment paper. Set aside.



‚Ä¢¬†Beat the egg whites with an electric mixer until soft peaks. Slowly beat in the powdered isomalt, beating until stiff peaks and then beat in salt, extract, color, and zest. Spread into an even thin layer on a silicon baking mat. Bake at 175¬∫F for 2 hours, or until crisp. Break into bite size pieces (store at room temperature for up to 1 week in an airtight container).



**For the Lightened Pastry Cream**:

‚Ä¢ Add 1/2 cup cream and milk to a large pot on medium heat and bring to a simmer then reduce the heat to low.



‚Ä¢¬†Whisk the yolks together with the stevia, salt, and glucomann in a large heat proof bowl.



‚Ä¢¬†When the milk and cream are at a low simmer, slowly pour the hot mixture into the egg yolks while whisking constantly to keep the eggs from overcooking to temper them. Then pour the tempered yolks back into the pot of cream. Cook while whisking slowly and constantly until thickened, about 4-5 minutes. As the mixture becomes more thick, whisk vigorously to keep the cooking even, watching for bubbles. When you see a couple of bubbles, remove from heat. Do not boil as it will cause the eggs to overcook and scramble.¬†



‚Ä¢¬†Remove from heat and whisk in the rehydrated gelatin until smooth, about 1 minute. Then whisk in the butter, another 30 seconds or so.¬†



‚Ä¢¬†Strain the mixture through a fine mesh strainer and into a storage container. Immediately press plastic wrap directly onto the surface of the cream to prevent a skin from forming. Refrigerate until completely cold, about 2 hours and up to 3 days.¬†



‚Ä¢¬†Once cold, make the whipped cream to fold into the pastry cream. If using coconut cream, see notes. Beat the cream for 2-5 minutes, or until it becomes light and fluffy and doubles in volume. Sprinkle the xanthan gum in while mixing, if using.



‚Ä¢¬†Beat the chilled pastry cream until smooth and light and then fold in the whipped cream.



‚Ä¢¬†Transfer to large silicone hemisphere molds and press an apricot hemisphere into the middle of each well, topping with more cream. Freeze until set, at least 4 hours and preferably overnight. Can be made up to one week ahead and kept frozen.",

‚Ä¢¬†Temper chocolate and fill molds. Let set and turn out. Coat with gold lustre dust and reserve until needed. Can be made up to one month ahead and stored at room temperature in an airtight container.



**For the Mirror Glaze**:

‚Ä¢¬†Heat the cream and allulose over medium heat until just simmering. Add the bloomed gelatin and stir until dissolved. Remove from heat and add the white chocolate. Let stand for 5 minutes to melt the chocolate. Stir until completely smooth and then stir in color to desired strength (divide into bowls to get a multi color effect). (You can place a sheet of plastic wrap directly on the surface of the glaze and refrigerate overnight or use it after making, just make sure to let it cool to 90¬∫F before applying it.)



‚Ä¢¬†Line a rimmed baking sheet with plastic wrap and invert cups smaller than the entremets on the sheet. Unmold the cakes and place on top of the cups so that the edges of the cake overhang (this will allow the glaze to flow over the edges of the cake). When the glaze is 90¬∫F, pour the glaze over frozen cake (if you want a multicolor effect, pour the multiple colors into one container and using a knife, very gently swirl the colors together). When the glaze stops dripping, trim any drips over the edge with a knife and then transfer the cake to a serving plate. Sprinkle a bit of lustre dust on top of each entremet. Let thaw before serving.



**To Assemble**:

‚Ä¢¬†Scatter shards of meringue around the base of each entremet. Top with moon and star chocolates and serve.",

I don't really see how that applies.

It was made by desi immigrants, combining two indian dishes, using indian cooking methods, for an indian restaurant. 

It might be first made in the UK yes, but not really relevant to the comment I'm replying to, which is based on the culture of the dish and how to consume it.

This is relevant because Indian foods are closely intwined in British culture, and is eaten incredibly commonly and across the whole country. Tika masala is one of many curry-based dishes made in Britain called BIR.

not similar, it is a fully indian curry with one ingredient being replaced by another which is also indian.

this is the equivalent of americans claiming they invented the modern pizza, when it's just a slight variation from the Italian one.

Applies more to you. Again how is any of this relevant to this thread?

lvhlzid,t1_lvhgrh4,1gjt9qi,"It's good if you cook it right, it's a non-heading brasscia (same family as cabbage, broccoli, and others.) Mustard greens, cabbage collard (not actually cabbage, more like a yellow collard), and a few other greens can be cooked in a similar fashion (I like mustard greens with Louisiana hot sauce and butter personally.)

I like it with ribs, red beans and rice (which I make with pickled pork and andouille sausage), fried chicken, or pulled pork. Then I'd likely add a vinegar-slaw, salad (since I like fresh veggies as well), and corn bread (maybe melon, or fruit as I can get it for desert.)",
lvipzb7,t1_lvip39a,1gjt9qi,Not in my 50+ years experience eating cornbread in Maryland. I think we‚Äôre still on the ‚Äúno sugar‚Äù side of the Cornbread Mason-Dixon Line.,
lvlv5nr,t1_lvip39a,1gjt9qi,"My mom always used Jiffy, but we were more likely to have dinner rolls than cornbread most of the time. Cornbread was for specific meals like chili.",
lvhm0zq,t1_lvhlzid,1gjt9qi,Ok mouth watering,
lviqjce,t1_lvipzb7,1gjt9qi,"oh wow! i‚Äôm from west coast but family origins from texas/the south &i‚Äôve mostly only ever seen sweet cornbread. guess thats true, the more you know",
lvj7c4e,t1_lviqjce,1gjt9qi,"I‚Äôm over in Missouri, and it‚Äôs both here! Sweet honey cornbread, or jalapenos and/or cheesey cornbread is pretty standard here.",
lt2i7ef,t3_1g8yf5h,1g8yf5h,Very nice! Its makes me nostalgic for the 80's and 90's cakes that were made using a pan specific to an animal or character and then showed you how to decorate it like a color by number.,
lt20u3x,t3_1g8yf5h,1g8yf5h,That looks so good and perfect!!! You must be really good in baking,
lt3f3wn,t3_1g8yf5h,1g8yf5h,I love this! My mom would make us birthday cakes in this style every year for our birthdays. So classic.,

lt7nh6k,t3_1g8yf5h,1g8yf5h,"Oh wow! I loved Winnie the Pooh growing up and this brought me back to my fifth or sixth? birthday when my mom made me a cake exactly like this, same piping and all. She even put real honey in the opening part of the honey pot to make it look more realistic. I remember being really excited about how the cake looked, and I asked my mom if my slice of cake could have part of the honey on it. She told me no and never gave me a reason why, and I know I felt disappointed, but I don't remember anything other than that from my birthday. I still love Winnie the Pooh, as it makes me feel so nostalgic, and i love the old art style :)",

Allowing bite by bite saucing variation of both quantity and flavor selection. Furthermore to maintain optimal crispiness a fry needs to be thermally insulated while allowing the ventilation of steam produced post cook. Saucing fries critically impacts this process causing a severely shortened lifespan to an already fragile sauce delivery system. Finally, the sodium levels cannot be monitored or regulated once sauce has been applied, which can cause serious health complications and potentially fatal consequences.

I asked if you could make long ones as well and he said theoretically yes,
kwhxn2d,t1_kwcdszn,1bmler8,I have the feeling that this isn‚Äôt pure potato. It‚Äôs probably mashed potatoes with starch and flour mixed and pressed through a spaghetti maker. Though I have heard of a strain of really big potatoes before‚Ä¶,

lq5tz92,t3_1fvby43,1fvby43,"Here is the recipe if you want to try and make it!

Ingredient:¬†

Sweet Pastry:

175g Plain Flour

25g Icing Sugar

100g Butter (Cold and cut into cubes)

1 x Egg Yolk

1 Tbsp Ice Cold Water

Key Lime Pie Filling:

397ml Condensed Milk (1 Can)

3 x Egg Yolks

4 x Limes (Juice and Zest)

Caramelised Limes:

4 x Limes

200g Caster Sugar

200ml Water

Decoration:

300ml Double Cream

Zest of 1 Lime (Optional)

1. To make the pastry in a large mixing bowl add the plain flour, icing sugar and cold cubed butter.
2. Rub the butter into the dry ingredients until the mixture resembles breadcrumbs. This can be done in a food process using the pulse function, be careful not to over-blend otherwise the pastry will become tough.
3. Add the egg yolk and ice-cold water into the bowl. Mix until the mixture starts to come together.
4. Tip the ingredients onto a work surface and gather to form a dough. Knead the dough a few times to make the pastry smoother. Form the pastry dough into a ball and slightly flatten it. Try not to knead otherwise the pastry will become tough.
5. Wrap the pastry in clingfilm and place in the fridge to chill for 30 minutes (this will help to relax the pastry).
6. While the pastry is chilling, to make the caramelise limes cut the limes into thin slices. If you have a mandolin use it as it makes it so much easier, I ended up buying one after this!
7. Place the limes into a pan with boiled water and blanch for 2-3 minutes. Then remove the limes from the water and place them on a wire rack to drain.
8. Discard the water and repeat this process. This will help prevent the caramelised limes from becoming bitter.
9. Next place the sugar and water in a pan. Heat until the mixture starts to boil. Add the limes into the sugar solution and reduce the heat to allow the mixture to simmer gently. Place a lid on the pan to stop too much water evaporating away.
10. Keep the limes simmering until they become translucent and remove them from the pan. Place the limes on a baking tray lined with parchment paper and allow to air dry. You can keep the sugar syrup the limes have been poaching in and use it in cocktails for a sweet limey kick!
11. Grease a 23cm/9inch loose bottom fluted tart tin.
12. Remove the pastry from the fridge and place it onto a work surface lightly dusted with flour. Roll the pastry using a rolling pin to a thickness of around 3mm. You can place the tart tin over the rolled-out pastry to see if it has been rolled enough, the pastry should be around 10cm bigger than the tart tin.
13. Carefully lift the pastry and place it over the tart tin. Ease the pastry into the flutes of the tart tin making sure there is pastry overhanging the tart tin. Then with a fork, lightly prick the base of the pastry (this will stop it from puffing up during baking).
14. Cover the tart in clingfilm and place in the fridge for 30 minutes.
15. Preheat the oven to 180C/350F/Gas Mark 4.
16. Once the pastry has chilled remove it from the fridge. Take off the cling film and then scrunch up some parchment paper so it becomes malleable. Place over the tart and fill with baking beans, I used a mixture of rice and flour instead!
17. Blind bake the tart for 13-15 minutes. Remove from the oven and remove the parchment paper and baking beans.
18. Trim off the excess pastry using a sharp knife. Cut at an angle and away from you to get a nice clean cut on the pastry.
19. Remove the excess pastry trimmings and bake for 10-12 minutes until the pastry becomes a pale golden colour and the base has dried out.
20. While pastry is cooling, reduce the temperature of the oven to 150C/300F/Gas Mark 3.
21. To make the Key Lime Pie filling, add the condensed milk, egg yolks and the zest and juice of the limes into a bowl. Mix until the ingredients are fully incorporated and the mixture starts to thicken up.
22. Pour the Key Lime Pie Mixture into the cooled tart case and bake for 15 minutes.
23. Once baked remove from the oven and allow the Key Lime Pie to cool. When the Key Lime Pie is cooled, remove it from the tart tin and chill in the fridge for 1 hour (the longer the better).
24. Place the double cream into a bowl and whisk using an electric mixer or stand mixer until soft peaks form.
25. When the Key Lime Pie has cooled remove it from the fridge. Place the whipped cream into a piping bag fitted with a Wilton 2D Piping Tip. Pipe rosettes onto the Key Lime Pie.
26. Finally place the Caramelised Limes around the whipped cream.
27. Using a microplane Zest a lime over the top of the Key Lime Pie so a little bit of extra decoration.",

m24qvet,t1_m24o47d,1hejzpz,"Super high heat, dry pan, cold fatty beef, and a hard smash. It's almost a smearing action when I press with a very stiff stainless spatula. I press right away in the middle to start and quickly taper the patty out as I smash. That gets those awesome lacy edges while maintaining a slightly thicker center of the patty. Also, I use a flexible stainless steel drywall putty knife to scrape the patties off the pan after smashing. You want them to stick to the pan while cooking, but you need something thin and springy to release and maintain that crust you just worked so hard to develop.

Also, the weight of the ball of beef is super important as well. Anything over 3 to 3.5 oz is gonna be hard to smash, take too long to cook, and/or cook unevenly. If I'm making doubles, I reduce them down to about 2-2.5 oz of beef.",

Just made smash burgers last night and they were great. Grinded a blend of chuck and short rib.

I got the Pro version that is 3/8"" thick. Which makes it quite heavy and not meant to be removed. So I use a countertop burner for things that need to be contained. The pro version can do pots and pans without warping, but it just takes longer than I like.

Get that oil base as large and hot as you (safely) can, so when you fry it doesn't have to rebound as much in temperature... So your food ends up crispier, crunchier and less oily than a ""cold fry"". (thanks Alton B!)

As for salting I'm a bit of a stickler so I double hit most of my foods with a dusting of fine ground sea salt (or Morton's if I'm lazy/travelling) and then a nice ""crusting"" of a coarser salt like kosher or coarse grain sea salt or the likes. But yeah, it's easier to UNDER-season than to Over-season IMO/IME.",
m24ygk4,t1_m24w328,1hejzpz,I always screw up the sauce. What kind of stock did you use? Self made or from a can or packet?,
m2bxmay,t1_m26gwmi,1hejzpz,"So just sort of a classic ‚Äúcreamy pan sauce‚Äù, I guess. I‚Äôll check out the recipe. Cheers.",
m295q8s,t1_m2956om,1hejzpz,[removed],
m26ga5v,t1_m25yqcy,1hejzpz,"Not really. It's got no flour in it, and it calls for beef stock and brandy/cognac. Look up the steak au poivre recipe from Serious Eats and that is the sauce. Only thing I changed is that I added cheese at the end since there isn't any on the patties.",
m2540te,t1_m252697,1hejzpz,"Yes! And like, I've made Kenji's triple cooked fries before, and while they are singularly the absolute best fries I've ever had, they are just *so* much work. So you better believe I'm gonna let OreIda do the heavy lifting on the prepro for the fries sometimes. They're really pretty great if you do take the step to actually deep fry them too!",
m24yvht,t1_m24ygk4,1hejzpz,This was a blend of homemade roasted beef stock topped up with some unsalted boxed stuff cuz I was gonna run out of the good stuff.,
m295yjf,t1_m295q8s,1hejzpz,[removed],
m26xrfl,t1_m26ga5v,1hejzpz,Yup that's how I know it. More of a black pepper cognac sauce and it's fuckin delicious. Good job man,
m2559og,t1_m2540te,1hejzpz,"Oh I feel you, lol! I'm much like Kenji at times where I want to find ""THE BEST"" (tm) recipe/way to make something... And SOMETIMES that way and added effort and time ABSOLUTELY is 1000% worth it, and THEN some! But others... Something that can take 33% the time and 5% the prep work (like Ore Ida frozen goodnesses lol) does some 90% of the job (if not more with a little bit of proper seasoning and whatnot) so why bother unless you're trying to impress yourself or someone else IMO...

Tldr, can I make a hash brown scramble better than anything frozen, yeah you betcha! But do I wanna make ~50+ tater tots which might be some -20 to +20% worse/better than frozen by hand? 


FUCK NO!",

lro9ugy,t1_lrk7z2c,1g1suvr,"Thanks! Here‚Äôs the recipe I wrote and I hope you enjoy!

<Shepherd‚Äòs Pie>

1000g Minced Lamb meat 
Salt and Pepper 

1 middle sized Onion, diced
5 pieces of minced Garlic
600g Frozen vegetables of your choice, cut into bean size ( I used a mix of carrot, green beans, peas and corns)

150g red wine
5 tbsp tomato paste
1 tbsp Chicken Bouillon powder or liquid
13 tbsp Worcestershire sauce 
1/2 tbsp sugar
5 tbsp all purpose flour 

480g water

For mashed potatoes)
1.3kg uncooked and peeled potatoes
 110g melted butter
280g milk (you can substitute some of it with heavy cream for richer taste)
150g mozzarella/cheese of your choice 
4 large egg yolks
Salt and pepper

Heat up a wok or big pot real hot with high heat, drizzle enough oil and start to stir fry minced lamb meat. Season with salt and pepper then you wanna stir fry it at least for 15 minutes for all the water to vaporize and get the Maillard you want on the meat. When it‚Äôs properly browned, toss in all the onions, garlic and frozen vegetables. Cook it all together for about 5 minutes until onions are transparent. 

Deglaze with wine, put in tomato paste, bouillon, Worcestershire sauce, sugar and mix together. Then in goes flour, mix in and slightly stir fry all together for about additional 2 minutes. 

Pour in the water and boil until it gets the consistency where it wouldn‚Äôt fall apart when scooped up. Boiling long enough to make the meat sauce not so liquidy is very important here since it‚Äôs gonna be cooked in the oven with mashed potatoes fully covered on top - that means pretty much no water from the meat sauce part is gonna vaporize in the oven. 


To make mashed potatoes, boil the potatoes in a pot with a strong pinch of salt. Take em out when your fork test says so - they need to be tender enough easily to be mashed. 
Drain out all the water and put butter, milk, cheese, egg yolks in. Give it a good mix and season with salt and pepper to taste. You might want it to be slightly saltier than you expect since these mashed potatoes are gonna make quite thick of a layer.

In an about 23x33cm baking dish, pour in all the meat sauce and make a flat layer. On goes the mashed potatoes, make it also flat without any leftover space. All of the meat sauce needs to be covered - You don‚Äôt wanna see the meat sauce anywhere at this point. 
With a fork, drag the surface from one side to the other. This is actually pretty important since it gives the dish not only a great visual, but also unevenly crunchier surface which means more interesting texture. 

Dish goes in a preheated 220C or 428F oven and gets baked for about 40 minutes. It needs golden brown and kind of slightly burnt surface so do customize the baking time depending on your oven.

If you wanna make it a bit more interesting, you can use a fire torch to give it a bit more burnt look after taking out of the oven.

Garnish with some dried parsley and let cool for at least 30 minutes.

Slice in and enjoy.",

Drain out all the water and put butter, milk, cheese, egg yolks in. Give it a good mix and season with salt and pepper to taste. You might want it to be slightly saltier than you expect since these mashed potatoes are gonna make quite thick of a layer.

In an about 23x33cm baking dish, pour in all the meat sauce and make a flat layer. On goes the mashed potatoes, make it also flat without any leftover space. All of the meat sauce needs to be covered - You don‚Äôt wanna see the meat sauce anywhere at this point. 
With a fork, drag the surface from one side to the other. This is actually pretty important since it gives the dish not only a great visual, but also unevenly crunchier surface which means more interesting texture. 

Dish goes in a preheated 220C or 428F oven and gets baked for about 40 minutes. It needs golden brown and kind of slightly burnt surface so do customize the baking time depending on your oven.

If you wanna make it a bit more interesting, you can use a fire torch to give it a bit more burnt look after taking out of the oven.

Garnish with some dried parsley and let cool for at least 30 minutes.

Slice in and enjoy.",
lroa7ej,t1_lrnvw85,1g1suvr,"Thanks! Here‚Äôs the recipe I wrote and I hope you enjoy!

<Shepherd‚Äòs Pie>

1000g Minced Lamb meat 
Salt and Pepper 

1 middle sized Onion, diced
5 pieces of minced Garlic
600g Frozen vegetables of your choice, cut into bean size ( I used a mix of carrot, green beans, peas and corns)

150g red wine
5 tbsp tomato paste
1 tbsp Chicken Bouillon powder or liquid
13 tbsp Worcestershire sauce 
1/2 tbsp sugar
5 tbsp all purpose flour 

480g water

For mashed potatoes)
1.3kg uncooked and peeled potatoes
 110g melted butter
280g milk (you can substitute some of it with heavy cream for richer taste)
150g mozzarella/cheese of your choice 
4 large egg yolks
Salt and pepper

Heat up a wok or big pot real hot with high heat, drizzle enough oil and start to stir fry minced lamb meat. Season with salt and pepper then you wanna stir fry it at least for 15 minutes for all the water to vaporize and get the Maillard you want on the meat. When it‚Äôs properly browned, toss in all the onions, garlic and frozen vegetables. Cook it all together for about 5 minutes until onions are transparent. 

Deglaze with wine, put in tomato paste, bouillon, Worcestershire sauce, sugar and mix together. Then in goes flour, mix in and slightly stir fry all together for about additional 2 minutes. 

Pour in the water and boil until it gets the consistency where it wouldn‚Äôt fall apart when scooped up. Boiling long enough to make the meat sauce not so liquidy is very important here since it‚Äôs gonna be cooked in the oven with mashed potatoes fully covered on top - that means pretty much no water from the meat sauce part is gonna vaporize in the oven.

What I do is set the heat to max while I prepare the pizza, then I launch the pizza, reduce the heat to minimum while the pizza is in the oven to not burn the top... My guess is that my stone gets just too hot, but if the stone is not hot enough then I risk having the pizza falling apart in the oven when I turn it around.

What's your technique and what the the bottom of the pizza look like?",

m4ix9dv,t1_m4iw509,1hpny38,"A lot of tinkering with small variables. I think one of the best pieces of advice is to pick your ingredients and stick with them - you can experiment with sauce and cheese and toppings whatnot, but to really dial in the dough I think you need to use the same flour and yeast every time while making little tweaks. My perfect pizza is different than yours. Repetition and playing with variables - ratios of ingredients, ferment times, kneading, heat, etc. - are the name of the game. 

Despite the emphasis on ingredients, technique is, imo, more important than the actual dough recipe. Watch tons of YouTube. How you knead, how you flour & handle the dough pre-stretch, stretching, launching, etc. is all crazy important. You can ruin a perfect dough recipe with improper technique, and you can make a decent pizza with subpar dough if you have great technique. 

This is about a 65% hydration, relatively low knead, 48 hr ferment using King Arthur 00 flour and Fleischmann‚Äôs instant yeast, cooked in the ooni koda 16 at about 900.",

m4jq8hh,t1_m4j1mo0,1hpny38,"I've found that the cordierite stone that comes with the ooni burns pizza when it is above ~800F, even with a short cook. I use wood, and I get a good balance of bottom and top cook by getting the stone to 750-800F, then adding a few wood chips to get a top flame, and cooking for about 90s. You also have to make sure there isn't extra flour, especially semolina flour, on the bottom of your pizza as it will burn first.

I recently purchased a Biscotto pizza stone for my Karu 12 and can now launch at 950-1000F stone temp without burning the bottom. The natural stone conducts less heat to the bottom of the pizza. I don't even really worry about minimizing flour so launching is easier too. Using a third party stone isn't recommended by ooni and it takes a lot longer to heat up (1 hour minimum) though so ymmv.",
m4j49pz,t1_m4j1mo0,1hpny38,"Do you use an infrared thermometer? Checking the stone temp is huge, since ambient outdoor temps will dictate how long it takes your stone to heat up. It depends on like a zillion factors. Are you using sugar in your dough? If so, you should probably omit it as it‚Äôs likely the culprit. How thin are you stretching it? How long are you preheating?

The love hate relationship with learning pizza making is that if you ask 100 people what you‚Äôre doing wrong, you‚Äôll get 100 different answers. If I were you I‚Äôd buy an infrared thermometer if you don‚Äôt have one, then start being diligent about noting the temp of the stone and your results, and adjusting from there.

Editing to add: also be aware of the ‚Äú3 zones‚Äù on a koda 16. Back left corner is the hottest, middle is medium, and front right is the coolest. If you think your pie needs more time on the bottom, bring it to the front right corner so you don‚Äôt burn the toppings. If your bottom is starting to burn and you need to fire the top at full blast to catch up, move it to the back right.",

And you took it camping?! Hell yeah",
lnw1lpz,t3_1fkjwtg,1fkjwtg,"Some recipe notes:

* Used two top sirloin roasts I had in the freezer.
* Thawed the meat, patted dry, salted with kala namak salt and ground black pepper. Racked and let dry uncovered in the fridge overnight.
* Peppers ratioed at 2 parts guajilo, 1 part ancho, 1 part chipotle, 1 part dried garden peppers.
* Dried peppers were reconstituted in water, and then blended down with some additional water and beef cube stock with achiote paste. Intense red colour is largely from the paste. It adds an interesting floral tone with a small hint of cinnamon, peppery.
* Into the sauce, I blended in some tomato paste (half a small can). Added some garden tomatoes for equal dimensions of tomatoness when I popped everything into the roasting tray.
* Added some roasted and ground cumin and coriander seed for spice. I also ground down some dried onion and a little garlic powder (not enough to really taste, but to blend into the profile). Added a touch of oregano at the end, and some brown sugar to up the sweet a bit, which also tamed the heat a touch.
* Added a finger of baker's chocolate.
* Edit4: added some apple cider for a touch of tang. Only a bit, a couple of table spoons across the whole thing.
* Beef was smoked with the onion - that was cool. Helped reinforce that smoke flavour. Smoking lasted about 4h or so at 200F or so (slowed to 175F)  until the interior of the roasts measured 150F, Added chips 3 times throughout the process. I used a whole regular size bag of charcoal - most of it was just to get the vessel up to temp and keep it stable as the first half of the fuel burnt off.
* Beef wasn't suuuuper fatty, so I added some bacon fat when frying the smoked onion.
* Braised the meat in the chili sauce with the tomatoes at 275F for 3.5h or so, until beef was pull-tender.
* Total cook time, 8h, with some simple but long prep for the meat, and then the cool off period to be able to pull the beef, and then further cooling before storage. It's basically a full day affair lol

Result? Amazing. Made this for a camping trip for 7 total, everyone loved it. Made it the day before, kept cool in the fridge in a foiled-over, doubled-up foil tray from the dollar store. Threw it onto the BBQ to warm up. The easy serving was a blessing. Served with rice, tortilla, sour cream, salsa, and fresh cilantro.

EDIT: forgot a detail

EDIT2: Some ideas I had to improve this chili. Make a beef stock from bones and fried saved cuttings. Brown the roasts before smoking to build a tasty crust that will pass on more beef flavour into the chili. Use a fattier cut. 

EDIT3: Try roasting the roasting the peppers a bit prior to reconstituting them! Gotta try marinating the onions next time before smoking, too.

EDIT4: Forgot i added vinegar to the thing. Future idea, add McIntosh apples - smoke them with the onion.

EDIT5: About the achiote paste, i minced about two game dice worth, boiled it in a small pot of water on the side, along with the beef stock cube (1 or 1.5, i cannot recall).",

All simmered in broth or water for a while then blended.     My Chili using that method turned out hardly any kick at all, I probably will add a few more of the spicier  ones next time actually.",
lnwcy8t,t1_lnwch5z,1fkjwtg,"Well, it definitely had some heat, but it wasn't super spicy. The guajilos are very mild, the anchos are only so-so, the chipotle have a standard kick, and the garden peppers were mostly not-hot to only mild. So, it came out pretty tame.

lnycebi,t1_lnya813,1fkjwtg,"So, the peppers i used came from a local grocer. I used three kinds, each 85g (i think) packs. I got 2x guajilo (sweet, tangy, very mild, main body of the sauce), 1x ancho (deep flavour, plummy earthy, flavour dimension), and 1x chipotle (ie, smoked jalapeno, different/additional layer of smoke, somewhat bitter but deep flavour). There are others to consider. Honestly the more the merrier, but the trick is the ratio of each to capture a big picture of that flavour essence of ""chili"". And, learning about each one is the adventure. 

Achiote/Annatto is a paste/stock/base that's made from a seed. You can buy blocks of it, like cube stock. And you only need a bit. Like, I'm talking about as much as a regular game die. Maybe two for a big batch. This stuff goes faaarrrr. Haha. But ya, wiki it. Very neat and essential ingredient. 

And for ingredients, it's mostly as you see. I tried to add as many notes as possible, but it was all taste and feel. I couldn't repeat exact measurements Hahaha.",

lny9ruv,t1_lny7609,1fkjwtg,"Oh, nice question. 

So, the easy idea is to marinate onions in water, salt, and some vinegar. Cut them in half, keeping the skin on - no change there. Poke holes in the bottom to get that marinade in. Like, 2% brine. Don't bother with aromatics. And then after 24h, smoke the onions the same way. 

But now, I just thought of first doing a ferment of the onion. It'd be a 7 day affair. So, basically don't use vinegar, only do brine, and drop in lemons in slices to bring the pH down a touch. The lacto bacteria will transform sugars into lactic acid, which has its own interesting tang to it. Plus the brine takes on the citric acid and lemon. Win win. Because that brine is what you can use for reconstituting the peppers. That would be a heckin thing...",

kox4b4a,t3_1aivlfs,1aivlfs,"If anyone wants to know how to make them I‚Äôll put it here: 
I don't have really strict recipe, just kind of eyeball it and season to taste, but here's how I make them!

About 1lb of large sea scallops, foot removed

A few tablespoons of butter

Salt

Pepper

Lemon 

Fresh parsley

Make sure the scallops are dry, prior to cooking added salt and let sit in the fridge for about an hour, then patted dry. make sure the scallops are properly seasoned with salt and pepper before cooking. Start by heating up a pan to high heat with a high smoke point oil, I used avocado oil.
Make sure the pan is SUPER hot before you add the scallops. Place the scallops in the pan, make sure they aren't touching each other for the best results. Set a timer for minutes. Don't touch the scallops until the 2 minutes are done or else you can mess up the sear. After the 2 minutes is done, you can lower the heat and flip all of the scallops, they should have a beautiful golden brown sear on them. Now you can add the lemon, butter, and parsley to taste. Cook for another 2(ish) minutes until the scallops are done throughout. I like to have the scallops with some of that buttery lemony sauce over rice.",

kox96xz,t3_1aivlfs,1aivlfs,"Once you get the technique of cooking scallops down it becomes stupid easy.   

Then you just need to remember to make sure everything else is prepped ahead of time cuz cooking the scallops themselves only takes about 4 minutes.

And you need to make sure all your dinner guests are sitting and enjoying their appetizers before the scallops themselves get plated nice and hot.

kp1rfz3,t1_koxjoe2,1aivlfs,"The abductor and adductor are muscles. Inside and outside of the thigh. Shells also have an adductor, they use it to pull the she'll closed.",
kp1fnyo,t1_kp0tdbg,1aivlfs,"As some of the other comments mentioned, also need to look at the type of the scallops. There‚Äôs wet and dry scallops. Wet scallops are put into a chemical solution and hold liquids and are hard to get a good sear on.",
koxnto1,t1_koxlgcy,1aivlfs,"I usually do closer to 2 minutes on low heat, enough to get the butter, parsley, and lemon bubbling a bit but not enough to overcook them",
koz01tf,t1_koyt2ei,1aivlfs,"Almost all of the cost is the scallops, which where I‚Äôm at are $20-30/lb, but it really depends on where you‚Äôre at",

I was being polite cause those scallops look exceptionally beautiful and I‚Äôm always looking for any tips in the kitchen from good cooks. Remember, being kind costs you nothing. I hope you have a wonderful evening",
koz0fs3,t1_koyy7jo,1aivlfs,Bad advice. If you put wet scallops in a crowded pan you are going to steam them and not get the sear you want.,

kozc0qi,t1_koyy7jo,1aivlfs,"wow, I didn't finish reading op cooking instructions, chill the scallops for 1hr?

only 1 side is seared, set a timer, sigh, all the down votes went the wrong way, I'm too lazy to write up how to kook scallops, but yea basically your instructions is the proper way to cook scallops",
kozava5,t1_koyy7jo,1aivlfs,I'm with u on this,
kp1u07r,t1_kp1sldg,1aivlfs,"Yep, I basically do this, and even with cheap scallops from Aldi, people usually come out pretty impressed.  It's important to cook them as soon as possible after you buy them.  Or if you buy them frozen, cook them as soon as they're thawed.  They get funky if you wait too many days.

Quick rinse in sink.  Dry them with paper towel.  That part is important.

[Cut off the ""foot"".](https://www.myrecipes.com/how-to/cook-scallops)  Get pan hot. Add salt and pepper. Butter/oil in pan, add scallops. Then add a little chopped garlic/parsley after about a minute.  Flip, 2 more minutes, done.  Maybe roll them around the edges for another 30 seconds if you want the edges seared too. 

Higher-quality scallops from a local fish-monger are amazing, but even the cheap stuff is good if cooked right away, even if it seems weird to be eating a ""rare"" seafood.",
koxp1ta,t1_kox4d8o,1aivlfs,"> you want to make sure the scallops are super dry for the best sear

This cannot be understated. Dry them out with paper towels and let them sit a bit so the extra moisture seeps out. It makes a big difference.",
koza3r6,t1_koxslu8,1aivlfs,"Best I can describe they taste and feel very similar to crab meat. When they're cooked correctly, they are very tender and almost melt in your mouth like a well marbled steak. If they're overcooked, they become rubbery, so ymmv.",

Trying to dial in the egg portion of my own carbonara-inspired pasta, although I do admit to slightly bastardizing the recipe with the addition of a bit of dry vermouth and garlic. I usually use the same brand of pasta though, so curious on your egg to egg yolk to pasta ratio.

and even beyond that, freshly made pasta is not superior to dried pasta. they are two completely different products. durum wheat egg free noodles vs a common wheat product. i bet you enjoy your fresh pasta ""al dente""

Ok sometimes they do last a few days but not one small batch like those package mixes are. Not enough there and we make the cookies larger. But homemade is way better. But usually go by the recipe on the chocolate chip bag. I forgot aldi or great value brand has the better recipe. We usually follow the one with the better recipe. Whatever one that is but we make the cookies our size instead. They just take a bit longer to bake.

Sometimes we mess up the first batch. Oops should have been longer or less long in the oven but batch to is going to be perfect. Now i have it dialed in for my cookie size.

Knew a few girls who ended up with one giant cookie back when i was younger. Actually has happened more then that one time. Made the drops too big. One cookie because they ran into each other. Laugh every time i see that. Doesn't usually go to waste anyway.

Also you don't have to roll it on. Just spoon it on slide finger a cross spoon to make drops. I don't roll them into balls. Plus i don't think good cookie batter really makes a ball. Will try not to eat the raw egg batter we always would eat in the 90s. Girls I know will still sneak that raw egg cookie dough when making eggs. I stopped that years ago myself because they say it's dangerous yet so many females still sneak that bite.

Taste better than that ready to eat stuff that is found at the store with cooled pasteurized eggs and flour. And i mean it taste a lot better than the pasteurized stuff.",

Everyone has their own way of doing it but I can give you mine and these sauces are similar because the bases are often the same:¬†


You can brown chopped shallots at the beginning in 10gm of butter, some will also put a clove of garlic but others will put neither...¬†
In general, we brown chicken after that, on each side, so that the juices stick to the bottom and become brown. You can do it with veal if you want.¬†
Season lightly with a little salt, and freshly ground black pepper but do not brown the pepper!¬†


Then deglaze with broth to release the juices and obtain a sublime flavor.¬†¬†You will either use a good homemade broth (for this, simmer over very low heat for at least 12 to 24 hours, one (or more) chicken carcasses previously roasted in the oven with a little onion, garlic, salt, pepper and a bouquet garni. Filter.)¬†
But today, the vast majority of French people will simply use Maggi veal stock. 1 tbsp for 100ml of hot water.¬†


You must remove your chicken when it is cooked and then put it back at the end.¬†


After simmering the broth for 2 minutes over medium heat, add 30% semi-thick whole cr√®me fra√Æche, as well as 1 tsp of Dijon mustard (the mustard is optional).¬†
Some will however move with white wine but this is more to accompany tagliatelle than fries...


¬†You can then flavor with your favorite herbs (bouquet garnit, bay leaf, parsley...). You can add sliced ‚Äã‚Äãbutton mushrooms, it's delicious!


¬†Cook your sauce until everything is cooked and reduced, but be aware that this is not the kind of sauce that you simmer for a long time, this one is quick!¬†


At the end, sprinkle with a little pepper, and taste to adjust the salt (depending on the salt content of the broth. The veal stock is already salty.)¬†


For the chicken, here, make a marinade: butter-olive oil, minced garlic, thyme, rosemary, pepper and salt, a few drops of lemon. Marinate it well for several hours. You can stuff it with lemon, garlic, herbs and vegetables.¬†


Place it in the oven on a rack above the drip pan to collect the cooking juices and baste it with them from time to time.¬†
Do not preheat.¬†
Cook it for 1 hour at 430¬∞F.¬†
Some cook it longer at a low temperature. Some put a ramekin of broth in the oven to keep the moisture.",

lpnv7jz,t1_lpnqkhi,1fsplhu,"I will say I haven't been in France since 2016 so perhaps things have changed.

When I was in Saint Martin at a French restaurant the owner encouraged people to stay till closing giving us free banana rum she had made.

When I was in Nice France they were bringing up tables from the basements and actively encouraging it. Saying even to just sit and you did not have to order anything. Perhaps it was because we were obviously tourist.

I'm not French but my wife is Greek and in Greece they do similar of stay the whole night. Maybe even more so than France. In Greece they want more people in the restaurant because it makes the place look popular.



Regardless do they ever in France give you goddamn ""here is the time in which you have to leave"" not because we are closing but we want to rotate tables?",

lpnymvj,t1_lpnv7jz,1fsplhu,"No, things haven't changed that much since 2016, i'd say that your examples are not common practices.

Saint Martin's culture is quite different from metropolitan France's, so I can't say.

Regarding Nice's case, it definitely is not similar to most french places and Nice being highly touristy might explain it. I've seen restaurants bring more tables but it usually happens in touristy areas, especially the coastal zones because restaurants there are not open all year long and it's more in the culture.
 It will also happen in certain cities during big events such as the Braderie in Lille or maybe during really sunny days when people want to eat outside.

Most of the time, it won't happen in more ""classy"" restaurants though.

I'm not sure about asking to leave, i guess it can happen when restaurant have reservations they need to honor. It is also in the french politeness to not stay at a table for too long because the restaurant might want to rotate tables. 

Our dining culture is important to us and I'm very glad you enjoyed it !",

Talking strictly food, people in the US largely don't hang out for hours at a restaurant, but it is way more common to be at a table for hours for a party or when getting drinks. 

The only places I've seen restricting time at the table are reservation only restaurants that are very busy, and usually on the more expensive end, but even this is dependent on the night.

>all you've done is read a few things online

I literally said above that I've travelled Japan in search of ramen, and review them. I've also taken a fair few noodle making classes in Japan. I'm not as fanatic about Udon but there's a significant enough overlap that I'm confident in my assessment.

You're absolutely wrong about the size, the size plays a huge role: somen is a completely different thing; literally just thin noodles (1.3mm or smaller, generally - you're basically saying thick thin noodles). Udon are in part defined by their larger size - your Inaniwa Udon (1 of 3 main types of Udon) are close but are made flat during the process of making them. OP's are closer in texture and glossiness to Mizusawa Udon but are too thin to be these. The final type is the thick classic (and wildly more popular than the other 2 combined) Sanuki Udon. Much like Champagne, too, if they're not made in the specific regions (for Inaniwa and Mizusawa) with local produce and imported in OP's country, they're unlikely to be considered those even if they're styled after them.

To most people outside of Japan, the distinction is negligible and Udon = thick wheat noodles. To say anything else, except in specific situations where specific types are specifically imported or recreated (not OP's case), in confusing at best and ignorant at worst. Even inside of Japan, if you gave them those noodles and said ""Udon"" they'd give you funny looks.

It literally is about the size (and shape, and texture - which result from the way they're made) - the ingredients among the noodles you listed are exactly the same.

Besides, my beef with OP is more about not wanting to take on the new information (or challenge/question it, like you have!) rather than the minutiae of noodlemaking.

I wasn't even mad, just genuinely confused, and I couldn't care less about whether or not it's a ""good look"". Ironic, too, that you're saying to not get mad and correct people when all you've done is read online - when you are trying to correct me and say something as erroneous as ""somen Udon"". But yeah, school me please.",
ls0ki7i,t1_ls0k3uv,1g3hg3w,"I mean, you are too so I don't get your point? If it isn't an issue, why can't you accept that they may be different to what was listed on the package?

It looks great and I'm a huge fan of ramen (been all over Japan trying different types and have a whole IG page for reviewing them), which is why I even opened this post in the first place.

Shame on me for thinking that someone who is publicly posting about having a great dish, and is actually misnaming a part of the dish, would be interested in learning more about the dish.

Crazy, right? I should probably just downvote and move on, but I don't like doing either.",

But then when it was pointed out that they aren't, instead of questioning or accepting the new information you rejected it.

I'm not arguing or concerned about what should be put in a ramen any more than you - in fact, the Japanese themselves are extremely adventurous in what can constitute a ramen - I just found the above strange and wanted to point it out.

I'm also passionate about food, so if people say something in a public forum about one food item being another different item, I'm going to point it out.

But in my burger, I want it ""rare"". A delicious juxtaposition of a smokey and crunchy outside with a flavorful and tender inside. I love when I can tell the difference in flavor between different burger meats.

I am not a huge fan of burgers that are cooked too long, as it could quite literally be any meat. There is no difference between beef, bison, deer, elk, boar, ... Some of these might need cooking to medium, but probably not much more.

But as the saying goes ""De gustibus non est disputandum"". If you prefer your burgers cooked until uniformly grey, then that's fortunately easy enough to do",
m5t1y17,t1_m5s0k0y,1hvbwqs,"The nice thing about burgers is that the base recipe is really not that difficult. A lot of it is just in the subtle differences in techniques. And you have a lot of leeway here, based on personal preference.

For my family, I start by making super soft Yudane burger buns. The Chainbaker has a foolproof recipe. I then use good ground meat with a higher fat content; my family's favorite is bison, but that's often a little lean. So, I like to blend with ground American wagyu.

Burgers need to be lightly seasoned. Salt is the most important ingredient for thick burgers. Thinner burgers can be salted on the surface instead.

I love to add a very small amount of garlic powder, Worcestershire sauce, liquid smoke and ground pepper. Keep quantities really small. It should be barely perceptible, but it will make the meat taste meatier if done correctly.

Form patties, freeze, grill to desired doneness. Add cheese if you feel like it. My kids prefer pepper jack.

The nice thing about burgers is that they can be assemble-your-own. We serve lettuce, tomatoes, onions, dill pickles, avocado, sauerkraut, easy-over egg, sauteed mushrooms, ... As condiments, there always is at least Dijon mustard, ketchup and ""secret sauce"". The latter is made with mayo, finely chopped capers, Harissa, smoked paprika, garlic powder, and some sugar.

Serve with home-made fries and a mixed salad",

In fact, if you grind by hand (as in, with a sharp knife), you'll get a very nice texture to your patty.

But even if it's butcher bought, you don't need to worry too much. People have literally been eating steak tartar for ages -- and in much less sanitary conditions. The risk from raw beef is not as big as most people think.

But when eating medium to medium-rare cooked burger, the risk is greatly diminished, as food safety contains both a temperature and a time component. And it's pretty much impossible to not meet the time component when cooking to medium-rare.",

m5t734e,t1_m5t4ol4,1hvbwqs,"Beef is generally pretty safe to eat no matter what. Pork is a little bit more of a concern, but there hasn't been a case of trichinosis from commercially raised pork in ages; and that's really what most people worry about. These days, it's a non-issue in the US. Chicken is where you need to be careful, as it is frequently contaminated with e. coli.

With beef, as you stated correctly, you are only concerned about the possibility of surface contamination. The inside is generally safe, and that's why steaks are never a real worry no matter how you cook them. The surface area on the outside is too small and cooking destroys any residual pathogens and toxins.

With ground meat, there is the potential to bring pathogens to the inside, and to provide an environment that promotes their growth. That's why you want to grind shortly before use.

The way you do this is to buy a steak and grind it when needed, or only a few hours earlier. That would make it safe to eat as tartar. Or if you slice it, then you can eat it as carpaccio.

This doesn't require you to kill any cows. But it does require some manual work with a sharp knife or a meat grinder if you have one. Alternatively, you can ask your butcher to do that for you.

But as I said, all of this is academic. You aren't eating raw ground beef. You are eating rare gound beef that has been held at a safe temperature for at least a couple of minutes. And that makes it fit for consumption.",

Parboil quartered potatoes for 12mins, sieve and then dump a load of flour on them, beat them up a bit with a wooden spoon while flouring to create more surface area.

Once ready, take out the fat dish. Place each potato round side down. Cook for 1 hour, turning every 20 mins - round side first means two flat sides come next and easier to keep track. Season with maldon salt and rosemary.

ls4ufy0,t3_1g4lhot,1g4lhot,"The approximate recipe for those curious:

1 lb American cheese (shred this yourself, no pre-shredded)
1 lb Gouda (same, shred yourself, no pre-shredded)
8 oz mozzarella (I haven‚Äôt had issues with pre-shredded here)
4 oz cheddar (shred yourself in a perfect world, but pre shredded will work in a pinch because this is just going to be layered on top, not mixed in)
4 oz (half a bar) Philadelphia Cream Cheese
1 lb pasta (elbows here, but cavatappi or whatever short/tubular pasta you‚Äôre feeling work too)
4 Tablespoons butter
4 Tablespoons flour
1 tsp smoked paprika 
1 tsp cayenne
1 tsp ground mustard (I added this on a whim to this batch)
6 cloves garlic, crushed/pressed or minced
1 Tablespoon Worcestershire Sauce
2 cups heavy cream (I used a little more than that here to use the last of it)

I also used the remainder of the flat of a brisket I smoked Sunday, sliced and then sliced again into lardons approximately 1/3‚Äù x 1/3‚Äù x whatever the height of the flat was (think no. 2 pencil)

Preheat your oven to 400¬∞

Start off with boiling your pasta in salted water a minute less than what the box indicates for time (slightly less than al dente). If you‚Äôre doing this first and not simultaneously with the cheese sauce, drain it and mix in a little bit of extra butter so it doesn‚Äôt stick.

In a pot/deep pan over medium heat, melt the butter.

Add garlic, cook until fragrant (I‚Äôve also added finely minced/shredded onions or shallots here in addition and they‚Äôre great too)

Add paprika/cayenne/mustard, whisk well to combine. This blooms the spices and helps revitalize all the flavors in them if they‚Äôre old, and really helps distribute that flavor throughout the sauce.

Add the tablespoon of Worcestershire sauce, whisk well.

Slowly whisk in the 4 tablespoons of flour. Slowly. 1/2 a tablespoon or so at a time. Slowly. If you add all of the flour at once, it can form lumps that the melted butter never gets too, and it‚Äôll stick around until the very end and you‚Äôll end up with some weird doughy lumps. This, as many of you know, is making a roux.

Slowly drizzle in the heavy cream, whisking all the time. It‚Äôll immediately change the texture of the flour to lumpy/wet sand-ish for a bit, until you keep whisking in more cream it‚Äôll turn back into a more consistent liquid. Bring to a simmer, stirring enough so nothing is burning on the bottom of your pot/pan.

Stir in the 4 oz of cream cheese. It‚Äôs helpful to cut it into smaller pieces; it‚Äôll melt faster than just swirling around a big chunk of it. 

Stir in the American and Gouda gradually over the course of a few minutes until it‚Äôs melted. 8 oz, wait, 8 oz, wait, etc. 

Fold in your pasta (and in this case, brisket lardons)

Pour half of your pasta into an oven safe container (a 13x9 baking tray works great for this volume of pasta).

Add all the mozzarella as an awesome gooey center layer. 

Pour the second half of the pasta on top

Top with shredded cheddar (you could also top with bread crumbs/crushed crackers first, then cheddar!)

Bake in the oven for 20 minutes

Enjoy!",

Make a roux, then bechamel, then cheese sauce, add cooked pasta and chopped brisket to it, in a casserole dish or pan, breadcrumbs with butter on top, oven at 400-450 until golden. Making the cheese sauce ensures that it stays cheesy and smooth, not clumpy or hard.

lvdd9sr,t1_lvaxq5q,1gj1nz0,"Red Velvet contains 2 TBS of cocoa...so it's not a chocolate cake üòä

It is an incredibly unique cake with amazing texture and flavor when done properly! There's a cup and a half of oil, cup of buttermilk, 2 eggs, 2 c sugar, 2 1/2 c cake flour, 1 tsp vanilla, 2 TBS cocoa, 1/2 tsp salt,1 oz red color, 1 tsp vinegar and 1 tsp baking soda.

Mix all dry, except baking soda, first. 
Mix all liquid except vinegar and coloring in a separate bowl.

Combine together, then add color. Finally, mix vinegar and baking soda in a small cop/bowl...then fold into cake batter. Bake at 325 in three, prepped 9 inch pans for 20-30 minutes. Don't over bake! If you're layers start to brown? It's over done!

Cool and ice with cream cheese icing.
8 oz Cream cheese softened
1-1 1/2 sticks softened butter
1-11/2 pound powdered sugar 
1 tsp vanilla 
Pinch of salt
Cream butter and cream cheese first until fluffy! Important! Then add remaining ingredients.

Closer to $4 nowadays but still a screaming deal compared to the garbage you get at other fast food places and the overpriced mediocrity you get at ‚Äú‚Äùupscale‚Äù‚Äù places (I‚Äôm looking at you Lazy Dog)",
l6nwrdx,t1_l6n2a5h,1d5m5x4,"The fries are a funny one to me. They're usually the most maligned part of In-N-Out's menu. But they're literally the purest french fry you can get, and they're much better if you can eat them when they're freshly served (not sitting in a bag for any more than a couple minutes).

The thing with fries at other places is that they're coated in an artificial substance which allows them to keep their crispiness for longer. Plenty of fast food restaurants use a particular company to do thus, including McDonalds.

So we've basically gotten so used to fries lasting longer than they otherwise would; it used to be that you eat your fries right away lest they get soggy. But now we've been trained to expect them to last longer. And In-N-Out fries, because they refuse to update their recipes, don't use the coating everyone else uses, and their fries get soggy really fast, before a lot of people even bother to take a bite. 

And, hey, maybe this is a point to get with the times and utilize new tech in cooking recipes, and the people just want artificially propped up fries. But, say what you will, In-N-Out fries are fresh and more ""pure"", with no added preservatives to retain the crisp. 

Tl;dr: my recommendation with fries from In-N-Out is try to eat them right when they're served to you, and especially avoid letting them get soggy even quicker in a closed bag. If it takes more than even 5-10 minutes (less if they're in a closed bag) to start eating the fries after they're served, they're probably gonna taste soggy.",

There's a reason the standard technique for making french fries is a double-fry (first at low temp, then at high), because it allows you to get a soft inside and a crispy outside, and some well-respected people will argue that freezing them in between actually *improves* the texture inside.

It took 20 minutes to get through a line that only had 4 other cars. I'm not sure if that is typical but maybe that is what they were referring to by it not being fast?

Overall I wasn't impressed. As a tourist, the price is a lot less important than quality and experience so that definitely played a huge factor. 

Some things I was surprised by given the popularity:

- There wasn't a restaurant to go inside and there  were only three tables outside to eat at. So I guess most people just eat in their cars or take it home? Maybe that's specific by store, but all the locations we saw seemed to be that way. It was a bit disappointing because we were traveling and didn't really want to eat messy fast food in a rental car. 
- The fries were incredibly bland. Easily the worst fast food fries I ever had. They reminded me of store bought frozen fries. 
- The burger was fine. Very forgettable. The thing I remember most was they gave me the crunchy husk from some iceburg lettuce. 
- I was surprised they didn't have many cheese or topping options. I was expecting something more like Five Guys where you can customize your burger with lots of choices. It's fine that you couldn't, I was expecting that. 
- I found out later I was supposed to order things ""animal style"". Friends of mine swear the food is mediocre unless you order it that way. I am lost why the most popular way to order the food isn't made clear on the menu. Any other fast food restaurant you go to, the #1 combo is their signature item.

Personally I just think of it as any restaurant that is drive-through our counter service (order and get the food at the counter, not order at the counter and then be served at a table).  Essentially anything where the food is served to you as fast as possible without any additional service. Especially places that encourage take out by serving food in bags even if you plan to eat it in. Or slapping togo lids on your drinks. It's where you go to get a fast meal when you don't have time for a full service experience.

m6rh9ub,t1_m6rd546,1hzoemr,"recipe is by @backyahdbbq on tiktok but the flour wasn‚Äôt enough so i added more until it wasn‚Äôt sticky, plus i added tangzhong 

tangzhong: 
2tbsp water, 
2tbsp flour, 
4tbsp milk

mix everything on a medium heat until it becomes a paste and let it cool down.

for the dough:

400-550g flour, 
7g dry yeast, 
5g salt, 
21g sugar, 
250ml lukewarm milk (40¬∞C), 
1 egg (room temp), 
30g butter (room temp), 
1 egg yolk for brushing the buns

Start by adding the flour, yeast, and salt to a bowl and mix.

Then add the egg, milk, sugar and the thangzong.

Mix by hand or with a mixer on low for 30 secs until you get a shaggy dough. Then start kneading on medium speed for 4 minutes or by hand for 9 minutes.

Add the butter and knead for another minute.

Shape the dough into a ball.

Put the dough in an oiled container and let it double in size. About one hour.

Punch out the air so the buns don‚Äôt have big air bubbles.

Place on a floured surface and fold the sides up and over itself to shape into a ball.

Divide the dough into 80g balls. Makes about 10-12. 
Pinch and tuck each ball until smooth.
Finally shape each ball by placing it on the counter, put your claw over it, and rotate it counter clockwise a few times.
Place them all on a parchment paper lined baking sheet.
Flatten them down thin so they bake as a bun, not a ball.

Cover for an hour.

Brush the buns with a beaten egg.
Bake at 375f/190c for ~15 minutes until they turn golden brown. Cool on a wire rack.",

Most other packed meals seemed to be differentiated based on the type of bread which wraps it also, such as a wrap. The contents being a patty doesn't make it special or diverge from this pattern.

It is not clear where a 'hamburger' originates from, but it is clear that meals just like it have been eaten elsewhere since before America was a country. So to expect them to name their meals based off modern American notions is odd.

It definitely isn't due to ignorance due to the label at the grocery, even American food chains such as McDonald's and KFC call chicken in between buns a chicken burger outside of America.",

Melting butter will make a big difference on how a dough forms and should make a finer crumb iirc, as butter is an emulsion which breaks when warm, letting the dough interact with its fat much more effectively.

I know that's not directly tangzhong related but figured I'd add my two cents, in the event it's added to a batter warm.",

If you use the burger-type bread in the same way as a sandwich, it would just be called a *""name-of-filling""* roll. Like a ham and cheese roll. 

But then we complicate it as that kind of bread has a new name every c.50 miles. For example, my hometown call them a ""batch"", other local areas call them ""roll"", ""bun"", ""cob"", etc.

llvzptv,t1_llvxq80,1fas67t,"At the MN state fair they are fresh, young cheddar cheese curds battered and deep fried.

The key to making them this special, signature way, is they have to be YOUNG. Like, made within days. There are a lot of creameries in this area, mostly from western WI.

When you order them at a bar or get them from the store, they are still ok but do not even remotely taste like the curds from heaven pictured here

I know this for a reason. As a long time cheese curd fan raised in MN and regular MN fair goer, I lived in AZ for two years and no one had ever even HEARD of cheese curds. I was working for the radio station KUPD and had access to a vendor booth (if I wanted) and I did a ton of research on how I could make them like I loved back home and the answer was, after months of research, that it was essentially impossible. The proximity to cheddar creameries that produce young cheese curds like the ones pictured, is pretty much non-existent in that area, and getting them shipped would be far too expensive let alone they need to be fresh and young.

If you visit convenient stores around the WI creameries you can buy young cheese curds, made that day, in a plastic bag sitting on counters at room temperature. They are delicious even without being fried. They are famous for ""squeaking"" when you bite into them. They have a very different flavor than the curds you buy at a grocery store.

If you let them sit in your fridge for 3-4 days, suddenly, they taste like the cheddar almost everyone is used to. It really is a drastic and interesting phenomenon.

That being said... If you ever have a chance to go to the MN state fair... It is a fucking wild experience, cheese curds aside.",
