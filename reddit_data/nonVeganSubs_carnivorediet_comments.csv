l37bj7t,t3_1cndy74,1cndy74,"A tip for the electrolytes:

Get a good free form taurine supplement. I at 120lb female take 1g every 4-6 hours. 

Taurine is an osmolyte, it balances electrolytes. It is also heat sensitive.

And a tip for histamine intolerance:

If you can stomach it, try some kidney. Its high in DAO which helps to break down excess histamine.",

l3a5la7,t3_1cndy74,1cndy74,"As someone who had stage 2 non-alcoholic liver induced cirrhosis due to fatty liver and on top of that had Psoriasis and Psoriasis Arthritis, I was taking a ton of meds with horrible interactions,prescribed by the same doctor. I threw up almost daily. I'm no longer on any meds and no inflammation.  Nothing. My rheumatologist berated me for eating meat, but when I told him that I'm no longer taking my meds, he was surprised to find out that I wasn't in pain anymore. I was still sick and still in pain on meds. I once took a morphine derivative and sat down after a while, looking at the wall while drooling. I couldn't control my body at all and the pain was still there! When I told him that I was still in pain, he prescribed stronger doses or another medicine. No more! No, thank you! I'm good being pain free and meds free! So up yours, Big Pharma!",

Question has anyone had bad stomach issues from butter. There’s a lady that eats sticks as a snack. I have had it for a few days and I’m so sick. I didn’t know what was going on until I realized I haven’t been eating dairy and then I added butter and I’m swollen like a balloon. Also I am new to this. How do I transition to totally meat without having side effects.",

lqv6b0q,t3_1cndy74,1cndy74,"I’ve been carnivore 3 weeks now. First two weeks my stomach started becoming flat less bloated. For some reason this past week it’s the opposite.

I have a runny stomach and it feels and looks pretty bloated.

I Mainly eat steak, eggs and bone broth. 

I also find that I don’t have as much muscle definition as previous.

I lift weights. So staying toned and muscular is important to me. I moved into carnivore as I was mostly always bloated and had inflammation often showing up in a rash. 

I do have black coffee pre workout. Usually train fasted.

My skin feels tighter but my muscle feels soft and not hard. I’m still young (40) so I’m not in menopause. 

Any advice would be appreciated

I’ve tried everything for histamines….DAO, kidneys, BPC157.  I’m not sure what’s going on with beef really.  Even unaged beef causes a reaction.

My treatment caused nodules on my thyroid.  I seem to get histamine symptoms early on which then causes the nodules to swell.  I was certain unaged beef would be the answer but no.  

Every so often I throw in a big fat steak because one has no effect.  I mean I’m sure it does, but I don’t notice.  No itchy eyes or sneezing.  And……steak 😋",😋

l38m5gq,t1_l37fmcs,1cndy74,"My last fibroscan was 5 years ago and was 5.6.  Normal range is 2 to 7 and average is 5.2.  At end of treatment it was 12.7….just getting cirrhotic.

They don’t follow up any more, they only did follow up appointments because I was on an experimental Hep C drug.  Standard care for Hep C patients was very poor when I was being treated, so I signed up for a research program with Kings College hospital in London.

With my current knowledge, I may not have done that.  But I trusted they would fix it 😬

I did get the best diagnostics and doctors there though.  Standard care they just use ultrasound to scan the liver, which isn’t good enough.  When I had mine, they said it was fine.  3 weeks later after a fibroscan, they were apologetic about the diagnosis because my liver was compromised and promising they’d do all they could. 🤷‍♀️

So, good in some ways…..but heaven only knows what I took for 6 months.",😬🤷♀

Thank you for your honesty about food addiction. I feel exactly the same way - I am sailing through life as a carnivore (no cheats) but I still think about food often and sometimes binge on extra palatable carnivore foods like cheese, pork rinds, dairy in general. 

Do you feel like carnivore allows you some space for self reflection? Other diets I had to white knuckle and honestly, rarely stuck to them long enough to have time to self reflect. On carnivore, there is a mental peace that allows me to have revelations about how, when, and most importantly, why, I eat.

m5tahf6,t3_1hv5y1e,1hv5y1e,"I have been on Carnivore for just on 8 weeks now. I was a bit overweight- 56yr old, 172cm and 70kg and yes I have lost weight (I vow never to weigh myself again but figure around 4 kilo), it seems a lot of water from inflammation but body fat is going too - it’s a bit like when ice pieces melt in warm water, you can see patchy fat deposits rather than solid layers. This woman is so right about Carnivore and emotional attachment to food. I was a real foodie, great cook and loved, loved, loved food and always really looked forward to a delicious meal, pulled out all stops to create a gourmet meal. Since Carnivore eating I have lost that emotional attachment to food. I was so worried about getting bored and not being able to stay on track but it’s nothing like that. I still enjoy my meals but my brain now aims to get the most nutrient dense food I can get when I choose what I eat. Eating is now just a means to fuel up and get nutrients in. I make sure I have boiled eggs and Carni snacks in the fridge but I pretty much eat a steak (around 160grms) an egg and two slices of bacon and a small slice of home made Carni bread with tallow and butter for breakfast and don’t get hungry again until around 4.30-5pm and I’ll have a top up boiled egg. Dinner is a piece of protein (rack lamb, steak, fish, chicken thighs, hamburgers with liver) eggs/bacon again and make sure I make up approx 125grms fat a day (additional to my other fatty cuts of meat). I cut up small discs of butter and press them into cacao powder mixed with a little monk fruit and freeze them - so good and makes it a breeze to make the fat quota for the day. My Ulcerative Colitis is improving and I don’t crave carbs/sweets anywhere as much anymore (or enjoy them as much if I do sneak a chip or potato something). My brain seems to now understand nutrition and I have no interest in “entertainment” food. 
Dr Elizabeth Bright has done some interesting interviews and I’m pretty much eating as she does with 4 drops of Lugols iodine a day. 
I will get my bloods done in a couple of months to see how my health is tracking but it is the easiest eating plan I have ever tried. My shopping time during the week has reduced dramatically and also the cooking time (4 minutes to cook, 4 mins to clean), it’s a no brainer when you are saving hours upon hours a week. Hands down the easiest eating style.",

Even though the many positives of eating carnivore make it 100% worth it, I definitely do feel there is a hole in life after taking carbs out, but I've been working on building up hobbies and interesting to put in that gap instead. 

I don't think I will ever have a normal relationship with non-carnivore food because I could never moderate with carbs, ever. I can't remember a time when there wasn't a compulsive eating dynamic with sugar/carbs. I've never been able to view them the way naturally slim people who can moderate view them, my brain and body seem to have a really strong reaction to them - I can only liken it to being an alcoholic who cannot understand how other people just have 1 small glass of wine or something. Alcoholi is for getting drunk = Carbs are for binging. I'm in my mid 30s now and it's taken my this long to just totally accept I cannot moderate with carbs.  

I also relate a lot to what you mention about being confronted food non-stop if you want any social life (and it's carbs so much of the time). It is a challenge. Anyway, congrats again, I love seeing stuff like this.",

m6adyoq,t3_1hv5y1e,1hv5y1e,"Allen carr has resources that can help with the addiction part, however the foods he suggests are not carnivore foods, so I don't pay attention to that part. I used him to quit overspending and to quit cigarettes very happily and effectively. 

He might be wrong about which foods because he created the program years ago and had old data, but he isn't wrong about the method for curing addiction. It really works. 

I'd hate to think of you doing so much good for your body and achieveing so much without relishing every minute of your new life and healthy choices with joy! 

I'll summarize  his method maybe it will help, my intention is that you get validation in your struggle and a light at the tunnel that choosing health can be happy and you don't have to suffer in isolation like a monk (ironically monks probably choose not to suffer) -

Method summary :

( Take your mind, there is a big craving monster and a little craving monster. 

The de-programing was really useful for me. Try to open your mind to the fact that quitting junk food can feel easy and exciting. 

When you quit something the hunger pangs, sugar withdrawal etc are the little monster. The big monster represents the bigger harder aspect which is your desire to eat the unhealthy stuff.

 You don't have to struggle to quit anything unless you quit without killing the both monsters. (Getting ride of the brainwashing and actually stopping whatever you were addicted to.) 

You wouldn't give a lil toddler ground up McDonald's in the form of baby food and would instantly recognize that it isn't ideal nutrition, that basically it's poison food. So, why are you craving it then? 

Advertisements, money, greed, corporations that don't care about your health or happiness. 

Understanding that those other foods are unnatural, toxic, and that we have been basically advertised and brainwashed since early childhood by big marketing campaigns into thinking they are healthy, delicious, and desirable that they make us feel good when you know they make you tired, sick, moody, and unhappy. 

You've done an amazing job with willpower so far! Congratulations on everything you have achieved. You are a very strong minded person to keep tackling this problem time and time again.

 You're just using a challenging method to stop by using will power alone, because you still buy into the marketing platform that you are ""missing out"" when you skip these foods. There's nothing wrong with you and you are no more an addict than others still caught in the marketing trap. 

I guarantee that your friends are looking at your carnivore body in envy and are unintentionally probably unconsciously trying to get you to be addicts again with them. Key words unintentionally and unconsciously. I'm sure your friends live you and outwordly want to support you, but change is hard, they miss you and blame the resitrictive diet! It's not their fault they are trapped in the same trap you're halfway to escaping! Pity them for still being trapped in the brainwashing since you know carnivore is the best diet for you and you can see and feel the results! 

If you choose to look at those toxic fake processed foods with disgust and feel excited and grateful to have escaped the trap of mindless toxic eating the rest of the population has fallen for- basically when you go out with friends and they offer you foods you used to eat, you'll sooner crave a plate of bleach and cigarette butts. You can still enjoy your life with friends, without ""enjoying"" the hot disgusting toxic garbage they shovel into their mouths.

You can joyfully start today without any extra work than a big change in perspective!) 

That is a short rough summary of his process. I hope it reaches you in the hopeful tone I have intended.",

Other diets I had to white knuckle and honestly, rarely stuck to them long enough to have time to self reflect. On carnivore, there is a mental peace that allows me to have revelations about how, when, and most importantly, why, I eat.""  
  
  
  
This is such an incredible way to put it—I hadn’t even thought about it like that! With other diets, I was always so focused on just “getting through the day” or planning some elaborate meal that I didn’t actually *enjoy* much of the process. Mental peace is such a hard thing to achieve when food dominates your thoughts, and you’re right—on carnivore, there’s just *so much time*. Without constantly obsessing over what to eat next, I’ve found myself reflecting a lot more on how I treat my body and why I make the choices I do. I love that you brought this up—it really resonates!",
m5wf6bb,t1_m5t41ex,1hv5y1e,"I've been reading more about the strict carnivore/lion diet, and I really like the idea of going that route. I think I’ll be starting it soon. Also, we’re totally in the same boat with lower back problems—I haven’t had *any* issues in months! I don’t even need to take Motrin or Tylenol regularly anymore, and I used to take them a few times a day.

Right now, I’m on hormone replacement therapy patches because I’m going through perimenopause. I’ll be honest—this diet didn’t help at all with my “women’s” issues, like mood swings, cramp severity, or regularity. I know you didn’t ask, but I just wanted to share my experience in case it helps you. For me, I had to explore other options for those issues.

I also don’t drink alcohol anymore. I used to socially, but now I don’t feel the need to fit in by drinking when I go out or to people’s houses. Honestly, I love being able to drive myself and leave when I want instead of relying on Uber or making someone be the DD. It’s so freeing.

And YES, I work out, but I didn’t start right away. I lost about 50 lbs first, and then I eased into it. I started by walking 30 minutes about five times a week, and now I do an hour of VR Beat Saber every day. It’s crazy how much easier it’s become over time—I just let it happen naturally.",

Ground beef, all types of steak, bacon, ham, all parts of the chicken including hearts and liver, turkey breast, shrimp, crab, lobster, butter I make from heavy cream and buttermilk, eggs (chicken, duck, quail), and cheese. (Now that I typed that, I do not think that is considered part of the lion diet.)",
m5wjzon,t1_m5tahf6,1hv5y1e,"I love the term ""entertainment food""—I’m absolutely stealing that! It perfectly describes how so many of us used to think about meals. And you’re so right about shopping and cooking time. I’ve noticed the same thing—it feels like I’ve gained so much time back for things that actually matter.

It’s amazing how this way of eating shifts your mindset around food. Like you, I was worried about getting bored, but now I look at meals differently. It’s about fueling my body, not entertaining my emotions. I still enjoy what I eat, but there’s this freedom in not being *obsessed* with creating the ""perfect"" dish or meal all the time.

Your routine sounds so dialed in! I love the idea of the cacao butter discs with monk fruit—what a clever way to hit your fat intake. And that lineup of proteins you eat? Total goals. I might have to give some of those ideas a try.

Also, it’s inspiring to hear about your progress with Ulcerative Colitis. I’m starting to see similar benefits with inflammation and just overall health, which makes sticking to this way of eating feel like a no-brainer. I’ll have to check out Dr. Elizabeth Bright; she sounds fascinating.

It’s awesome to hear how much easier life feels for you now—it’s such a testament to how effective and sustainable this can be!",
m5x7wf8,t1_m5ta0un,1hv5y1e,Heck yes! Let's do this!,
m5wltat,t1_m5tefsr,1hv5y1e,"I’m not concerned about coronary artery disease being caused by this diet. My previous eating habits were never questioned, even though I lived off fries, sugary sodas, and every fast food you can think of. That lifestyle left me pre-diabetic, with high cholesterol, constant knee and back pain, and honestly, just feeling terrible most of the time.

Switching to this way of eating has been a game-changer for me. My bloodwork is now amazing, and I feel healthier than I have in years. I’m able to hike and exercise like I did in my 20s, which I never thought would happen again.

As for the difference between carnivore, keto, and Atkins, the biggest distinction is that carnivore cuts out almost all carbs entirely. Keto and Atkins allow for breads, grains, and other low-carb products marketed toward those diets, which can feel more flexible. But for me, those kinds of foods made it easier to slip back into old habits. Eating something that mimicked the foods I was trying to avoid only reignited my cravings and pulled me back toward that addictive relationship with food. Carnivore keeps it simple—meat, eggs, animal fats—and that’s what has worked for me.

Now, I’m not a doctor (obviously), but this approach has been life-changing for me. What first got me curious was a book called *Stay Off My Operating Table: A Heart Surgeon’s Metabolic Health Guide to Lose Weight, Prevent Disease, and Feel Your Best Every Day* by Dr. Philip Ovadia. It’s a great read if you want to learn more about heart health and how diet impacts it.

If you’re seriously considering starting one of these diets, I’d recommend doing a little research and seeing what resonates with you. Everyone’s body is different, but for me, this has been transformative.",
m5wg4qe,t1_m5tvux9,1hv5y1e,"I feel like food addiction isn’t talked about enough. It’s so hard to explain to people who don’t get it—what it’s like to stop and grab fast food and eat it in your car so your partner doesn’t see. Or turning off your location so they don’t notice how many different places you went for food in a day. Having enough money to buy food, but not pay your bills. Or “pretending you didn’t eat something” just so you don’t have to count the calories from it.

I want people to feel safe and know they’re not alone—food addiction is *real*. There’s no shame in it, but I do want to encourage people to do whatever they can to fight it and take back control. I don’t know if that made total sense, but really, I just want people to know they’re not alone in this.",

YES!! When you're not completely consumed by food thoughts, you have so much more free time! I’ve been filling that time with crafts and thrift shopping. It’s amazing how much more time I have to enjoy life and all the fun stuff that comes with it. My brain isn’t constantly in “food mode” anymore. I never realized how much of my time was spent thinking about food, and I’m guessing that comes from the addiction.

m5wo7ol,t1_m5swyrq,1hv5y1e,"I’m doing this solo and keeping it as simple as humanly possible so it’s easy to stick with. I totally get feeling weird about it—I did too at first. But honestly, just like trying out a new medication, sometimes you have to give it a shot and see how it works for you. Four months might seem like a long time, but if you’re already familiar with your body, you’ll know pretty quickly if it’s a good fit. For me, the benefits have massively outweighed any downsides.

When it comes to macros, I don’t bother with any of that. Trying to track numbers, follow strict plans, or calculate anything turns me off so fast I’d quit before I even started. Too many rules make it feel like a chore, and I’m just not here for that.

Here’s my rule of thumb for Carnivore:

* If it’s fresh meat, eat it.
* If it’s in a can, don’t.
* If it’s frozen and covered in sauce, skip it.
* Fast food? Avoid it if you can. But if you’re stuck in an emergency, you can make it work—just be super selective.

Keeping it simple has made this diet so much easier to follow, and it’s been a game-changer for me. No complicated rules, no math, just fresh, straightforward eating.",

* Shopping in ""small people clothes stores"" and actually being able to find things that fit—and not hating every second of it.
* Saving so much money on food—seriously, it’s crazy how simple and affordable this way of eating can be.
* My skin has cleared up, and I don’t wake up bloated anymore—like, at all.
* I sleep like a baby now. No more tossing and turning all night or waking up still feeling tired.
* My knees and back don’t hurt anymore, which means I can get up and move around without feeling like I’m 90 years old.
* No more brain fog—I actually feel sharp and focused, and it’s like my mind finally works the way it’s supposed to.
* I have so much more energy—I’m not crashing in the afternoon or relying on caffeine just to keep going.
* I’m fitting into old clothes that I thought I’d never wear again, and it feels so good to *not* have to size up anymore.
* I feel stronger, like I can do things I haven’t been able to in years—whether it’s hiking, lifting something heavy, or just making it through the day without feeling wiped out.

m5zcr3l,t1_m5xcjel,1hv5y1e,"Yes definitely, I am the same, I have just been learning how to crochet from YouTube videos lately and it's so much fun!

Going out to eat with family/friends, or even just going to a cafe for a tea or coffee, it's a bit of a double edged sword because on the one hand I'm having a lot of new experiences where instead of being focused on food, I'm forced to focus on other stuff, and that leads to the whole experience having a really different feeling, as I really tune completely into conversation with the person I'm with, but also the atmosphere of the cafe, and people-watching, and just feeling very present. It's very interesting. The whole experience feels really different when you take food out of it.

But then sometimes I'll feel resentful about having to go out to those places because it's so much about this substance I am addicted to and trying to recover from - and yeah... Very, very food-focused, everyone enthusing about the food, and awkwardness when I don't get anything and join in often followed by unwelcome questions and advice!

That takes some zen mastery to sort of ""ride the wave"" and put your attention on those other things lol So a mixture of zen on the one hand, and then sometimes still feeling quite strong resentment of ""Ugh why can everyone else eat this stuff but not me? Why can't I be 'normal' like them? Why am I the one with these food issues?"" etc. - just feeling a lot of emotion like that, which when I stand back I feel is coming from my addict brain just screaming a bit about not getting to do the thing it most wants to do. Like an alcoholic visiting a bar with friends but I can only order a sparkling water or whatever, I imagine there's a similar mixture of the addict brain pitching a fit VS the new ""zen"" brain that is soaking in the situation and just being present and calm...

Food noise on carbs was awful. I agree with you 100%, it's so quiet in my head now and there's a feeling of just a lot of space freed up in my brain. Oh how I wish I'd discovered carnivore back when I was 19 years old or something, I honestly think my life would have been drastically different. I really struggled so much with food and body image issues. Now finally some peace, yay!",
m5slwdr,t1_m5rcpge,1hv5y1e,"I do not do macros. When I tried doing that I just got frustrated if I didn't hit goals, so instead I eat until I am not hungry anymore. Example of my food today with really bad descriptions of size/weight.

Breakfast - 2 eggs over easy cooked in bacon fat

Lunch - ground beef with cheddar cheese (like half of a small bowl filled with the meat and a handful of cheese.) I also do not drain the fat from my beef when I cook it. 

Dinner - probably 1 & 1/2 chicken breast with my favorite spices (cumin, smoked paprika, salt, pepper, chili powder.) 

My face routine - I drink a lot of water and use Philosophy Purity face wash.  \*lol\* Nothing fancy there, but I did notice the change about 5 months in after starting carnivore.",
m5sn1ob,t1_m5smnra,1hv5y1e,Yeah but your body can fluctuate 2 lbs from water intake so a daily weigh in for me screws my head up if I see that gain has a very negative effect on my psychi but I guess everyone is different weekly weigh ins is what i have always done and been successful through previous cuts but i was just curious glad it works for you,

lol on Macros #whatarethese 😂 but a bunch of frustrations .. so far for me. I know that many thrive on experimenting, applying strictly, consuming and living strictly by them. 

As for use of spices, kudos! 
I know it goes against the Carnivore (purist approach) however they regulate my sanity by alleviating the feeling like I am depriving myself considering we have eaten all sorts of ethnic foods and flavor profiles even when svelte for as ever as I can remember in my family from my wee years.",😂

m64lok8,t1_m64kv8l,1hv5y1e,"Yeah, I can't find unprocessed ham. I mean so go to the store where they have the big blocks and slice it up for you, but they probably have carbs as well.",

I guess I’m more carnivore-*ish*. *lol* I honestly had no idea! This whole time, I thought I was strict because I don’t drink coffee or soda, and I don’t add veggies or fruits to my meals.

Since I’ve had so much success this way, I’ll probably stick to it for now, but thank you for explaining more about the purist approach. I’m definitely going to read more and see if there are changes I’d want to make. I love the idea of trying carnivore in a new way—it keeps things interesting!",

If it ain’t broken…. 🙌

I simply mentioned the spices as non carnivore as it’s a Reddit on Carnivore, and 
recently many posts deviate. 
Purists of purists are against all but Salt. 

Some spices create some metabolic / hormonal / Oxalates imbalance however your progress and health show that the ones you are using are supporting your journey to your Health.",🙌

I get that for some people the strict approach is best, but for many allowing yourself some small deviations makes the diet sustainable, and at the end of the day the WOE that works is the one that you can stick to.",

And sure, In the beginning, I was eating lots of beef and lamb. Just salt, no butter. It was about 4-5lbs a day. Now, I mostly eat about 3lbs/day and predominantly beef. I do have lamb sometimes if it's on sale. Still no butter for now...or added fat because the meat is fatty enough.

For the cuts:

Lamb is usually Lamb shoulder

Beef, I get a whole box of chuck rolls from Costco for about $4.19/lb. I but it up as if I were slicing a ribeye roast. It lasts us 1 week.

  
Every now and then, I'll down about 10 raw quail eggs.",

The first picture is at the end of winter so I was more pale. I spent time outside in the summer without a shirt, soaking in as much as I could (grilling, working on the yard). 

Second, I'm half Greek so I tan easier.

Last, I'm not as worried about the sun with his WOE.

Keep with it man, you got this!

I've heard that every body is different.  Some people even put on weight before losing.  I suspect it might also have to do with the low T and low-level insulin-resistance (since I'm at 107 each morning when I'm eating).",

Here in the photo, I'm about 255lbs. in the past, I've been as low as 225-230lbs (calorie restricted). The medical ""experts"" say a healthy 6'7"" male should weigh 152-204lbs.

Dinner was my next meal. Usually, my wife would make us a casserole (including heavy cream & cheese), maybe some skin-on chicken, or salmon (skin on) or stir-fry cauli-rice. We always had broccoli, cauliflower, or spinach. Occasionally, we had bell-peppers or onions. 

  
Snack time was bad. I would eat a bowl of Whisps with some pork rhinds and some salted, roasted nuts. Sometimes, I'd add in the Wilde protein chips or some sausage sticks from country archer. at first, I was doing some keto ice cream too but that was addictive so I quit. Still gained weight. even when I quit snacking.",

lq9ba4d,t1_lq7a9pt,1fverxv,"Very interested in autophagy and it’s very cool to see it work so well for you. Your results are inspiring. Just to clarify, you fast for 3 days a week and then eat 3 lbs of beef on your non fasting days? How many meals per day do you break that into? And how do your workouts fit into that eating schedule.

lq8ox3k,t1_lq8l3bw,1fverxv,"Strict since May, I do the occasional cheese, 90 grams tops once a week.  But not often.  No dairy other then that, no sweeteners.  This week I added 200ish grams of fruit, 40 grams of carbs for a few days to test how I felt.  Zero difference, so I went back to strict carnivore.  

I'm getting leaner, I'm pretty sure lol.

Might possibly do a fast next week, haven't done one in a while since I started working out.  My appetite has just been wild.",
lq858rd,t1_lq849us,1fverxv,"Difference between carnivore and animal based would mainly be eating fruit and honey, pretty well as much as you want but try to gauge the amount with exercise. Paul Saladino is the goat, take some notes from that man and everything is easier",

lq802j2,t1_lq7y2jl,1fverxv,Way Of Eating,
lqsqsjp,t1_lq9ba4d,1fverxv,"Sorry, I thought I replied! Thank you! Yes, I fast 3 days each week (rarely, 4) and break my fast with some homemade bone broth. I will usually then have about 1.5lbs of chuck steak. I do one 1.5lbs chuck around 11am or 12 noon, and another around 5:30 or 6:30. I don't weigh it and I share some with my toddler (who usually wants all the fat :) so it's difficult to say exactly how much I'm eating. 

For my workouts, I workout fasted. Towards the end of the 3 days, sprinting can be a little tougher, but resistance seems easier. I definitely have to pace myself with the wind-exercises or I get light-headed.",
lq89exc,t1_lq87cg4,1fverxv,"Thanks! Yes. 

Monday is Leg Day. I do 4 sets of squats, 6-8 reps (as much weight as I can).

Tuesday, Thursday, and Saturday, I stretch, do a light jog, do 4 sets of pull-ups (in a park) and start sprinting for 12 seconds. I do 20 rounds of that. Then another 8 sets of pull-ups. After this, I do a club-bell workout for about 20 minutes. You can find them online.

Wednesday: Pull Day. I do 4 sets of pull-ups, 4 sets of seated rows, 4 sets of lat-pull-downs, 3 sets of reverse-grip lat pull-downs, 4 sets of lateral cable raises (each arm), 4 sets of seated DB lateral raises, 4 sets of reverse-flys 4 sets of upright barbell rows, 4 sets of shoulder shrugs (behind back), 4 sets of bent-over rows, 4 sets of incline DB curls, 4 sets of hammer-curls, and 4 sets of preacher curls. Again, as much weight as I can do 6-8 reps (no more) from.

lq8wvgo,t1_lq8ox3k,1fverxv,"Makes sense. You could be recompositioning too. I got real hungry at that part. Fasting will probably help. 
Sometimes hormones are a factor too. But I honestly try not to focus on the scale, or some random number. More how I feel and look.


I do measure my waist for a WTHR though.  At .54 now, trying to get to .5",
lq85vke,t1_lq858rd,1fverxv,"I see. Thanks for explaining. I've never really had much of a sweet-tooth...even as a kid. My wife would love the Saladino style. I may slowly add in some of our home-grown fruits, but that will be a long way off as the first plant-foods I'll add back in (once I get results I want) are herbs/spices.",

lq9auvd,t1_lq8dkbr,1fverxv,I don’t know what state he is in but here in Georgia you don’t have to have a doc sign off on an MRI. You have MRI clinics where you just go yourself and you pay out-of-pocket. Don’t need permission from anybody.,

One thing i use to do beaps was hiking and gain good leg muscles and good cardio.",
lqdh9g5,t1_lq85vke,1fverxv,"Hell yeah home grown pesticide free fruits would be a great play. I only strongly suggest moving into animal based rather than ketogenic carnivore due to my personal experience, spend enough time in ketosis and your hormones will eventually pay the price. Plus animal based you still get to enjoy the finer things in life, like banana pancakes (1 banana, 2 eggs mashed up) with maple syrup and bacon. Though I do refrain from eating pig and chicken so that breakfast is like a monthly treat at most",

lqep1tm,t1_lqdvj6t,1fverxv,Pink salt usually helps with cramping... Or pickle juice,
lqldhlt,t1_lqci7v6,1fverxv,There are some theories that it's either the lack of seed oils or vegetables that make people not sunburn as easily.,
lqdsu0l,t1_lqci7v6,1fverxv,There's just something about it. People just don't burn easily...unless you're out all afternoon maybe. But you heal quickly ,

lqdslun,t1_lqdh9g5,1fverxv,"Thanks! Yeah, due to 107 glucose every day, my ketones are usually about .1mmol
So I'm only in ketosis day 2 and 3 of my fast. But eventually I will add things in one at a time (this will take years). And even then, the plan is to eat more closely to how our ancestors did (seasonally,  locally,  special occasions and lots of physical activities)!",

lqhokr5,t1_lqep1tm,1fverxv,Thanks. I do Redmond's Real salt and Himalayan.  I still get them though. It's not all the time either (sometimes weeks in between) so I suspect oxalate dumping. Haven't tried pickle juice.  Does it have to be pickle juice or is ACV okay?,
lqk4hxb,t1_lqhbism,1fverxv,How's your electrolytes intake looking?,
lqkimf7,t1_lqhokr5,1fverxv,I've not tried ACV for cramping so I'm not positive. I heard about pickle juice when I was pregnant and it does wonders when my muscles are aching or cramping.,

m737vi3,t1_m6yr5qj,1i0jjez,Sounds like your body is detoxing. Don’t give up. Push through it and the weight loss will come. Everyone is different. I’m only 43 days in and have only lost 10 lbs. I’m also in perimenopause. I feel amazing and mood has improved and I have so much energy. Drink water. Use real salt like Redmond real salt. I drink Sole water every morning. It’s just a mixture of salt water and that helps. Good luck! You got this!,

m6zth5u,t1_m6ziisw,1i0jjez,"I’ve been taking magnesium/potassium daily but not the others. And I was just counting protein at first and just decided 3 days ago to count everything. I’m getting about 2,000 calories … I weigh 163 right now, I should weigh 125-130 which is why I started this as I’ve been eating clean for months and just holding my weight but I put it on pretty fast with 3 cross country moves in 16 months so I’m guessing stress induced the weight and I’m hoping carnivore will drop it back off. I’m comfortable with my total calories and am eating roughly 145-160 grams of protein each day and the rest is fat.",

And 4 or so hours later I’ll have a half a steak. I tend to stick to NY Strip steaks. I’ve had several filet mignon lately just because we had them. Weirdly enough, I feel better when I eat lower fat. Never saw that coming after everything I’ve heard/seen others say. I’m just eating intuitively and fully expect it to change as I go. Oh, and I have a cup of bone broth here and there as well.",

When I started out (and I was burdened by many health issues, quite ill), I still ate a kilo or 2 pounds of fatty red meat, and now I've decreased it to about 800 g as I don't need as much, but I can eat way more if need be without ill effects.",
m18z9vz,t1_m18yz2x,1hadifo,"Yep, lots of meat or seafood stews, yum",
m1cg6fj,t1_m18yz2x,1hadifo,"What crockpot stew recipes do you do? I’ve been looking into this. 
I have a hard time imagining a nice carnivore stew without the potatoes, carrots, onions, parsley…",
m1ca84h,t1_m184wmz,1hadifo,"You’re looking great my dude! Whatever it is, it’s clearly working for you.",
m18x0mu,t1_m18ewyl,1hadifo,"Exactly, humans can’t digest fibre so it has to ferment in our guts giving off gas. That person is a vegan troll",
m1ca5f7,t1_m18hra1,1hadifo,Roquefort for sure.,
m1d566f,t1_m1cfkqr,1hadifo,I think I would like to try carnivore and vegetables rather than just carnivore. I can definitely see the merit in cutting out carbs.,
m197r49,t1_m18tudw,1hadifo,how much is your free T?,
m180hvc,t1_m17zqaw,1hadifo,"Actually i have been tracking every single calorie i eat for 2 weeks while doing 2 mad and my weight didn’t move . I am 15 % bf working out 5 X a week . 21 m

Any tips ?",
m17xzgi,t1_m17wpl3,1hadifo,I get milk from a small local diary and also take colostrum daily.,
m1ce0qa,t1_m17wpl3,1hadifo,"Because raw milk, i.e., unpasteurized milk, can harbor dangerous germs that can pose serious health risks and cause Salmonella, E. coli, Listeria, Campylobacter, and others. 

That risk isn’t for everyone.",
m17w1ey,t1_m17ujkx,1hadifo,"Raw milk and raw cheese for me as well. I have always been in decent shape, but the facial inflammation is shocking. I look way better already. My face is way more defined after only 3 months.",
m1cld14,t1_m1cg6fj,1hadifo,"Slowcook big chunks of meat in it's own fat with bone broth. I like giving it a good sear beforehand as well. 

Stews don't work well with carnivore. 

My favourite crockpot cuts:

- chuck roast
- beef checks
- pork neck
- pork shoulder
- pork butt
- Osso Bucco

Pork neck steaks are the best. Juicy and tender. Don't overdo pork neck. Shouldn't fall apart, instead maintain it's shape. Chuck roast is a different story.",
m1cai2l,t1_m1ca84h,1hadifo,Try it. You will look and feel better.,
m1cc6lu,t1_m1ca5f7,1hadifo,That is not normal though.. If I were you I would check if you have lactose intolerance. Gas is a typical symptom.,
m1id0fs,t1_m1d566f,1hadifo,"Go for it. I did that for a while and it was nice. I like veggies, and only really cut them out to see what would happen. Mostly what happened was I didn't have to spend time prepping veggies lol 

I thought I was a lazy chef before, but carnivore has ruined me 😅",😅
m19rclv,t1_m197r49,1hadifo,Around 30 pg/mL,
m180yxq,t1_m180hvc,1hadifo,Hard to say. Are you counting during the weekend as well? Usually people let off during the weekend and undo the progress made during the rest of the week.,
m1ce2ho,t1_m17xzgi,1hadifo,"As in, newborn baby colostrum? How much does that even cost?",
m1cjgd7,t1_m1ce0qa,1hadifo,"That risk is overblown. 

If you react bad to it because of an intorelance, don't drink it. Use your common sense, see what works for you.",
m1cm9l6,t1_m1cld14,1hadifo,"Thank you sir! Haven’t tried pork neck yet.

I got a bit confused tho, if stews don’t do well with Carnivore why do them at all? Isn’t crockpot a stew based meal?",
m1817mp,t1_m180yxq,1hadifo,Every single day even on rest days i decrease my cals,
m181afj,t1_m180yxq,1hadifo,Do you think too much protein maybe the cause ?,
m1ch7y5,t1_m1ce2ho,1hadifo,"Bovine colostrum.  It’s not bad, about $40 for a 60 day supply",
m1cmt2d,t1_m1cm9l6,1hadifo,"You can use the crockpot for more than just stews. That's part of the convenience. Pot roasts (braised) are ideal for crockpots imo. 

Stews are heartier and take less time. You can use law carb veggies, heck even potatoes. If you feel good about it, why not?",
m18r7y2,t1_m1817mp,1hadifo,"If you undereat, you can stump your metabolism and start gaining or maintaining weight. This is because your body anticipates a famine or lack of food, which causes it to store body fat. You should eat to satiety and when meat stops tasting good.",
m181nrj,t1_m1817mp,1hadifo,"Genuinely no clue. Either you miscount the amount of calories you really consume and/or consume too many carbs in combination with high fat. I doubt you miscount and eat too much, though possible.

High fat and carb combo kills weight loss. The scale will just move up quickly.",
m1dmdex,t1_m1cmt2d,1hadifo,Yes true! Thx I don’t own a crockpot. But looking to.,
m18rm3c,t1_m18r7y2,1hadifo,Maybe omad will be the answer,
m182c3c,t1_m181nrj,1hadifo,What did you ate most of the time?,
m182nfy,t1_m181nrj,1hadifo,"I think too much protein is just like consuming carbs because it stimulates insulin 

I will try decreasing it a little bit",
m18t716,t1_m18rm3c,1hadifo,"And there's no need to count calories; it's very inaccurate anyway. We eat food, not calories, as you know. Try OMAD and eat fatty red meat, preferably lion diet, since you said your weight is stubborn. Might also be beneficial to get a thyroid panel to peer into your metabolism as an underactive thyroid can make your weight persistent.",
m183kp8,t1_m182nfy,1hadifo,"Could be. Have no experience with excessive protein. Ate pretty equal ratio's of fat and protein.

Prioritising protein over fat could have negative consequences I heard, not sure for weight loss but possibly keeping the stubborn weight.",
m1cwa70,t1_m18t716,1hadifo,I did it.  although eating more cals my weight was down 0.4 kg,

My brother got me on this diet and he went from 260 to 200 in just a couple months. I’ve tried putting my fat to protein ratio 2:1, and don’t understand why i can’t get into ketosis. Going to stick with it for a few more months and see.",

m6aty8g,t1_m6aslp4,1hwxkvl,"You might wanna redo your research on that. 100g of ground beef has about 350mg of creatine in it. Following a strict carnivore diet ( red meats only ), you'll only get between 1 to 2 grams of creatine. Less if you're not strict, which is a far cry from the 5gs you need on a daily basis, especially if you are working out heavy. So yea, if you're not working out and fat loss is your only goal, then you don't need it, but if you're looking to recomp your body and add moderate to significant muscle, you need an extra creatine source.",

m6b9z8u,t1_m6aty8g,1hwxkvl,"It seems there are many different numbers floating around...

But anyway, with your numbers, 2g would be 570g of beef. Most people will eat more than that in a day, especially if they want to build muscle. If they additionally eat other meats or fish, those also have creatine, albeit in usually lower concentration. If someone includes dairy, milk has almost no creatine but cheese has some.

And also I disagree with your framing that creatine is somehow necessary (different story for people on a traditional bodybuilding diet). Yes it's quite useful, let's you go a bit further and from my experience also recover faster, but you can be fine without it.",

m6bbwa5,t1_m6b9z8u,1hwxkvl,"


Why would you want to eat more to get a gram or two more creatine in? Your logic makes no sense. Weight loss no matter the diet revolves  around calories in vs calories out?  Red meat is generally higher in calories, so eating more and risking going over your calorie intake makes absolutely zero sense. Even if you're working g out like a mad man, you're gonna have to eat even more.... so why not add a supplement that adds nothing but benefits and helps your weight loss journey with no negative. Also, two people on a carnivore diet strict  one meal a day, maybe two, like most people do go to the gym 3/ 4 times a week for a minimum of 1 hour per day. One supplements creatine the other doesn't  i promise you the one adding creatine will see much better results and faster. Creatine isn't a new fad and has more than enough studies to back that scenario.  Why you are trying to pick a fight over something yourself find beneficial is beyond me... idk, maybe you're a typical reddit user who just wants to troll and argue for no reason. End of the day do you, buddy.",

kz0r82j,t1_kz0o1s7,1c10jfi,"Yeah I’ve already spent $200 on athletic shorts and leggings, been able to get away with wearing the same shirts they’re just more baggy now. And I’ve already bought a new pair of tennis shoes since I have the energy to actually go out and walk now!",

kz0xvqs,t1_kz0op2a,1c10jfi,"I bet you will get just that! So far basically every issue I’ve had has been resolved, just give it time and try to commit to 90 days straight. The first few weeks you won’t feel great most likely, you’ll be loosing a lot of water and when you loose water you loose electrolytes, make sure and take a sugar free, flavor free electrolyte like keto chow or something during that first 3 weeks- month of so, it’ll make a world of difference, after you get past those initial few weeks you’ll start to feel amazing! You’ll really notice the consistent amazing feeling by the end of month 3",
kz0dg2e,t1_kz097aw,1c10jfi,"Ofc! Thank you! I don’t see a ton of women do carnivore since it’s always seen as a “manly” diet. I love seing other women’s progress too! It’s great motivation since we loose weight a lot different then men, mine has definitely been in cycles of weight gain and weight loss, you just have to trust the process",
kz0etk9,t1_kz097rl,1c10jfi,"Thank you! Yes and no, I do still have a cup of coffee in the morning with 3 tbsp of heavy cream. I use butter fat for a lot of things because I still don’t fully love a super fatty cut of meat, ribeyes are the fattiest I can go, if I have a leaner cut of meat I usually cook it in about 1 tbsp of butter, melt another tbsp of butter on top, and then eat another tbsp of cold butter on top. I use salt and pepper only for my eggs, but for my steak I use rosemary, oregano, garlic, onion, salt and pepper and cook it in bacon grease. I eat McDonald’s burger patties occasionally if I’m on the run, and I’ve had them with cheese maybe 3 or 4 times which definitely isn’t carnivore friendly but other then that no, I havnt had any cheat meals and been strict the whole time besides the 3 or 4 times of cheese",
kz0mn23,t1_kz0m3ig,1c10jfi,"I’ve definitely noticed that, when I stop loosing weight for periods of time I notice I’m usually more tired and I can tell my body’s trying to heal, when I start loosing more weight I’m usually super active and want to run around a lot more. It’s definitely different than any kind of diet I’ve ever done, this is a lifestyle choice for me now not just a diet, I’ve healed so much internally already and I’m glad it’s showing externally too!",
l019fnn,t1_kzo06xj,1c10jfi,"That’s awesome! Their are so many “carnivore purists” that would absolutely loose their mind hearing you say that, life is meant to be lived and enjoyed :) some people need to stay 1000% strict because of health issues, binging issues, goals etc. but if it works for you then that’s awesome! I personally am trying to detach being reliant on anything for happiness (food as fuel, I’ve now been clean from nicotine for 2 and a half weeks which I’ve been vaping since 6th grade, alcohol, setting a time limit on my phone and reading when I’m bored instead, etc.) so I don’t allow myself any kind of cheats but that’s just because I’m an all in lifestyle change, or a zero effort kind of person",
kz06ojk,t1_kz05i4x,1c10jfi,"Not as much as I should have been, maybe once a week tops, I think I went to the gym maybe 10 times throughout these 3 months. I wanted to give my body a good 2 months or so to totally chill and help reduce all my inflammation, I have IBS and some other inflammatory issues, I started walking twice a day the last month and I’ve been continuing that still (I started this WOE January 1st and havnt had a cheat meal since) I eat about 2k calories roughly when I check but I don’t count calories I just listen to my hunger cues and aim for 80% fat with my calories",
kz0708j,t1_kz064gg,1c10jfi,"I answered to somebody else in more detail but honestly not very much at all, I had a lot of inflammation so I gave myself about 2 months to just chill out and focus 100% on diet, I didn’t have a single cheat meal at any point in these 3 months and I think that’s where a lot of my progress was made!",
kz09b4b,t1_kz06qvz,1c10jfi,"Thank you! I did alt day fasting (36:12) for the first month to get the carbs and oxilates out of my system faster (would not recommend doing that immediately, I felt horrible and had headaches constantly for the first month even with taking electrolytes) but since then no I havnt done anything special. I eat when I’m hungry and don’t eat when I’m not, I don’t track calories but the few times I have checked I eat right around 2k calories, occasionally I’ll have 3k calorie days and the next day I naturally only eat around 1k. I just make sure my food is super fatty, if I feel like I havnt had enough fat throughout the day I snack on a stick of butter, when I checked at the end of the day what I’ve had it always comes out to about 80% cals from fat 20% from protein naturally. I also don’t eat past 8:00 pm and this past month I’ve been waking up 45 minutes early to take my dog on a walk to start the day off. I have 1 tbsp of butter right before my walk and I feel like that’s made a difference in my body burning more fat but I’m not a scientist so idk if the tbsp of butter in the morning trick actually makes a difference",

I did it for both, i started looking into it for weight loss and then started reading about all the crazy health benefits so for my New Year’s resolution I decided I was gonna go 90 days strict no cheats to try it out, the possibility of winning the new years weight loss competition was an extra bonus to stay strict even tho I didn’t win. 
I previously had major IBS and chronic gas cramps to the point I went to the emergency room once because I thought I was having appendicitis, I couldn’t go to the bathroom for days because everything was so blocked up and hurt so bad. I havnt had a single gas cramp, acid reflux, or nausea spell since starting and my ALT liver enzymes are back in range for the first time in years!",

kz0j3j2,t1_kz0e7wl,1c10jfi,I havnt had any cheat days but I’ve also been yoyo dieting for over 10 years now and I think this was the time I finally told myself enough is enough. One thing that’s really helped me is watching videos on not why meat is so good but why vegetables and grains are so bad. For example “Anthony chafees plants are trying to kill you” video. He goes into a little bit of detail on how bad oxilates and other toxins in plants are for you. It’s made me get to the point where I almost get nauseous thinking about eating bread because I know how inflammatory it is for me,

This time I pretty much stayed silent about it until 2 months in when people started asking me what I was doing differently. I realized in the past I wasn’t doing it for me and my body.

As far as inflammation yes and no, my sciatica is 10x better, my chiropractor is mad I don’t see him twice a week anymore haha. I still get minor inflammation in my legs and some muscle soreness if I had a busy day running around but I can feel it getting less and less everyday and it’s nothing compared to how it was months ago",
kz10347,t1_kz0yvop,1c10jfi,"For the first few weeks no, but then I introduced back in to see how I felt and I felt great so I have quit a bit of dairy. I use butter for all my cooking, a few tbsp of heavy cream in the am for my coffee (the only thing I have that’s not carnivore) and I’m not a big cheese person but I do have some occasional Parmesan slices as a snack because the protein to fat ratio is good and Parmesan tends to be a less processed cheese.

kz2i158,t1_kz1gfc1,1c10jfi,"It’s probably because you are going to the gym which is a good thing! Have you considered getting a body scan done that checks your fat-muscle ratio? Carnivore will make you gain a lot more muscle, I gained about 3 pounds of muscle according to my body scan and I wasn’t even consistently going to the gym. I’m 5’6 1/2 and was 199 in my starting pics and now weigh 170. 

What’s your fat- protein ratio? I use my fitness pal occasionally just to double check and make sure I’m eating the correct ratio, you want to aim for 80% fat and 20% protein roughly (but mostly listen to your stools, tmi lol but if they are super firm you need more fat, if they are soft ur good, if they’re super soft like diarrhea you need less, and if they’re watery with bits of of hard you actually need a lot more fat, when they get watery with like ping pong sized balls of hard stool you desperately need more fat.) 

Other then that you may try a fat fast for 2 or 3 days? Just nothing but fat whether that’s from cuts of meat, butter if you do well with it, or just drinking bacon grease, sometimes that’ll jump start things for you.

Carnivore is unlike any diet I’ve ever done, you need to trust your body so your body trusts you, let it do it it’s thing, if you arnt loosing weight you are probably healing from inflammation internally, just give it time and trust the process, I havnt lost any weight this past month but I can tell my clothes are fitting better and most importantly I feel the best I’ve felt this past month and my acne is the clearest it’s been in years! Just give it time for sure! You may look into Kelly hogan on YouTube, she used to be severely obese, she lost some weight but at one point on her journey she gained I believe like 40lbs? She trusted the process and it all came off eventually, it was just her body needing to store all that weight to heal",

I use my pressure cooker quite a bit. If you are ok with cheese I’ve made some yummy pork rind nachos, just take pork rinds (check the ingredients, not all pork rinds are created equal) and put them on a baking sheet, add some cheese and cooked ground beef and bake for like 3 minutes until the cheese is melted.

I lost 12 lbs of water weight in almost a week (I was eating pasta for almost every meal initially) and then I gained 10 back about 3 weeks later, I kept with it and my body slowly started loosing it again, if your body hasn’t been eating the proper human diet prior to this your body may take this opportunity to be like holy shit, we’ve been eating this crappy food for years, let’s store all of this healthy food Incase we go through another spell of eating crappy food again. Your body needs to heal. I’d highly recommend you check out Kelly hogan on YouTube, she was like 300+ lbs if I remember right and she also gained some weight but after a few months she started loosing it again. Carnivore is unlike any other diet you have to trust your body so your body can trust you.

Are you eating about 80% cals from fat 20% cals from protein?",
kz611lt,t1_kz5zvi2,1c10jfi,"Yup same top and bottom! Congratulations!!! And I totally get you, I spend less per day now then I used to since I naturally only eat twice a day a little over half a pound of meat per sitting, and then some heavy cream in my coffee in the morning with some eggs and a little bit of beef jerky or pork rind snacks throughout the day if I’m really needing something else. All in all I spend about $10 a day on food (I live in Oklahoma so food may be cheaper here) which isn’t bad on price compared to what I used to spend at a fast food place, and all the money I save on daily vitimims, and all my medicine I used to have prescribed for gas cramps and ovarian cysts",
kz82dus,t1_kz6pvdu,1c10jfi,"Yogurt OCCASIONALLY, I used to really like yogurt but that was only with all the sugar and such, without it I’m just not a huge fan, if I do get any I recommend a full fat Greek yogurt, Cabot is a really good brand but good luck finding it, it’s always sold out at my Walmart. As far as milk I drank about a cup every week for the first month or so but after that it’s been more spaced out, I havnt had any in probably 20 days? I seem to handle milk really well which I thought beforehand I was intolerant to but it turns out it was all the other junk I was putting in my body. If your gonna have milk I’d recommend you do it before working out, walking, or doing something where you are moving around to help immediately burn off those 10 or so gs of carbs you’ll be getting from it. I go through about 4 tbsp of a butter a day, and I put 6 tbsp of half and half in my coffee and 3 tbsp of heavy cream, I’ve had people tell me that’s too much but I feel great and I’m loosing weight so 🤷🏽‍♀️ hope this helps!",🤷🏽♀
kz8376a,t1_kz6u2ye,1c10jfi,"Thank you! I did alt day fasting 36:12 for the first month to help get all the oxilates and carbs out of my body asap, I wouldn’t necessarily recommend it but it did work, I felt a little off for about a month but I only truly felt sick (headache, brain fog, body aches) for like 3 or 4 days, but I was taking keto chows electrolyte supplement which I’m sure helped. Currently I don’t do any fasting but that’s only because I want my body to try to fully heal from all the stress I’d been putting on it in the past, here in about a month or so I plan on picking back up intermittent fasting but a lot less strict then alt day, more like a 14:10 or 16:8 or something like that",
kzatkez,t1_kz91732,1c10jfi,"Thank you, and it is an awesome diet! I don’t even consider it a diet at this point but just me eating a proper human diet! Totally understand on the not starting cold turkey part too, not only is it a big jump and big commitment to make, but jumping in head first can cause a lot of unwanted symptoms like carb withdrawal and oxilate dumping",
l012a2g,t1_kzkwpj9,1c10jfi,"How long have you been doing it for? What fat % are you at? How many calories are you eating? Are you getting in your electrolytes? I felt dizzy the first two weeks or so and I felt a little light headed occasionally the first month, do you take iodine? I started taking iodine about a month ago since learning about it and I’ve noticed an insane difference in energy and focus",
l0174d5,t1_kzmf7b0,1c10jfi,"So I lost about 12 pounds of just water weight/inflammation like 4 days into it, I’m a recovering vegan lol, and was eating an insanely high carb diet so I lost alot initially. Keep in mind my body is totally different than yours and anybody else’s. A lot of people gain weight or don’t loose much in the beginning because their body is prioritizing healing over weight loss, ur body doesn’t care what you look like in the mirror lol! Have you taken measurements or pictures? I recommend taking measurements with a tailors tape every week or so in the morning after going to the bathroom before eating and put the scale in jail (don’t look at the scale), keep in mind being a women, our cycles are going to drastically affect the scale/measurements as well, holding more/ less water, more/less inflammation, more/less cravings etc.

As for what I eat my usual day is 4 eggs in the A.M. from my friends chickens with about 2 tbsp of butter and 1 tbsp of heavy cream in them for fluffiness, about 3 tbsp of heavy cream and 6 tbsp of half and half, 1 drop of lugols 5% iodine in coffee, 3 or so slices of bacon if I’m hungry occasionally some “fatmans beef jerky” that’s only ingredient is beef (I always eat my heaviest meals in the am)
I usually skip lunch, if I want something to eat I’ll do something simple and light like two hard boiled eggs, lunch meat, beef jerky, or some pork rinds
Around 6:30 I have red meat in some form, whether that’s a rib eye, 70-30 ground beef or some type of fatty stew meat, if I buy a less fatty cut of meat like sirloin I usually cook it in 1 tbsp of butter, add another tbsp of butter on top after it’s done cooking, and then I cut up another tbsp or 2 of butter on the side and eat a little cold with each bite. 

My meals differ every day, sometimes I only eat like 1k calories throughout the day, if I feel like I havnt had enough fat that day I’ll cut a tbsp of two of butter, add some salt and just eat it plain. I also can’t afford to eat steak at every meal like I’d ideally want to, eggs are the cheapest protein source, and butter/heavy cream is the cheapest fat source. You should definitely judge your fat % off of your stools but it’s hard to do that for the first few weeks because it won’t be accurate until your body acclimates. You may try logging your food for the day on my fitness pal, just weigh everything out, log it, and check your fat %, as a women we need more fat then men for optimal hormone production, aim for 80% of calories from fat 20% calories from protein (1 g of fat=9 calories, 1g of protein= 4 calories)",

kzavnnk,t1_kz9nbaw,1c10jfi,"Nope, I own my own dog grooming business and I’ve been doing that for a little over a year now so I am standing 90% of the day but nothing has changed in terms of daily schedule, I went to the gym a handful of times (once a week tops, usually once every other week) throughout the diet but I was also doing that before the diet as well, I started walking in the morning before work the last month but I was already down 25 lbs before this last month so I definitely wouldn’t contribute the bulk of the weight loss to that, I also eat about the same calories a day, I was eating roughly 2k calories a day previously and I now currently eat about 2k calories a day, the only thing that changed is I started eating nothing but eggs, butter, bacon, beef, and heavy cream in my coffee. My diet previously was a very high carb diet, pasta was a staple and when I was hardcore dieting before carnivore trying to be “healthy” I would eat rice, veggies, and a small side of chicken or shrimp.

I’m not saying you shouldn’t exercise btw!^ I just didn’t, I didn’t feel good until this last month, I didn’t have any energy and was just sluggish, I also wanted to let my body fully heal and not add an inflammation, now I’ve finally started to feel the amazing energy boosts and I’ve been walking multiple time a day these past few weeks",

I have found if i try and be strict 100% of the time I will just binge on carbs and thats not good. Proud of you! I am down 28 lbs as of today!,

I find I will nibble at veggies or salad in addition to the meat. Mainly so I don't get questions.... From the host or people I am out with. Which then turns into a big discussion, and everyone has to give me their opinion. I need to do what you do and work on a strategy like eat ahead or something else. I play it low key when I am out.

I will still continue to try and get her on it for 2 weeks just so she can see the great results. I don't push it on her, just suggest it when she says she feels big or bloated. I have gone over all the bad with grains, seed oils and greens with her, I mean she has seen it first hand with my left ankle being cured 2 weeks into strict carnivore. But she doesn't have many issues, she just wants to lose some weight. I guess if she wanted to lose weight bad enough, she would give this a try.",
kz5iak0,t1_kz5hhpb,1c10jfi,"Well I will have 11 years doing keto this May. That's 11 years sugar free. A lot of those were OMAD. Stalled most of those years. Went carnivore to see if I can heal my issues, a few years ago.  Gained white right away, was tired right away even though I was plugging electrolytes. I take magnesium and potassium daily or I am tired... but that's me being weird. 
Like I said above I had to go back to meet heavy keto once I gained 20 LBS. Yes, I said I gained 20 lb on carnivore. 
And yes I have talked to Kelly a little bit, she has said that I need to buy into her program so she could help me... I'm afraid to because I'm afraid I'm going to end up crying in a corner because nothing works but starving myself. I don't want to pay for someone to tell me that.

kzo0aup,t1_kz2cvmw,1c10jfi,Yes it is restrictive but once you find that you feel so much better just eating meat its a no brainer to stick with it.,
kz2clna,t1_kz1lo9e,1c10jfi,"No salt is not enough in the beginning. Electrolytes are mainly made of up sodium, potassium, and magnesium, I’d recommend keto chows liquid electrolyte drops for the first few weeks or just buying the magnesium, and potassium pills and then heavily salting your food, I recommend keto chow because they pull from good sources of vitamins but if you don’t care about that as much I’m sure theirs cheaper ones out there, my bottle lasted me about a month because I did about 3-5 servings a day. After you get past those first few weeks it’s up to you if you take them or not, I still do about once a week because back in the day we as a species where drinking river water and such that had plenty of minerals and stuff in it, now we drink water that’s been boiled multiple times, reverse osmosis, filtered, etc. and we don’t have those same electrolytes/minerals in our water anymore",

kz2dvj7,t1_kz19mib,1c10jfi,"YAY!! Always here if you need any advice or just someone to rant to, it can feel restrictive but it’s nowhere near as restrictive as counting calories and feeling like crap the whole time, just remember to get in your electrolytes those first few weeks! It’s up to you how you want to deal with oxilate dumping, I am a dive head first and get it overwith kind of girl so I opted to just deal with 2 weeks of misery, and about a month of random joint pain and acne flair ups and get over it, but if you start getting aloe of symptoms you may want to take in a small amount of vegetables every day for the first month or so to help with the detox process",

kz086m7,t1_kz074rv,1c10jfi,10x better. I felt worse for the first month but now I feel so much better! It actually gave me mental clarity to quit vaping which I’ve been doing for 8 years now so that helped even more. Overall I just feel more like myself again how I felt years ago. My main thing is I had IBS and I got dibilitating gas cramps 4-5 times a week to the point I had to go to the emergency room once because I thought I had apendcititis. I havnt had 1 since switching,
kz2xhkh,t1_kz25m8f,1c10jfi,"Thank you! And yeah if you handle dairy well it’s for sure a game changer, not many people have issues with butter because of the process it goes through, it removes a lot of the stuff that’s in regular milk that makes people sick, I got through minimum 4 tbsp a day but I’ve had days where I’ve gone through more then a stick.

kzap4zr,t1_kz845km,1c10jfi,"Yeah she may come around to it, definitely don’t push it to much, I can be super stubborn and when I complained to my boyfriend for over a year straight about wanting to loose weight and that I “couldn’t do it” he gave me a million different suggestions and every time he suggested something I didn’t want to do it. I don’t know why because he’s super strong and trustworthy when it comes to weight loss advice, I mean he squats 650 lbs😂 so he knows what he’s talking about, but something about advice on your body and insecurities coming from your partner often triggers some weird response where you don’t want to do it and turn it into an argument. it’s the same way with almost everyone I know, it’s the reason you usually hear people say they can’t work out with their girlfriend because they end up getting into a fight every time. I would just continue to lead by example and nonchalantly bring up things like “wow look at this transformation this person did on carnivore” and things like that. Would she be willing to try keto? On keto you can still have veggies and small quantities of fruit if that’s what she’s concerned about, keto is the gateway into carnivore lol, I don’t know hardly anyone who’s been keto for more then a few years and hasn’t at least tried carnivore. Also if she’s going to try it I recommend doing at least a month, if she has been eating a high carb diet before starting she is going to feel like crap the first two weeks as she detoxes and I’d hate for her to get turned off the diet based off that initial week or two.",😂
kz5upmd,t1_kz5iak0,1c10jfi,"I know you said you’ve tried every tweak but have you gotten blood work done? Checked your iodine levels, b12 levels, and thyroid? or tried taking iodine or eating more seafood for minimum 6 weeks consistently to see if that makes a difference? What about eating in a surplus to try and get your metabolism to adjust? You said you where eating omad for most of that which I’m not going to say is unhealthy, I think fasting can be amazing for your body, but it can also cause stalls in weight loss after time, your body starts to think you are in a famine and wants to hold on to the weight. My boyfriend started eating 3k calories everyday (before he started working out) and he gained weight at first but eventually his body adjusted and then if he started eating anything less then 3k he would loose weight. It’s totally normal to feel like crap the first two weeks- a month, how long have you stuck to just straight carnivore? It could be due to oxilate dumping since you said you’re keto which makes me assume you eat a lot of vegetables since they’re one of the only low carb foods besides meat, oxilate dumping will make you feel like shit and you’ll sometimes gain water weight due to inflammation, there are weighs to help avoid some of the symptoms like having small amounts of vegetables as you transition. Again I’m not saying this is the case with you, I’m never going to tell somebody one diet fits all, I think it works wonders for 90% of the population but not everyone, I only get frustrated when people tell me my diets stupid and arnt even willing to try it but if they try it and don’t like it then that’s totally fine. The only other thing I can think is have you tried getting a body scan done? Maybe get one done and then check again in a few weeks and see if you are actually gaining fat weight or if you happen to be gaining muscle? I would recommend maybe getting a glucose monitor and seing what your fasted glucose usually sits like consistently because I’ve never heard of anyone saying keto works but carnivore doesn’t. My only other suggestion is try carnivore with about 25 g worth of carbs from fruit, no veggies, opt for berries as they’re usually the closest to their natural version",

Haven't eaten a ""lot of veg"" in years, I have been low oxalate for a long time. 
Yes I have tried eating more. That's where the 20 lb came from. 
And I didn't say the keto worked for me either. That's why I was trying to go carnivore. I lost 20 lb originally on keto and gained it all back, plus now. 
I'm not adding carbs because I am pre-diabetic and would become full diabetic.",
kz5ecdt,t1_kz5dt7y,1c10jfi,"Yes it’s totally normal, make sure you are getting in a lot of fat and getting your electrolytes in, I would give yourself a couple weeks to just let your body relax and heal as much as it can. “Steak and butter girl” on YouTube has some videos on her experience when she first switched and how horrible she felt in the beginning, I had constant headache, mild body aches, and brain fogginess that started around 10 days in and last till about day 20, then they completely went away and I started feeling amazing, I was also keto for a couple weeks before started carnivore so my transition was smoother then it would’ve been if I would’ve jumped straight in",
kz5eh3t,t1_kz5dt7y,1c10jfi,There’s a thread on here that’s specifically for people who have been doing carnivore for less then like 2 months and their may be some answers tk your questions on there,
kz0hlgb,t1_kz092h7,1c10jfi,"Definitely stick with it, it gets easier and you feel a lot better after those first 30-60 days of adjusting. I recently incorporated iodine into my daily routine because I live in the middle of the US nowhere near the sea and I can tell that made a big difference as well",
kz0oym7,t1_kz0moml,1c10jfi,"Yeah it was pretty horrible, my stomach would be completely concaved in one spot and bloated about 8” out in another, I’m not kidding I looked like I was pregnant and you could see the outline of the child and super painful. I got those about 5 times a week and could never figure out what foods where causing it, the one that sent me to the ER tho was when I was on vacation my cramping started really bad, at first I thought it was just period cramps and then it got really bad, I got to the point where I couldn’t walk without being picked up and I tried to go to the bathroom and tmi but I physically couldn’t push, it felt like I was trying to give birth, lasted like 3 hours before I went to the er because my family thought I had a hernia or something, turned out it was trapped gas and ovarian cysts that where also caused by my diet because of the hormonal imbalance",
kz0c355,t1_kz07rv5,1c10jfi,"100% the one thing that’s helped me the most is switching things up. There’s a beef jerky emporium by me that makes fresh jerky, I told him I do carnivore and cant have any form of sugar/dextrose or vegetable fats and he makes me some exotic meats with just s&p. I’ve had some nice kangaroo, alligator, venison, duck, etc. the other thing that’s helped me for changing it up from steaks and ground beef is chicken thighs and adding other sources of fat to it. For example bacon rapped chicken thighs, or my favorite is chicken cut into little cubes, cook it on the skillet and let it literally soak in butter almost like shrimp scampi. You just gotta change it up as much as you can! I recently made some pork rind nachos, and I also discovered using eggs are a “tortilla” and putting ground beef and cheese inside and it was delicious",
kzeuy47,t1_kzc6qfi,1c10jfi,"Thank you and you as well! For me at the end of the day if someone is going to stop being friends with me or heavily judge me or not invite me to events because of what I eat? Then they sent true friends and don’t really care about me. It’s one thing if I started being annoying and shoving it down peoples throats but I only talk about it when people ask, I’ve brought it up myself to two people in my life and that’s my dad because he freaks out about his cholesterol, and my boyfriend because he has pre diabetes, other then that I only talk about it if they start asking questions",

That’s how I feel with my boyfriend, he insists he’s healthy because he’s physically fit, but when he gets his blood work done he’s pre diabetic, has thyroid issues, and he used to have low test until he got his prescription for it, I just want him to be healthy so we can have a long life together, he always jokes he’s gonna die by 40 and I’m like I get it’s a joke but also please start actually taking care of your health😅😓 he eats around 400 grams of carbs a day and when I told him he needs to start considering low carb because he’s pre diabetic he insisted it’s because he doesn’t have enough carbs?? Diet and exercise is the only thing in our relationship we can’t have a conversation about because we are both very head strong but for two opposite reasons, he just cares about maxing his lifts and looks and I care about maxing my health and living to 100 years old",😅😓
kz60262,t1_kz5z8bk,1c10jfi,"Oh dang I’m sorry I misread that, totally understandable about going to the dr, if you wanted to check your blood work out without going to a doctor you can order blood work online without a doctor through independent blood work places, for example “Any lab test now” is one of them, you choose what you wanna check for, if you end up having an issue often times there is some natural remedy for conditions so you don’t have to deal with a doctor, you may find out you have some type of disease/disorder that needs to get taken care of first in order for your body to feel comfortable enough to loose fat",
kz5f74x,t1_kz5ecdt,1c10jfi,"Thank you!! I needed this motivation lol. With all the ”keto flu” symptoms it can be hard to keep going and remember why you started. I can be impatient.

Anyway! You look great! Will try to find that thread :)",
kz0hvjk,t1_kz0hlgb,1c10jfi,"Yea, I’m definitely gonna stick with it… I was juicing for 60 days prior to starting juicing… I went from 380 to 284, weight is staying around 286, definitely looking forward to seeing where I am a month or two from now with this diet, like this much more than juicing. I like food😂",😂
kz0w1fr,t1_kz0oym7,1c10jfi,"Omg, so it was trapped gas!

Wild. That shit hurts so fkn BAD. Can't breathe, ripping and tearing, shifting guts, moving abdomen.

So terrifying.",
kz0cvkp,t1_kz0c355,1c10jfi,Okay now I’m hungry,
kz1gy1a,t1_kz0c355,1c10jfi,"Hi, love your enthusiasm for Carnivore. Which tortilla recipe do you use?",
kzgomrv,t1_kzeuy47,1c10jfi,"Alot of people claim that their diabetes was cured by the diet. Due to the hidden sugars in so many processed foods. The straight meat having none of that. May work in your b/f s favour. 
Hopefully he can watch your journey and it may help him if the claims are true. 
I agree with you, if people are going to judge you based on your choices, they aren't true friends. Take care.",
kz60m9i,t1_kz60262,1c10jfi,"I'll have to check that out, I didn't know you could do that. 
I can't imagine I would have anything, my family is just thicker, we're just carb  intolerant, I always thought.",
kz5gtwi,t1_kz5f74x,1c10jfi,"Of course! I’ll look too and see if I can find it, definitely just trust the process, your symptoms definitely sound like an electrolyte issue which is the root cause of “keto flu” 99% of the time. when you loose water you loose electrolytes with it, it can take a long time for your body to build back up those electrolyte stores that you lost and that’s where you feel like crap for days or weeks at a time, consistently take electrolytes for the next few days and I can almost guarantee you’ll feel better by Monday. You may add a little bit of a seafood as one of your meals and see if it could be an iodine issue if you arnt using iodized salt. Depending on where you live (near the coastline or not) your soil might not be very iodine rich, the only supplement I take is iodine because I’m not a huge seafood fan and I live in a land locked state",
kz0jmnb,t1_kz0hvjk,1c10jfi,"Oh for sure! My dad started doing juice fasts right as I started doing carnivore. It’s funny when we see each other at family events the difference between us, he’s pretty sluggish for the most part and I’m bouncing off the walls. When he’s done with his juice he pats his belly and says he’s full, within an hour he wants to take a nap, when I’m done eating I wanna go run a marathon and I’m fueled for hours😂",😂
kz0zgxe,t1_kz0w1fr,1c10jfi,"Yeah it’s atrocious, there’s different levels to it, sometimes it would just be a little bit of an inconvenience, almost like when your side hurts a little bit after jogging and you get a “side stitch” like nothing unbearable but not fun, but it could get bad enough that if I was eating out with friends I would have to leave half way through because I couldn’t sit down at a table anymore and it would bring me to tears.",
kz0zm3c,t1_kz0w1fr,1c10jfi,"Definitely still get it checked out if that’s an issue you have had happen multiple times tho! Those symptoms you said could be and sound like gas but it could also be something else, better safe than sorry!",
kz0jswl,t1_kz0cvkp,1c10jfi,Go eat!!😂😂,😂😂
kz2g088,t1_kz1gy1a,1c10jfi,"Thank you! I wouldn’t really call them tortillas but more like an omelette without all the vegetables and stuff, if I want it to be egg heavy I just use whole eggs and beat them really well, but if I want a thin wrap that’s closer to a toratilla I use just egg whites, if you just use egg whites tho definitely make sure you cook in bacon grease and have some other forms of higher fat throughout the day!",
kz2g8ny,t1_kz1gy1a,1c10jfi,"If you are ok with being about 99.9% carnivore, they sell these egg white wraps at big grocery stores, they’re usually in he fridge section by the eggs and bacon, the unflavored ones are 100% carnivore besides xanthen gum but their a super good toratilla replacement, I just stopped buying anything premade for the time being because I wanted to go 90 days super super strict to get the full benefits",
kzgzxbs,t1_kzgomrv,1c10jfi,"Yup, on top of that any kind of sugar or carbs spike your insulin, you develop insulin resistance when your insulin is constantly being spiked so giving your body very little sugar will keep you from developing diabetes or even reversing it if you have it",
kz61r2v,t1_kz60m9i,1c10jfi,"Trust me I get it, my cousin is 13 and weighs 40 lbs more than me, my aunts over 300 and she’s about 5’3, my uncle is about 280, everyone else in my family on my dads side is minimum 60 lbs overweight besides my dad and my grandma and that’s only because they starve themself and workout for over two hours a day (my dads a firefighter). I’m not gonna say I was like MASSIVE before but I definitely wasn’t skinny and I’ve been like that my whole life. It never hurts to get things checked out, worst case you find out you are perfectly healthy and you spent money for no reason, but the last thing you’d want to do is keep beating yourself up over things and come to find out it’s not even your fault 🤷🏽‍♀️",🤷🏽♀
kz71ui2,t1_kz5gtwi,1c10jfi,"Oh got you! Thank you for this help! I am kinda of craving some seafood. Sorry for all the questions.
Do you have a specific iodine supplement you recommend?",
kz0o82t,t1_kz0jmnb,1c10jfi,I never had any energy issues when I was juicing.. always felt good.. but it hits people different,
kzbphau,t1_kz2g8ny,1c10jfi,"I'll see what I can find, thanks!",
kzh5ycn,t1_kzgzxbs,1c10jfi,"Yes that's what people have been saying. That carnivore has reverted their systems back to normal. 
Something the medical system knows well about. And I would not be surprised if they were keeping that to themselves. 
To many parts of the economic strength or growth benefit from keeping people like this. We have cancer and obesity running rampant. All things no one wants to fix, because so many companies and industries would lose massive amounts of money. Possibly tipping the whole US or other countries economies over. 
I think it's all about the mighty dollar. And if some people find a way that works for them. They are marginalized and called extremists or something. Instead of just looking at the results.",
kz657a7,t1_kz61r2v,1c10jfi,"Yeah I don't have any symptoms, the only thing I have is menopause 😁",😁
kz7znba,t1_kz71ui2,1c10jfi,"I use 1 drop (NOT DROPPER FULL JUST A SINGLE DROP) of j.crows lugols solution 5% but you can also you 1-2 drops of the 2% I highly recommend you check out [this](https://youtu.be/0N6wiJ2Oxck?si=T43JxO9cRqdgg5gE) video, it’s only 14 minutes long, it doesn’t go into crazy detail but it can give you a good introduction so you arnt going in blind and can make your own decisions! You can also just increase your seafood and eggs (just make sure and get the free range eggs, you’ll know if they’re good quality by the deep yellow almost orange yolk, the cheap eggs have a very light yellow yolk and don’t have half the amount of vitimims and minerals you would get in a healthy egg)",

l010ip3,t1_kzh5ycn,1c10jfi,"1000% couldn’t agree more, I tell everyone I know to just try it for 2-3 months, I promise you won’t keel over and have a heart attack, just give it a shot and if you hate it you can always go back, it just sucks so many people are terrified to even try it because of all the superstitions behind it :/",
kz80s4u,t1_kz657a7,1c10jfi,"Menopause is no joke, have you gained more weight since you started going through it? Idk how against medicine you are but I’ve heard quite a bit of women find great success with supplementing progesterone and estrogen?",

l02kwy8,t1_l010ip3,1c10jfi,"Yeah ppl have been indoctrinated into believing that carnivore is just one steak away from blocked arteries and a heart attack.

kz81974,t1_kz80s4u,1c10jfi,"I've always been thick, I don't think I've gained more weight because of it, I'm on the other side, I took plant estrogen and that was enough for me, helped me a lot.",
kz80e7t,t1_kz7zt2l,1c10jfi,"Of course! I’m not a doctor so don’t take what I say blindly, do your own research for sure, all I can say is my own personal experience with it and I feel 10x better then I did a month and a half ago, it took about a month to notice the difference, I never measured my iodine before so I’m not sure if I was deficient but I can assume because I’ve actually had the energy to walk a 3-4 miles every day, I’ve been waking up an hour earlier, and my weight loss has started to pick back up again, it could be  coincidence but I don’t think so🤷🏽‍♀️",🤷🏽♀
kzami97,t1_kz81974,1c10jfi,Well that’s good! My aunt used progesterone cream from yams or something and she said it helped her loose weight and she feels amazing,
kz82z9i,t1_kz80e7t,1c10jfi,"Woww! Those are some amazing news. I just watched the video and it was very informative. Thank you for that. It truly is a shame doctors aren’t taught to inform patients about this. Maybe this is a dumb question, but do you ingest the iodine or put it on your skin? 🙈",🙈
kz84n1q,t1_kz82z9i,1c10jfi,"I ingest it, however if you are fine with a yellow dot on your skin for a day, you can put it on your skin, your body will only absorb as much as it wants to! And yeah I definitely recommend you check out some of his videos, he probably has 2-3 videos on any question you could ever have about the diet or your symptoms etc. he’s a great resource to have if people on here can’t answer a question or you’d just rather hear it from a doctors mouth!",
kz85oke,t1_kz84n1q,1c10jfi,"Yes! Dr Berry is great! I used him, Mikhaila Peterson, Steak and Butter Gal and Dr Chaffee when first gaining interest for this diet. Thank God for these people honestly. And thank you for helping me like this!

One last question, only the 5% of J Crows Lugol’s solution is available in my country. [This one specifically](https://www.amazon.co.uk/Potassium-Non-Radioactive-Pharmaceutical-Supplement-Antibacterial/dp/B001PN3BUW/ref=mp_s_a_1_1?crid=27K8K8SB08ZLL&dib=eyJ2IjoiMSJ9.1x4bKu0olli3Wt5hXFB01GHpF2O_ap8t6O-zHR1WD0EjRey5NpYeQPubfe2rrxU_8SuWOBnFq7eJFFZVmbz0lUEI5ALfilppTxC_gpNPDLjMmnzvyJPsQCo8zKRItiWWBDG4NpBQgTZWrVP2WODNW0DzYaYJffKeZNAOKU9qZ6Su6MUIL37Ijnk5KaUa8liUSFsXbCxIv96WdCTyNssA2g.uavrYdZ2nyi8JXQBu06bgvBwwhtbQRqwTYSP3_nlArk&dib_tag=se&keywords=iodine+j+crow&qid=1712925867&sprefix=iodine+j+crow%2Caps%2C252&sr=8-1). (It’s 5% iodine and 10% potassium)

Do you think this will do compared to the 2% I assume you use? Or do you think there might any problems, is the potassium good etc?",
kzasob0,t1_kz85oke,1c10jfi,"that’s exactly the one I use! I put one drop in my coffee every morning since I still drink coffee with heavy cream every morning, you can also do it with water if you don’t drink coffee. If you want to dilute it just add one drop to a water bottle (again one single drop, not dropper full) shake really well and just drink half of it instead of the full thing and that’ll put you at about 3.16 mg of iodine a day! Also you can try ordering directly from j crows [website](https://www.jcrowsllc.com) and see if they deliver in your country",
kzcbpaj,t1_kzasob0,1c10jfi,Thank you! I ordered it! Excited to try! :’),
kzewede,t1_kzcbpaj,1c10jfi,"I hope it helps!! Like I said I notified an insane difference, I actually just learned today that fluoride in our water affects our body’s ability to absorb iodine as well which is why we need more of it!",
kzfkhry,t1_kzewede,1c10jfi,"Oh woww! So many things to be mindful of. I wonder if a good filter can help counter the fluoride as well?

Either way I am excited to see what difference the iodine will make.",
kzftj54,t1_kzfkhry,1c10jfi,Yeah I’m not sure? I know people who drink a ton of tea definitely need more because a lot tea is grown in very floride rich soil,

3-4K steps a day, I lost 300 Gram of weight in a week.

lrmjltf,t1_lrmj2l5,1g263e2,Absolutely!  Thanks so much! I also had the heart palpitations in the beginning. I think it has to do more with the frequent urination flushing out your system which rapidly decreases electrolytes during the ‘adjustment’ period but as long as you’re eating correctly moving forward knowing what you need to accomplish you should be fine without additional supplements.

My mental state which has always been borderline depressed but never medicated is absolutely gone! 

My sleep has improved drastically. 

My lower back pain is non existent. Possible that it’s from the weight loss or inflammation reduction or a combo of both. 

My sex drive is unstoppable which my wife has obviously noticed. My erections now last like ten whole minutes after intercourse which was never the case before.  I would lose it the moment I was finished. 

All really good things!",

lrmi4sp,t1_lrmh3iw,1g263e2,"Yeah I’ve been getting about 1500-2000 potassium from for a day. I take a multi vitamin to help supplement the rest. I think because I use salted butter in every meal I haven’t had the need for additional electrolytes especially considering beef chicken and pork also contain electrolytes. 

Sometimes I think some people go overboard trying to supplement electrolytes not knowing how much is actually naturally occurring in the food we eat already.",

lrlwduh,t1_lrlvy4l,1g263e2,Yeah that’s actually a great question.  In the beginning I was always super hungry.  Then after like two weeks I noticed no matter how big or small the meals after five minutes of eating I felt full. So I went from eating maybe 3 meals a day plus snack all over to only eating breakfast and dinner.  Most days I have to force myself to eat dinner because I really am not that hungry anymore……ever…..very strange to literally never feel hunger like I used to on carb heavy diet.,

lrpj6jj,t1_lrpiu7n,1g263e2,Carnivore will eventually dump trigs. With the weight loss and healthy insulin levels that will follow I would only assume it would help fatty liver disease. Is it alcohol related fatty liver? Surprisingly that’s the easiest one to treat and fully reverse.,
lrme9jg,t1_lrmdwhh,1g263e2,Yea the piss was real for sure but can’t forget about the absolute cleansing that happens in other ways too hahaha. I think I shit 15 pound of liquid while my gut fixed itself for like a week. They weren’t kidding when they said to be prepared for that part,
lrpej6v,t1_lrpdutu,1g263e2,"From a weight control perspective (not any other chronic disease or inflammation) this is why I think carnivore works. 

1. No carbs means no blood sugar spikes 
2. No blood sugar spikes and crashes - no hunger 
3. No crazy levels of hunger - no binge eating or caving for crap quality food dense in calories 
4. No carbs means- burn fat for fuel 
5. Low levels of hunger - easier to maintain a calorie deficit every day 
6. Calorie deficit every day equals weight loss 

Many people on this diet go overboard…. Half a stick of butter raw. Half a stick cooked in the three steaks they eat in one sitting. More butter with the 10 eggs they put on one plate. 

All this equals incredible levels of calories that some aren’t burning off. This will make you gain weight or at the best stay the same. 

2 meals a day at 1k calories each is what’s worked for me 

So have the steak but not three. Have the eggs but not 10. Have the butter but a tablespoon with each meal…etc. 

That’s what’s worked for me!",

lrpk6kq,t1_lrpjw25,1g263e2,There is tons of misinformation of trigs.  Trigs is literally excess calories that aren’t being burned being stored in the form of trigs.  So yes shitty food is the easiest path to high trigs.,
lrpfcla,t1_lrpf2ga,1g263e2,Yes but don’t go lean in a fat sense. Just go leaner on calories. Fat is more important in this ratio than protein.,
lrpkmhj,t1_lrpk6kq,1g263e2,"Thanks! I hear that too…my trigs likely from empty carbs from too much food ( double problem ) and empty carbs from beer. I don’t drink that much, fatty liver likely from the weight gain.

Heart palpitations part concerns me, that is solved with electrolytes? Do we lose electrolytes only eating carnivore?",
lrpnmxo,t1_lrpkmhj,1g263e2,Also just wanted to mention how inactivity is a HUGE contributor to high trigs.  Even if you eat healthy but don’t exercise literally at all like you have the calories only have one place to go. Fat and trigs.  Simply walking everyday will lower trigs ASAP. When doing physical exercise your body uses the trigs in blood for energy.,
lrpmvzo,t1_lrpkmhj,1g263e2,"The electrolyte issue is solved by 
A - consuming enough minerals like sodium and potassium via food choices 
B- supplementing through supplements

I personally have done blood work while on this diet and all those were in the higher levels of normal range just by eating good and cooking with salt and butter.  We often forget how much electrolytes are naturally occurring in the food we eat. Even drinking tap water will help up your electrolytes.

The palpitations that happen aren’t dangerous and simply your body adjusting. Your electrolyte levels would have to be pretty severely low to cause injury.",
lrppwjc,t1_lrpnmxo,1g263e2,"I want to try this so badly. Being 120 overweight, high BP and pulse, difficulty moving about to get steps in concerned me. But need to do something.

lrpphv4,t1_lrpmvzo,1g263e2,"A lot of potassium in meats? Before the 120 lb gain, I could jog two miles at 49 years old - 2 years ago. Now, taking the garbage out can leave me a bit winded. You have the same when overweight? I’m carrying about double what you were tho.",
lrpv05b,t1_lrppwjc,1g263e2,"I’m 5’10

The highest I ever was was 260 pounds when I was 18.  I did keto then and went down to 145 but I was scary skinny.  I then got a remote job had kids and it all went down hill. Climbed back to 230. Then tried calorie cutting which was hard having carbs but got down to 209.  Then committed to this to get to 165-170 and now sit at 169 two months later.  The improvements to my energy, movement, cardiac health has been incredible. 

Start with small activities.  Walk around the block once a day.  Then the next week do it twice. Then the next week three times.  Then the next week 4 times.  Before you know it you’ll start adjusting even with the extra weight to start tackling like 5-10k steps a day.  It won’t ever be easy but it gradually gets easier I can promise you that.

I was very out of shape. Easily winded from anything at all. 

My resting heart rate was 100. It’s now 60. 

The healthier you eat and the more you move the better shape you will be in and it all trickles down. 

I had crippling lower back pain from a slightly shorter right leg than left.  On this diet and the weight loss that pain is completely gone.  Not just like 50% better.  100% GONE.

lrpvgce,t1_lrpu7u4,1g263e2,"I’m also 34.  Even a fat out of shape 34 year old will be able to push through some walks you might not be able to do at 49. 

Going sedentary for two years at 34 will be different than at 49.  That’s about the same time frame I was sedentary working from home.

lrpwlek,t1_lrpvjx1,1g263e2,"The fatter you are the harder your heart has to pump leading to Bp and high bpm. Drop weight and those numbers drop. 

If I were you I would start keto first.  It makes it easier to convert to carnivore or maybe you’ll love keto and stick with it! 

Going keto will allow you to not be so nervous about what you’re eating or if you are having too much.  

Keto is high fat mixed with moderate protein but no carbs no sugar. You can have veggies though just not starchy ones like potatoes. This allowance will offer all the vitamins and minerals you need without needing to be concerned about shorting yourself.  Then once you drop the weight and are more educated switch to carnivore if you like.",
lrpw2e1,t1_lrpvgce,1g263e2,"That was my routine as well. I’m 51 now, weight started coming on at 49. Winded easily like you were. Suppose I need to just get as many steps in as possible. 

I do wonder, if cut down to 2000 calories, low carb, intermittent fasting…some would think still would lose weight.",
lrpwu9o,t1_lrpw2e1,1g263e2,"But even at 2k calories, low carbs, there seems to be some kind of accelerated effect from carnivore. As in lose weight faster. Can’t deny that. 

I thought the idea was to get the body to burn its stored fat when overweight, so when adding fat - isn’t that the fat we burn first? How does adding fat help us lose the fat we have? It’s fascinating",
lrpxi28,t1_lrpw2e1,1g263e2,"Weight loss is a very direct equation to solve.  There is only one equation not multiple.  Calories in Vs calories burned. If you eat 2k calories a day but your total burn including just existing is 2k then you won’t lose a pound.  If you eat 2k but burn 3k you will start dropping the weight. 

Being as overweight as you are and lacking the activity component you need to be on a very restricted calorie deficit diet.  I’m taking a wild shot in the dark here but if I were you I would only be eating 1k calories a day. Your body has more than enough stored energy to survive with no issues on 1k calories a day.  If you start exercising more than you would need to up the calories. 

I would try researching this and hearing from other dietician’s that specialize in this kind of diet to guide you. Don’t just do what I say.  I’m just saying what I would do if I were you.",
lrpyfcq,t1_lrpwu9o,1g263e2,"Adding fat to the fat burning machine helps the machine burn harder in turn burning more fat.  It also just turns the switch on for this mechanism.

How do you keep this switch on? Continue eliminating the carbs and sugar and feed the fat the starts the flame.  The flame will then grow based on your fat stores. 

This diet also simply helps cravings and hunger resulting in balanced insulin levels which eliminate a lot of the relapse potential contributing to a continued healthy diet. It is complex but at the same time not really.",
lrpztof,t1_lrpxi28,1g263e2,"You totally make sense. I’ve talked to dieticians, tried Mediterranean, intermittent fasting. So many people have so many ideas, for so many different body types / metabolisms - it gets to be too much.

I am liking the idea of carnivore for the simplicity of it. And, because I know carbs and no activity is what out on my weight, also got stores as sugar and gave fatty liver and high trigs. 

I’m going to do it. When I have a protein shake, low carb yogurt, avocado smoothie. Eat a pile of preservative free turkey at lunch and an egg. Then have bone broth soup at night with meat and spinach / romaine. I was losing a pound a day. 

That was about 1200 cals tops. Just got stressed / depressed working remote and caring for parent…that a DoorDash binge and couple of beers was the only comfort. I have to add fiber powder to my water to have solid BM’s, because of diverticulosis. But that won’t be a problem. 

I’d say that regiment above was around 30 grams of carb a day. Well below 50 level for Keto. 

I could trim those carbs down a bit, maybe lose more. Right when the weight was coming in, and the 2 mile walk jogs were ending…I was completely exhausted the whole day after 2 miles and some light weight work. I imagine cortisol from stress was playing a role. Thanks so much once again for your time man, really.",

Not having a gall bladder, it’s a bit tougher to break down fats. But I see  the fat burner gets ignited by introducing new fats that gets the machine going, then body looks for more fats from the stored fat.",
lrq5386,t1_lrq4bhd,1g263e2,"It’s not the introduction of fats that makes the fat burning mechanism turn on in the human body.  It’s the absence of carbs and sugar that turn it on.  So theoretically you can eliminate carbs and sugar and still enter ketogenic state. This will cause your body to feed off more of your fat stores.  Also just overall reduction in calories will lead to the body attacking fat stores.  

Look at it this way.  If you started keto or carnivore today (high fat requirements) but still ended the days in calorie deficit your body will use the fat you eat as energy and the caloric deficit will also burn store fat.  This process might take a little longer to lose the weight. 

You could go another option and eliminate carbs and sugar and not go high on fat intake and your body will just feed off more of your stored fat.  Likely resulting in quicker weight drop but both options need calorie deficit.",
lrq62dm,t1_lrq5386,1g263e2,"Ah, so the body relies more on added fat for energy once at maintenance maybe.

When extremely overweight, can cut carbs sugar and body will consume stored excess fat. I have enlightened stored, cut cut the carbs sugar and let the body eat my fat already there. 

Did you start off adding butter and what not? Or just rely on your stored fats until they were mostly gone, then added butter rather than carbs for energy.",

 It if I can’t get to that kinda deficit from walking right away, until I build that up- then gotta get the extra deficit from extreme calorie restriction like you were saying. 

I think hard keto, walk what I can walk. Get over the keto flu hump ( never could before ) and see how that goes…drop a pound a day. When that tapers off, can increase steps and fat. Thanks!",

m59d0wf,t1_m595lpu,1hsk5it,Are you working out alongside? I’m Day 2 and wondering if my 8k steps daily will do or if I need to do some real sport.,
m5bweur,t1_m595lpu,1hsk5it,"No labs done before or since. It's impossible to get a doctor here without going to the ER, and we need doctor referral for labs. 

What I can say is that a year ago, I could barely take a flight of stairs without sucking air, my heart pounding...or I would get hangry the moment I felt a little hungry...and now I run up stairs, hike up hills and only ever just feel hungry without the obvious blood sugar drops. 

14lbs in 2 weeks is about right, all water weight. I'll be honest, the first 3 months were very challenging and scary at times because of all the oxalate dumping you'll go through, adjusting to the amount of fat you're eating and dealing with external pressures. Stick it out, get some good electrolytes and take it easy while you transition. One thing I reminded myself of in the early days was how concerned was I with my nutrition or labs before I tried carnivore? None. Zero. And I was eating extreme SAD. 

Hopefully that's helpful.",
m5bwwmw,t1_m59drcq,1hsk5it,"Just ate freely, until I felt full. I tried eating windows but sometimes I was just too hungry and cook another steak. On average, I'm still eating 2500 calories a day but it's just beef, eggs and butter typically. I have chicken and salmon occasionally for a change.

The biggest struggle is socializing / pressure from others, and being prepared if you have to be away from home often - either meal prep and bring with you or figure out go to spots out and about. More immediately in the first 3 months, I did have a lot of issues with having to use the washroom frequently with what I assume was oxalate dumping issues.

Good luck to you",
m5bx2f6,t1_m5a3ld8,1hsk5it,"Thanks, will do.",
m5bx5y9,t1_m5ax1jc,1hsk5it,"Thanks! I sometimes struggle to 'see' the change in the mirror but these comparison photos help and all the positive feedback here has been amazing.

m5bx8em,t1_m5budfm,1hsk5it,Thanks! I feel like I gained years back on my life and notice now 'healthy' benefits everyday :),
m5hn92b,t1_m5cbf7e,1hsk5it,"Thanks, I'll aim for this!",
m5hmxq7,t1_m5d8cgy,1hsk5it,"Generous amounts of good salt is my recommendation. Eating good cuts of meat can be very tasty with just salt or no salt. Fall in love with eating a steak for breakfast, or lunch or just whenever you're hungry. Salt up your ground beef. If you don't have an issue with cheese, use good quality cheese. 

A lot of the struggle at the beginning is transitioning off sugar and carbs. You may have days where you're absolutely miserable...you have to will your way through these moments and know it gets better. I went through this for close to 3 months but just remained committed.

Good luck",

ldz2cm1,t3_1e71a7c,1e71a7c,"Congrats. I understand that psychology, that place where you're going downhill and know it but at some level want it because you think that's where you should be.


I was being crushed by work/family/finance pressure a few years ago, and kind of accepted where I was going. Thankfully my knee pain and gout woke me up, motivated me to stick to zero alcohol and carnivore.


The first month was between two jobs - great time to change my habits. Like you, so happy I stuck to it, and my attitude has shifted: if I can do one thing against the crap life throws at me, it's to look after myself to be the best version to tackle things.


Congrats again!!",

All of them are incredibly beneficial and healing.. especially! > carnivore and IF.  

Your personal lifestyle journey is very admirable and inspiring.  Especially being literally addicted to fake, poisonous “food”  We’ve all been there.  And that’s why we’re all here now - on the other side.

When i go meat shopping, i cut, marinate, bag everything, make the ground beef into patties, meatballs etc and freeze. It’s REALLY not that hard to toss them in the airfryer, on the grill, under the broiler etc. 
Sometimes i boil a bunch of eggs (I love boiled eggs, especially when they’re then seasoned and fried in tallow) or cook sausages/brats and bacon. This is just to have snacks on hand should I need it. I also always have frozen cultured (Amish) butter slices in the freezer. Or cottage cheese. All of these, sparingly. And yes, broth.

m6amn6g,t3_1hxnha7,1hxnha7,I like that people are trying to take health into their own hands but the amount of carbs I see on this sub is actually disgusting. This isn’t r/carbivore nor is it r/animalbased nor is it r/keto. I’m not going to apologize either for sounding strict. Carnivore is a very specific way of eating that doesn’t involve any carbs or plants or fruits.

m76lpse,t1_m6lik7t,1hxnha7,You basically proved me right at the end. lol An animalbased keto would be just keto since the whole thing about keto is being low carbs so they'll just eat fruit that have low carbs or portion control the amount of fruit they eat.,

If you understand how animal based works and how keto works you know the difference is huge. Animal based eats a lot of fruit as a part of their meal (a side dish in almost every meal), keto has a small handful of berries once in a while (like a dessert). You can say fruit is fruit and eating it is eating it, but there is a huge difference… and yes I am chill, even if it doesn’t come off in text. :)",

You beating around the bush at this point with your leading sentences is cowardly. Either shit or get off the pot. 
Your explanations about both is something I already considered hence why I brought in carbs. The major factor of keto from my research is the net carbs per day, regardless of the type of food you eat. That's the reason I said animalbased keto is just keto as under that detail it would be with the specificity of eating fruit instead of something like rice or avocado. If one were to be carnivore with a bit of fruit and kept it under 25g of carbs per day, that'd be animalbased keto... or simply keto. Hell, depending on who you ask, that'd still be carnivore as that officially that term is 75+% meat+fat diet.",

You can cut it into roasts, steals or grind it into ground beef. Also, you can get pasture raised eggs two dozen for $8.00.

If there's not a Business Center near you, you can still get Chuck roll for $4.29/lb (ymmv). Buying bulk will save you a ton of money and will last you for the whole week or so.",

lbvr82v,t1_lbtllr1,1dv8e0z,Yes 100% no processed then your next step is to chose a farmer that’s only doing pasture raised meat. What people have to understand is that you eat the frequency of the animals thus this frequency is imprinted in you.,

- animal based, clean diet for 3 years now - no acne, gut is so much better
- any time I touch processed foods, oxalates, some nightshades, then the gut issues come back for a day, the processed foods/sugars will give me pimples",

l57k6ck,t3_1cy1i23,1cy1i23,"Ah I’m so happy for you! Amazing victory!

At around age 34 I’d had enough and I finally did the Accutane route for a year before I found the carni WOE. My only regret was not doing either thing sooner! I was also scared something bad would happen — but it turns out that I just needed to commit and get through it. Cystic acne is a horrible condition to live with and deserves proper treatment! 

Now my skin is stronger than ever and best of all it doesn’t hurt! I would recommend *both* Accutane and carni for anyone still suffering. The Accutane permanently shrinks the oil glands and the carni WOE will then keep it healthy. In fact, the drug itself is fat-soluble so they can truly work hand in hand. Fear tactics kept me from getting treatment AND changing my diet, and I wasted so much time like OP on other treatments without any results. 

Well done and congrats!! 🥳",🥳

A side effect of accutane was constipation so I started eating 100''s grams of Kellogg's bran flakes everyday which probably nuked my gut lining to oblivion. No surprise that I developed psoriasis in short order. Carnivore cured my cystic acne too.",
lc4tl26,t3_1cy1i23,1cy1i23,"This story truly gives me hope! I’ve been on an animal-based diet for almost six months, and it’s been pretty great—my skin and energy levels were fantastic! Although I had some cheat days here and there, my skin remained mostly clear, with only occasional breakouts around my period.

However, when I decided to increase my protein and butter intake, hoping to feel even better, I started getting painful cystic acne around my chin. These cysts are massive and incredibly painful!

I’m unsure if the issue is due to the increased dairy from the butter or the addition of more dried fruits (mangoes, pineapples, and dates) to my diet. To address this, I’ve decided to eliminate all dairy products and use tallow for cooking my meat and eggs instead.

Btw, for context, I’m a 32-year-old female. I’m sharing a picture of my skin with makeup on (I didn’t get a chance to take one without it), but you can still see the massive cysts.

Has anyone else experienced this? Should I consider going full carnivore, meaning no fruits or sugar at all?

I get angry reading stories like yours. So many doctors saw you and all they did was push drugs, never spoke about cutting out plant matter. I had the same thing with my bad gut issues, I'd go to the GP and they'd recommend MORE fibre. More plant matter. Even a fiber drink one time which landed me up in so much agony. I feel so much anger towards them, I can't help it. These doctors who push plants so hard have inflicted so much needless pain and discomfort. (I was also a vegan for 6 years... I was forcing myself to eat plates of green beans at one point trying to follow the usual fibre  advice, in spite of all the plants I was already eating and all the wholegrain crap. Nightmare)

I'm like you at the moment, currently doing just ground beef and water. I'm into my 4th week now. If I have to do this for 1 year or more to heal, I absolutely will, but it would be nice to be able to add eggs in eventually (at the moment I seem to have a bad reaction with them).",

I personally think it’s so sad what we do to the animals. :( I’ve been vegetarian since I was eight on and off, then vegan for a few years and recently I started mainly eating vegan and twice a week fish, usually wild caught salmon or mackerel for the omega 3s. I found that Giulia Enders really helped me understand the gut microbiome. She is a doctor who focuses on studying the gut micro biome and she said to eat as many different fruit and veggies as possible (30-40/week) would help heal the gut micro biome. I also had some issues with veggies or fruit in the last years here and there. Getting frequent breakouts as well. Now I eat something different everyday, basically the rainbow, instead of cutting out foods and reducing the diversity I eat and I feel the best I ever have. I also focus on getting 30g protein with each meal. My breakouts stopped. I feel energized and mentally switched on. I’m sharing this incase it helps someone, who went through the same as me and also struggles to introduce eating meat. I know some others also find it really hard.

I was basically just eating ground turkey, chicken breasts, olive oil, white rice, and baby carrots, and while that calmed my IBS/skin symptoms down a bit, I never felt like I was actually healing, and my skin can attest to that. I agree cutting out the plant toxins is what drove the majority of my results, but the meat gave me the proper nutrition to help heal my body, zero question.",

I really needed to hear this today because I have had 2 really great days and nights this last week where I was basically symptomless! And I was so happy, and I tried just increasing my fat intake by not draining off as much of the fat from my mince as I usually do, but doing that really set me back the last couple of days with really awful reflux at night etc. But I will just hold onto those couple of days and nights where things were recently so good, and just keep going and try to get back to there.

My biggest issue so far has been attempting to put more fat into my mince, either with butter or with leaving too much liquid fat in, and at the moment my gut just cannot seem to take it at all.

Anyway thanks for the encouragement.

RE: high fibre, the other thing that is so annoying is when people (and doctors) just say ""Introduce the fibre really slowly, have you tried that?"" Um. Yes. Yes I have. I was eating mostly fibre while I was a vegan. It's basically poison to my gut at this point, even a small amount sets me back so much.

I love fermented stuff like kimchi or sauerkraut, would be great to have that again, but I won't hold my breath. 

I did research microbiome quite a bit, and at my worst I was wishing I could have an FMT (still am to be honest, from what I have read it's highly beneficial but finding a good donor is the problem)",

Per your definition, I became a very strict vegan for weight loss and maintained the diet as I was diagnosed with a pre existing benign skin tumor (now removed) and warts that began on see-food diet (ate whatever I saw lol). I am doubtful whether my current health issues stemmed from the spike proteins in covid vaccine booster shot or dietary habits. Back in 2015, I cured a few finger warts on the Daniel fast and haven’t had any issues since, well the warts are back now, and this time, nothing seems to work. I adopted the McCullough Protocol and Natto food to target covid spike proteins today, so hopefully I’ll see an improvement in my immune system, if not, I may grill grass fed beef and wings all summer.

I take a digestive enzyme and betaine hcl with every meal. Betaine hcl increases your stomach acid which in return helps you digest meat and fat easier (antibiotics are shown to reduce stomach acid). Just this morning I could tell I put too much beef tallow in the pan to cook my eggs and I started getting reflux, so I took an additional betaine hcl and problem solved. Reflex is due to the lack of stomach acid and can actually help restore it (I used to take 15 per meal and now only need 1 or 2). I'd suggest trying them out (or try 1 TBSP of apple cider vinegar diluted in a small amount of water before a meal). Also avoid drinking any fluids 1 hour, during and 1 hour after your meals (unless you're taking pills/ apple cider vinegar like I just mentioned).

Yeah rendered fat is a big issue for many. I let my beef cool off for like 15 min before eating it, I try to not eat any liquid fat whatsoever. You could try eating cold butter to get more fat in. 

I also eat 3 meals per day about 5 hours apart. Zero snacking. This allows my MMC (migrating motor complex) to finish it's cycles properly.

Yeah I love pickles and always crave them but my stomach hates them. I'd suggest trying raw cheese (it is technically fermented and has probiotics in it), yogurt or kefir. Fermented dairy seems to be easier on my gut than fermented pants.

ljxt4x5,t1_l9i6848,1cy1i23,"Dark chocolate / cocoa is controversial for acne. There have been trials showing exacerbation of acne when people were supplemented with cocoa.

Almonds and pecans might have also been giving you trouble. Given that the proteins in nuts/seeds are harder to digest and that you said you have trouble with eggs (it's usually the egg proteins that cause problems).

It could also be possibly oxalate related, but that is just a theory at best based on the foods you used to eat, as it looks like you were eating quite high in oxalate foods:  
- Dark chocolate, spinach, almond products.

For the broccoli / cauliflower, I suggest boiling them like crazy and test if you have issues after that.

I gradually went less and less. This wasn't overnight. Athsma only went away when I eliminated all plant products except coffee. 

Before keto I ate anything and everything, it wasn't any specific food. It was plant products in general.

At the end there were maybe 3 to eliminate but those weren't the only ones that ever caused me issues obviously, because I didn't always eat broccoli.

ltc1la0,t3_1ga9txx,1ga9txx,"Two years ago, I was in a very different place.

In the picture on the left, I had just come home after 36 days in rehab for alcohol addiction. I weighed 328 lbs, had zero energy, and felt like I was barely getting by. My life was spiraling out of control—mentally, physically, and spiritually. It took hitting rock bottom for me to realize I had to make a change.

The journey wasn't easy. I tried everything from keto to intense workouts, but the real game-changer came when I fully committed to the carnivore diet. I cut out carbs and sugars cold turkey, and it was harder than detoxing from alcohol. But slowly, things started to turn around. After months of sticking to it and prioritizing my health, I now weigh 186 lbs and feel stronger, clearer, and more connected than ever.

Started strict (ish) Carnivore in April and the results have been truly remarkable. I haven't had a sip of alcohol since the 9 Jack Daniels I crushed on the flight to rehab.

This transformation is about more than just weight loss—it's about taking control of your life, healing from addiction, and becoming the best version of yourself for your family and your own well-being. You can't help others until you help yourself.

If you’ve ever struggled with weight, addiction, or finding balance in your life, I can tell you there’s a way out. It takes time, a SHITLOAD of discipline, and the right support, but it’s possible. If I can do this so can you! Let’s go!

Note: I have a giant umbilical hernia which is really ruining the appearance of my stomach. But, hey, I’ll take that over having a Mack truck tire around my waist. I am going to need to get it removed soon. Certainly not looking forward to that!",
ltc25aa,t3_1ga9txx,1ga9txx,"Ahh I remember the t-shirt in the swimming pool days.

ltcyb10,t3_1ga9txx,1ga9txx,Good job with sticking with it. I started carnivore 7 weeks ago. I never feel hungry and most of the time I don’t feel like eating at all. I hope to lose 95-100 pounds. The only problem I’m having is with my stomach. For the last 2 weeks every time I eat my stomach feels like crap and zaps all my energy also. I’ve read that the stomach thing could last up to a month or so. I sure hope not,
ltiffkj,t3_1ga9txx,1ga9txx,Buddy... I Too had a major alcohol addiction. I'm of course now nearing my first month and I'm somewhat struggling but making it happen. I Hope I can lose at the very least 45lbs. Congrats on your success !!! stay sober !,
ltdgvs6,t3_1ga9txx,1ga9txx,"this is so great. I too suffered from addiction and have implemented a carnivore diet. it has conpletley changed my life for the better.

lkzxkvi,t3_1f58oxa,1f58oxa,"My guy, first of all I just want to echo what everyone else is saying. What an epic transformation! It's very inspiring!

  
So I have some questions if you're okay to answer them for me, I'm starting from 414lbs, I became disabled in 2018 after a violent attack at work and had my leg broken in 12 places. The weight absolutely ballooned on me due to my lack of mobility. So my first question is whether your transformation was all diet or did you exercise as well?

  
Secondly, with losing a lot of weight so quickly do you have any loose skin or other issues?",
ll2jr9j,t3_1f58oxa,1f58oxa,"Amazing transformation! Bravo! 
We all need to lose whatever doesn’t serve us. Physically and energetically. You are beaming with light! Keep on shinning!",

lkrhk0a,t1_lkrcx88,1f58oxa,"Thank ya!

I do one meal per day with eating around 5pm. A typical meal is maybe 1 pound of meat. Now I love to cook and make a ton of different styles of food that fall under the ""dirty carnivore"" term if you will. Sometimes I will just do a 3 day fast thrown in there when I'm feeling it.

I do lift weights and resistance training as well every other day, with not a ton of extra focused cardio.

Ive been pondering making my own cookbook for our way of life",

lks8nvr,t1_lkrgfee,1f58oxa,"I shared these in another comment, but I am down 145 pounds so far. I tend to eat around a pound of meat per day, but I haven't and never will track macros. I stick to one meal per day with the occasional three day fast thrown in there if I feel I need a reset. Some might say that I am undereating but to be honest most days I couldn't eat any more than I am. I am able to trust my hunger signals and know when to stop.",

lkwepyo,t1_lksa4gn,1f58oxa,"Physically has been probably the biggest shift. I am able to play with my kids more now, I have energy throughout the day with no dip, sleep has been life changing and promoted a much better state for me overall. When you were as overweight as I was, there are a lot of things you take for granted. Flying on a plane with the tiny seats is super uncomfortable and you feel sorry for the person next to you. Buying clothes at a very select few stores with a limited selection. Walking into a room and feeling like a whale out of water sometimes. While I do have more to go, I no longer feel like the outcast in the room. As weird as it sounds sometimes I just wanted to ""fit"" in. I have always been fairly confident in my own skin, but this change so far has taken me to a new level of self-confidence.",

lkwa3le,t1_lktexyf,1f58oxa,"That is a great result for you so far. I will say yes, I did go through a time where the scale almost didn't move for weeks. The main thing is don't worry as hard as that is to hear. If you are noticing a stall, I would recommend changing your routine up completely. Try throwing in a 3 day water fast and see how your body reacts(something I would continually do if I saw a stall). Switch up the food you are eating whether it's consuming less or a different meat altogether. Dairy has been a component for stalling a lot of people including myself as well. If you are consuming dairy try and eliminate it for a couple of weeks.

This is what has worked for me and may or may not work for you or others. I would say don't be afraid to mix it up. Hopefully we all know the definition of insanity.",

ll1ml72,t1_lkzxkvi,1f58oxa,"I truly appreciate that!

I would be happy to answer your questions, especially if it can hopefully help you or anyone else out.

1. Now I'm sorry about your accident and I hate to use this term as an example but I can't think of another saying that describes this more than: ""You can never out run a bad diet"". I attribute my progress this far to about 80-90% to this way of life. While I have been far more mobile inherently to shedding the weight, I haven't been doing any crazy amounts of cardio or anything along those lines.

2. Losing this amount of weight this quickly, I do have some loose skin which is inevitable. One of my reasons for leveraging intermittent fasting and prolonged fasting is for autophagy and hoping to reduce loose skin as much as possible. I hope I will not have to have any skin removal surgery in the future but we will see when I reach that point. I would take loose skin all day compared to before. Heard someone say ""wear your loose skin like a badge of honor"", so that is how I'm trying to look at it for the time being.

Good luck on your journey.",

I've done carnivore before, had some success with it but I've a very unhealthy relationship with food and tend to eat my feelings. I'm also an out and out sugar addict. This time though I'm determined to stick to it. I'm sick of being fat, sick of being practically housebound and on the rare occasion I do get out, it ruining me for days afterwards.

2. Honestly, I've thought about it a long time but never pulled the trigger to start. I call it divine intervention but I happened to be on YouTube one day and a video about the carnivore diet popped into my feed. I clicked on it for some reason and was hooked. Started the next day.",

Plus a eat avocado a couple of times a week and an occasional olive or two.  My cholesterol went up.  I was prepared to get scolded.  She didn't.  She said it would be better if it wasn't so high but she said it was normal to have a higher cholesterol when you eat a keto diet like this.  She says we'll watch it.

Our program does a decent job of integrating more than the colloquial “single lecture” on nutrition. 

That being said, I have friends in other programs and certainly the exposure they get is almost nothing. Unfortunately I just think it’s the result of ever expanding medical knowledge base that we have to get through in 4 years, and the philosophy of allopathic medical schools doesn’t emphasize the bigger picture of preventative care. It’s up to the individual to appreciate the massive role diet and lifestyle play in human health, and then choose how they want to integrate it into their practice after residency.",

I then came to Reddit and lurked for about a month wading through all the good, bad and ugly posts and comments. The folks here linked a lot of amazing information and are pretty good at flagging the garbage.

lzvlot9,t1_lzve3xb,1h3c3a0,"Thank you, that's a good example.

True science constantly questions held beliefs. And nutrition science is far from ""settled"".",

lzw0q3n,t1_lzves8g,1h3c3a0,"I guess you “struggle to find flaws” because it’s telling you what you want to hear.

Even the references linked to that video talk about varied diets including plants.

This subreddit’s flimsy house of cards is built on the fantasy that proto-humans ate strictly carnivorous—that carbohydrates are the cofactor causing atherosclerosis—based on a fairy tale about our ancestors not ever eating them, and just eating fatty meats. Absolute fucking idiocy.",

lp0h6bo,t3_1foo504,1foo504,I've been carnivore for 3 years. I have autoimmune.  I've been able to cut down on my medication for autoimmune at least in half. I also feel that this food plan is the key to addiction.  My body is healing.  Congratulations to you! What an amazing way to feel.,
lp0ll44,t3_1foo504,1foo504,My scale told a similar tale once I started carnivore. Sharp drop to my current stable weight with daily fluctuations up and down based on amounts of food ingested and when I weighed myself.,

lptogwi,t3_1foo504,1foo504,"Damn, girl!! 3½ months has made a significant impact. 🙌👏🌟 I struggle with binge eating and sugar addiction, so I understand the struggle. I could really use even just one friend who believed in what I'm doing, if you or anyone on here wanted to connect via fb. I don't typically add strangers, but I post a lot of carnivore things and no one looks at them, and I wish I could get enough traction that even one person on my fb would pay attention to and take seriously. Instead, I continue to go to family functions (I actually quit going to meet friends out and about bc it's not worth it) and they still push foods I struggle to say no to. Pride is probably the only thing that gets me thru any holiday dinner at this point. My entire family in on fb and everyone has a host of problems that going carnivore would solve, but they just think I'm doing some crazy new trend. 🙄😒🙁",🙌👏🌟🙄😒🙁

kxxiebj,t1_kxxhq6y,1bv6o7e,"I did BBBE. I actually live in montana but I do have access to great beef. Mostly I just eat ribeyes, bacon and eggs. No dairy, salt, and some tabasco as seasonings and occasionally pickled jalapeños. I only drink water or sparkling water. No sweeteners",

ky070zp,t1_kxzkiyx,1bv6o7e,"Definitely, man. Carnivore healed my suicidal depression and crippling anxiety. It's one of the things I most amazed by. That and the fact that my addictive personality and compulsive tendencies went away",
kxzsyff,t1_kxzr8dt,1bv6o7e,"I have an allergy to milk, and the inflammation caused me to be extremely obese when I was younger. I could not actually drink plain milk, it made my stomach hurt bad within minutes of consuming, but I had no idea the damage that milk protein that was in other foods was doing to me. When I gave up milk, I lost almost 40 pounds without even trying. I must have other issues too of course, before this I had been doing keto for almost a decade but switched to carnivore last year to see if I could get rid of the rest of the weight and psoriasis. I lost another 20 lbs immediately. I still have a little to go that’s just freaking stubborn. I think I might be sensitive to protein. So experimenting with higher fat to protein ratio, which is a bitch when you can’t have butter or cream. 

Overall, I weighed about 300 lbs in high school. I’m about 145 now, and should weigh about 130-35.",

ky0yvdr,t1_ky0duqa,1bv6o7e,Thank you so much. I do think that Anxiety is the cause of alot of people addiction and self medicating. And I think Anxiety is caused my malnutrition and insulin resistance causing a hormone imbalance,

ky02gir,t1_kxzrw98,1bv6o7e,"I won’t, too much effort.  And their hands are tied.  Plus some disease states need different diets.  I’ve def had people look at me weird when I’ve done carnivore and admitted it to them, but it just comes with doing something that is still considered a no-no.",
kxz1a64,t1_kxz16os,1bv6o7e,I’m sure it was. But I was mostly referring to them not being in chronological order lol,
kxy305n,t1_kxxxe6b,1bv6o7e,Happy for ya! Grillin up a steak in your name as we speak.,
ky06jzm,t1_kxzsyff,1bv6o7e,So I find that I have to eat a 2 to 1 fat to protine ratio and for me beef tallow is king. I feel amazing on beef tallow. I get the Chicago waygu tallow on amazon in the black container. I make a dip out of it and dip my steaks in it or I make ground beef and mix in tallow and then let ot set and cool to room temperature so that tallow hardens.,

ky4qrp9,t1_kxyac9x,1bv6o7e,"It doesn't fit the strict definition of carnivore, but things like pickles, kimchi, olives, or even avocado are fine by me. They avoid the worst parts of plant foods.

It is about the benefits that this type of diet brings and staying in the spirit of it in terms of macros, etc. However if someone were going to argue with me I would say it's not carnivore, but it is fine as long as the results are there.",

lxd1ahz,t1_lxcqgqj,1gs6s6y,I knew I had an intention to start and so I tried to eat as much as I could that was still in my pantry and then when it was time to get groceries I just got all carnivore stuff. I wasn’t sure what I’d like so I over did some things. In the beginning I also liked to make more than one protein so that it felt like having a meat and a “side dish”. I have an instagram that I post my foods on. It was a little hard at first but it gets really easy after the food noise is gone,

My skin always hurt (like hugs and touching felt like my skin was being peeled off. My heels were SO cracked and dry it was painful and now I have NONE of those symptoms and things that I didn’t even realize were wrong, are just gone. It’s crazy how much it has changed my life.",

Maybe a typical day is 5-6 eggs with some sort of meat, and then salmon and steak for dinner. Lately I’ve been super into chicken things.

m1g1skc,t1_m1g071e,1gs6s6y,I eat 5-6 eggs a day and I’m not sure how many grams of meat. But an example day of eating is 5 scrambled eggs and then a larger lunch of steak and chicken thighs or steak and salmon. I try to not eat too close to bed,

lc9mtaz,t3_1dya228,1dya228,"This is insane progress. I hate that your family bullies you. You deserve only praise and encouragement for turning your life around. 

They are envious and jealous and they can’t do it and so they want you to be miserable like they are. Because changing yourself is a shocking mirror to them. It makes them have to look at themselves and realize that they too need to change but somehow can’t get themselves to do it. 

OP it’s not your task or responsibility to change your family or even be liked by them or get their approval. You do what’s good for you. This is your one and only life.

I for one am glad you’re doing this for yourself. You should be proud of yourself for sure. I found this way of eating last year, but I started like January 8th I’m on Day 179 and no slips no trips! I lost 65 pounds and I reversed my diabetes that I had for over 12 years with insulin shots twice a day!! This is for sure the proper human diet!!
 Keep up the good work man. 
   Oh listen, not saying you will, but if it happens, if you slip, just get right back up man and keep on keeping on! No biggie, just a stumble. What you shouldn’t do is give in to the feelings of failure or whatever emotions come with the stumble. Because you only fail if you quit and your health is far more important than anything you used to eat! Don’t you think so too? I believe in you bro and I believe in this way of eating!

Water and coffee only. (I may cut out the coffee soon). I feel WAY better, have a ton of energy, and am losing a little bit of weight. Keep up the good work.

You look great, I have similar results. 88kg down to around 78kg. I wasn't hungry, but was loosing too much weight.


I come off Carnavour and ate junk out of frustration due to being told I needed to come off it due to it being antisocial to my family life. Anyway, that aside I'm now back on Carnavour but this time doing it different and with support from my family. I eat more, last time I didn't get enough calories. I lost weight fast and family members worried.



I now have 6 scrambled eggs, 100g smoked salmon for breakfast. This is around 800cals


Lunch , Thick cut beaf steak, around 400cals, 2 eggs and 4 chicken thighs and a bag of pork scratchings.


Dinner I have 500g beef mince, 4 chick thighs.


I try to hit 1000cal a meal, I need 3k minimum due to active work.


Thought I'd give some input, as similar situation. I also swear by an air fryer, also a camping stove so you can cook steak at work.",

m093v9o,t3_1h53t9y,1h53t9y,"That's a killer diet dude! I have to research to remember some of the recent things I've come upon that help suppress hunger in a healthy manner.

It sounds like you may have trouble absorbing some nutrients. I don't think you're eating too little, but if you aren't feeling satiated & you're off of sugar & grains I suspect something is off.

When I spoke to you earlier I mentioned the importance of your poo. So let's get personal. What kind of stool are you producing? Does it float or sink? How clean is it when you wipe? 😂",😂

m0c26sm,t3_1h53t9y,1h53t9y,Hey so I’m curious about your starting weight and your height. Plus how much do you eat on Carnivore? I was considering it but I can’t seem to find any clear numbers for how much to eat on carnivore.,
m0c3wzc,t3_1h53t9y,1h53t9y,Sorry no advice to give but drop the workout routine,
m0ct9zy,t3_1h53t9y,1h53t9y,"Don't listen to all these other guys about you need to do this or that eat more fat etc..We are all different and I went through that exact thing you are going through. Your body is lacking certain nutrients, and it's telling you this through hunger pains.. I started eating grass fed organ liver wurst from US wellness meats, and it helped greatly, but ultimately, you need to find whole food carbs that suit you or you need to eat more organ meats..I started eating around 20 to 30 grams of carbs a day and it changed me for the better 💯. Good luck! What you're going through sucks I been there",💯
m0m5t0z,t3_1h53t9y,1h53t9y,Dude how did you get such a good physique in 4 months ove been training for 15 months and still don't got anywhere near that to be fair I'm not pn Carnivore is that really the key?,
m0phbeu,t3_1h53t9y,1h53t9y,"You have a lean body mass like I do. I’m very active as well with work. What worked for me through trying doing things out was…. Switching to day time eating helped out a lot between 7am and 5 or 6 pm. When I ate a lot at night it messed up my sleep. I would notice it on my whoop. 
You might be under eating and not getting enough. One meal a day or time restricted eating is good for some but once I got lean I had to eat more times of the day because I was not getting enough calories in my diet. 
The last thing that helped me out a lot was iodine supplementing. I was having signs of hypothyroidism and supplementation of iodine really helped. You don’t need to supplement. You can simply get more seafood in diet but supplementing iodine changed a lot for me. Listen to your body. Are you cold when you shouldn’t be. Dry skin or irritated for no apparent reason. Sleep problems. Do research on the iodine before hand too. Dr ken berry has some videos on it. I think if your hungry on carnivore then looking at how much and when you time your eating helps.",
m0qijsq,t3_1h53t9y,1h53t9y,"Honestly, this is a great transformation, well done to you!! I’m jealous and in awe every time I see pics like this . 
I hope you don’t mind my comments but view it more as a distant bit advice from someone who’s ‘been there’ … and admittedly struggles drastically from the aftermath, but has also witnessed the health effects of other athletes or sporting individuals.
I understand the mental changes let alone the body stimulation which a completely protein based diet can have. However, if you can ( and take it from someone who’s suffered extreme illness from intense diets and training,) remember your whole entire self needs to be fuelled AND CARED for; for the long term. Solid health is not sustainable or healthy with a protein diet alone in the long run. 
It’s not just your aesthetics/ physical self that should be considered I’m afraid to say, or your mental health. Consider your neurological health, your systemics and so on for a healthy and long lasting life, and what we need to actually function for the long run, please 🙏🏻 ",🙏🏻
m033bpr,t3_1h53t9y,1h53t9y,"Just remember that being lean isn’t everything and you shouldn’t try to cut fat indefinitely because without fat reserves, when you go a day without food, you eat your muscle mass

Edit: FOR OP, not Fr4nkWh1te

I should have also said this:  if you don’t eat organs, you are literally starving your organs to death. If you don’t eat raw enzymes, your body will fight to digest what you eat and use your youth until it cannot create enzymes anymore.

Think of your body like a copy from nature. If you eat muscle meat, your muscles thrive.  If you eat heart, your heart thrives. Every second you go while your brain and liver and testicles starve is another day they shrink.

Remember that stomach acid cannot be created without cholesterol.  

And let me make it very clear: 

Cholesterol, like every other heat-sensitive bio available nutrient, gets eviscerated by heat. It turns into six other different kinds of oxidized crap. Raw cholesterol is one of the many building blocks that your body is designed to encounter. 

Every vitamin you know is capable of being completely destroyed by heat. 

Most vitamins are destroyed by temperatures preceding 125°F. 

Cooking is insane. It should only be done to plants, because they are toxic and must be cooked in order to be eaten in times of starvation from animals. 

If you don’t want to feel like you’re never satiated while others tell you “you look great”, you’re going to have to do what your doctor tells you not to do. You’re going to have to find a farm that cares about their livestock, allows them to eat according to their nature, and doesn’t touch them with human medicine. 

You’re going to have to try a more natural way of eating. No processing.",

m0728o0,t3_1h53t9y,1h53t9y,"Just eat more, also 4 month carnivore is not super long and you young and working out heavy.

Fatigue and low energy or constipation means you need more fat.

Hunger is different, either your body saying it missing something or you simply need to eat more (total calories).  Adding some vitamin D and drink more water + electrolyte supplement may help hunger if that is what you body is asking for.

Fat has more calories than protein, but gallbladder limited to how much fat you can eat at each sit down.  If you go over its limit in one eating session then say hello to runny tummy.  So add fat until you get to lose stools then cut back a bit ... then you know you getting correct animal fat amounts.

Personally if I do any dairy I pick up weight fast ... some people though fine with it.

Keep aiming for 0 carbs, or < 10g.  If you still getting > 10g carbs it will make you feel hungry.  You can easily check if you in Ketosis either by the smell of you urine or pee on a ketosis stick.  But if you get in more than 10g carbs it triggers hunger too.

Oh and stay away from alcohol even zero carb like Scotch etc.  Probably my own downfall too, even though carnivore  for more than 2 years.   I drink way to much Scotch and Bourbon.   Problem with alcohol is it toxic to your body and body prioritize removing it over even carbs before it gets back to full fat burning and will also mess with your triglycerides and can trigger hunger -- I know this and still I drink :(

Other things you can do is eat more often ... you body allows you to eat more that way rather than just one sitting.

For hunger snacking biltong or home made jerky.  Store bought super bad, in USA for some reason every freaking thing even beef sugar coated :(

As for cuts of meat, ribeyes (if you have the money) , flap speak, oxtail, short ribs, lamb ... any fatty cuts.  Pork belly, beacon.  Eggs/raw or cooked.  Chicken, over not worth it ... except for maybe chicken thighs (more skin and fat on it).  I do chicken liver Portuguese style for organs.  Beef liver I cant eat cooked, I dont really it that byt when I do I eat it raw chuck down with soda water.  I dont do dairy (but your choice though).  I just mention organs as if your hunger is due to body wanting something, maybe organs will help.",
m083tmi,t3_1h53t9y,1h53t9y,"Dairy is a hot-button item, but I personally thrive on it. It keeps my appetite in check, and studies have shown that it has a unique ability to regulate appetite. I use about a pint or two of heavy cream a day (or half and half, depending on what's in the fridge), which saves me a lot of money.

Don't be surprised if you initially bulk when incorporating it. I found that many old injuries began to heal, which had some initial bloating but repaired itself.",

m05baq0,t1_m03izn8,1h53t9y,"I am female but also have a very busy lifestyle with a busy family.  Some tips I can offer you are to meal prep for a few days time.  I eat on average 1.5 lbs of beef a day.  So I'll make some quick meatballs or patties and put it in the air fryer, at least 3 lbs worth, and it's done in 20 minutes.  I dump it all (including the fat from the tray, you need the fats) into glass storage container.  I salt everything.  Then that's my food for the next couple days.  
I also eat chicken, and if you have a slow cooker or a grill or a smoker, prep is very easy. 
You can always take the cooked meat from the fridge and add eggs to it. (Scramble eggs in lots of butter in pan, dump in meat, salt and then eat)

Hard boiled eggs make a great option too, to help fill out a meal.  I slice them in half and put a pat of butter in between the halves.  It's a tasty sandwich snack.

I also add an egg yolk and a good dallop of tallow to my coffee and blend it.  More easy and satiating fats.",

The body does not run like a car. IF it stores fat it must be with adequate vitamins otherwise you will spend your own vitamins utilizing your own storages.

It is especially crucial for those who come from the mindset that they “look fat” and need to “look healthy” (whatever that means to them), that they understand there are people who maintain an even higher body fat, but still don’t consume everything that their body requires, such that they starve while being supported by their own community.",
m03rihp,t1_m033y6v,1h53t9y,"Yes, you do. At least 50% of the calories, you consume should come from fat. But at least 70% of the protein you consume should come from organs. If you focus on this. Fat will fill in the rest. Organs and fresh fatty tissue are fucking delicious. They are the most buttery thing I can think of. The most satiating and vitalizing thing.

And when you’re looking for protein, look for organs. In order to digest macro nutrients you need vitamins, and there are not enough vitamins in muscle meat to satiate the human body. I would go insane on muscle meat.

It’s very important that you do this, because the only parts of your body that are made of fat after you lose your body fat is… well one: your brain. 

If you don’t want your body to desperately eat your brain, eat more fat. Bone marrow and brain are my favorite. As fresh as possible and raw, of course.

Have you ever eaten raw organs? Were youable to find research about people who force themselves to eat organs past the point where their body says “stop, I am satiated”?

Toxic levels of vitamins stem from high supplement intake and the mix of natural, derived “vitamins” like beta carotene (which is not a vitamin) and enhancers (vitamin boosters). Toxicities of “fat-soluble vitamins” (artificial) can also be caused by a large intake of highly fortified foods, but natural food rarely delivers extreme or dangerous levels of fat-soluble vitamins, unless you were to eat to the point of vomiting, which would solve the problem.

m092n8s,t1_m07w1iz,1h53t9y,"I protest what you're saying because you state what he should do as though it were a fact that it’s what he needs without room for error on your end. Words like ""probably"" and ""most likely"" and ""what I've found"" etc. are a way to share your knowledge without unintentionally 'gaslighting' someome into making the wrong decision because you happened to be incorrect and they didn't think to question you. It encourages better thinking AND better attunement to ones intuition on the part of the listener if you use nuance. It also demonstrates that you actually know what you're talking about whereas lack of nuance is often a red flag that someone is either repeating information without discernment, or making things up  (though I suspect it's usually repeating without discernment).

I have had bites of raw organs  (though my only complete meals were cooked).


You say now ""eat organs until your body says you're satiated"" but in your original comment, you gave a minimum percentage of how much protein should come from organs. I agree you should stop when your body says stop. Could you please elaborate on how this aligns with your original claim about how much organs you should be eating?  (I recall you said 70% of your protein should come from organs. Reddit won't let me see that comment while Im typing).


I have not looked deeply into organ meat but what I HAVE looked deeply into has taught me that almost every issue is far to complex for anyone (other than people who INTENSLY deep dive over long periods of time should be sharing their perspectives without appropriate caveats. (See The Dunning Kruger Effect for more information).  Everybody could easily assume they're right, especially after having done research and yet many people come to radically different conclusions--despite the fact that many people who disagree have done their own research.  Better to maintain  intellectual honesty, in my firmly held opinion.


Additionally, I apologize and ammend that my first sentence should have said  ""I'm pretty sure hypervitaminosis is a real thing.""  I can't remember if I was being careless or if I just forgot to type it, but I lacked intellectual honesty in that sentence and for that, I apologize.",

I used to be sick, less intelligent than I am now, and followed blasphemic eating practices. It’s all about reality. I understand the fundamentals so there is zero room for error on my end. 

I’ve invested 8 years into understanding the human body’s nutritional needs through personal experimentation with a raw organ-based diet. My confidence in this approach stems from direct experience, not speculation or theory. I’m happy to share my insights with those who are genuinely interested in learning.

Words like “probably” and “most likely” and “what I’ve found” etc. aren’t an accurate way of communicating the reality about something for me. In my defense, I’m sure you would agree no one says “I have found the sky to be blue.” 

I apologize for my pedantic pattern of commutation, but I care deeply about syntax, pragmatics, and semantics, which is why I communicate in the way that I do.

Your lack of experience is where your mountain of doubt lies, fundamentally.

If they chose to derive 70% of their protein intake to come from organs, rather than the preferred 100% (if we aren’t counting fresh beef blood) just due to fear of organs themselves, they would naturally be able to acclimate mentally and understand satiety on their own. 

One should always eat until satiated. That should be obvious. 

If you want to maintain intellectual honesty, then continue to question what I comment, maybe you’ll learn something (like about the Maillard reaction and reactive oxygen species) because I will always have a really nice reply for you. It is likely that anything you type will be something that someone else would have typed. So, I’m prepared. I like answering questions that are easy to answer, even if that answer is complex.",

4 eggs w/ 1 cup mozzarella mixed into the waffle irons for some carnivore waffles w/ a quarter stick of butter on top.

Around 10 or 11 I usually eat around a 1 pound chuck steak with half a stick of butter.

Dinner….well sometimes it’s half a dozen eggs, sometimes it’s another pound of steak or organ meat, sometimes it’s nothing…yeah not gonna lie I truly do only eat when hungry.

Carnivore really taught me to eat to live not live to eat if that makes sense.

Snacking consists of hard cheese or butter typically sharp cheddar which I bake and make into carnivore crackers….with the risk of people freaking out I eat brown mustard on them because it’s delicious",
l2446tn,t1_l243qqj,1chgbia,"Nah, I had diet soda her and there, drank aminos as well for some flavor. I ran most days but not everyday I’d do at least 45 mins of something everyday some days 1.5 hours just depended on the day. As I lost weight things got easier so I intensified difficulty. I guess the best way to say it is I kept upping the standard as the standard became easy.",
l265m7g,t1_l26550l,1chgbia,I ran faster than the average runner without training for it. Energy was fine and constant the whole time. Breakfast consisted of 7 eggs 2 cups of cheese mixed together and cooked in waffle iron then coated in cream cheese for a topping. Only thing I would change is taking salt packets with me to down with water as I did get minor cramping around mile 11,

Just an example and I usually do 4 or 5 circuits takes me approximately 45 minutes. Usually get in around 2-300 pushups a day if not more and I try to get at least 300 body weight lunges in a day. Usually in the afternoon I’ll try to run a couple of miles or do 20-30 mins of alternating kettlebell carries on 15 degree incline,

l230n9m,t1_l22d5ub,1chgbia,Do you do a lot of steady state cardio? That keeps cortisol high and might be the reason for the loose skin,

l22gp9t,t1_l22gfxm,1chgbia,Collagen is protein though so it should be low in calories. However I don’t do calories in or out. Some days I eat 5000 calories some days I eat 2000 I just eat until satiated,
l22gihc,t1_l22gfxm,1chgbia,Some use collagen peptides in the powder. For a long time I ate skinned chicken thighs to get it but unsure how much I was getting,

l274dcj,t1_l24v4y7,1chgbia,I can tell you didn't read the article. I don't care whether it's labeled gelatine or collagen. BUT I DO CARE IF IT HAS HEAVY METALS IN IT!! Don't buy something just because it's cheap.,

ls10087,t3_1g264l4,1g264l4,"Keep up the good work. You might want to change up some, from a stricter lion diet to add in some fats. Hint - they wont make you fat, but they will give you energy! Dont give up on the salt. By just adding in salt you reduce or eliminate the need to add in electrolytes (as some are willing to sell you). Ive been doing this 3 years now, down 150+ lbs, feel 30 years younger. I still have a journey but this is also a way of eating, not just some diet. Ive not eaten a veggie or fruit or nut or any of that in the whole time, and I dont miss it. I found over my time, my body tells me what it wants and doesnt want. Whether its fatty beef, bacon or portk, chicken, cheeses, shrimp, etc. Over the three years Ive lost weight at different rates, it goes in spurts, it plateaus, it ebbs or stops, it starts again slow, but I still lose weight. If I can discipline myself to exercise regularly Im sure I would lose faster, lol. In all my past three years, Ive not gained weight back. Keep up your motivations, dont sweat the small details, stick to your plan. Of note I no longer have high blood pressure, diabetes, breathing issues, and more.

Protein shake, high protein no sugar yogurt, avocado and almond milk. Some ham & eggs for lunch, some bone broth, meat, and leafy greens like spinach and romaine for dinner. 

Going for the healthy fats and some red meat. I can’t see all red meat. I’ve got a fatty liver and high Blood Pressure. I’ve heard carnivore can help fatty liver, heard can make worse also. 

Can’t break down fat so well, as I don’t have a gallon bladder.",

lrvu61j,t1_lrpgete,1g264l4,"Haha. Well fwiw I lost the first 8-9 rapidly (I think that was just the water) then I didn’t lose anything else for about a month, then I wasn’t as hungry and I starter to lose about 1-2 lbs a week. So it did take a little time, I was confused because my husband lost consistently quite quickly but my body took longer. Also when we traveled in the end of Sept for two weeks I didn’t lose anything, I think the stress of travel my body was just stabilizing. My priority has been healing the autoimmune rather than losing weight so I just didn’t worry about it but it did start then!",

ltf2oau,t1_lt2jvld,1g264l4,"Of course she is. You just look at it through limited usefulness. I went carnivore after hearing about her Father, then watching her video. I was them determined to try carnivore for 2 weeks. I did research on my own. So in a manner, I did not EAT EXACTLY like her, but saw what I could maybe look forward to. Now 3 years later I am healthy, happy and doing amazing. If all you have is trying to put someone elses views down, YOU are the problem. Go find others to troll. I came here to share and help.",

lnwhjji,t3_1fkldsj,1fkldsj,Way to go! For me going very low carb was also the only thing that worked against my sugar addiction. I can’t go full carnivore because of digestion issues but I go as close as I can get.,

lnypl62,t1_lnyjy29,1fkldsj,"I wouldn't eat anything fried in seed oils, maybe you can find a place that fries in tallow instead (buffalo wild wings?). I bake my own wings though. Easy as long as you can wash a baking rack. Alternatively, start keto and go carnivore over time to get used to it.

I've found success in eating high quality burgers (prime brisket) with ketchup and it kept me going for weeks. Bake some juicy pork chops, eat with a buttery sauce, have some bacon and eggs, there's lots to do! 

Good luck!",

lo3741c,t1_lo33zef,1fkldsj,@christnyfollow above referenced feeling guilty for eating 4 or 5 rashers of bacon. Because pre carnivore that would have been judged as being greedy or harmful. Sometimes I eat til I’m ‘Christmas dinner full’ and I feel so guilty and ‘bad’ but then I remember it was all carnivore so it’s ok!,

lo4dlc8,t1_lo3741c,1fkldsj,"Thank you for clarifying! That's what I thought was being mentioned. I know I grew up the same way, that eating too much (especially pork) was always frowned upon.

m865bop,t1_m85k51e,1i5fagh,People get gout without being carnivore. Just because it coincided with three days into carnivore doesn’t mean carnivore caused it. Watch Dr Ken Berry and look up gout on his channel.,

m876fmq,t1_m865bop,1i5fagh,Well all my outbreaks that I've had in the past few years have always occurred after a high consumption of red meat. That's the pattern I've noticed for myself.,
m85trly,t1_m85t0bb,1i5fagh,"Yeah so I've noticed that majority of my outbreaks have been due to foods in high purine.

In the first day, I had eggs(which was fine) steak with cheese ~ kept it light but the next two days I had lamb liver with salad.

Then the forth day woke up in immense pain. I'm absolutely gutted and scared to try it again.",
m867k2k,t1_m85trly,1i5fagh,"I'd never heard of such a symptom. Had you been okay with meat before that happened? 

I've been much healthier on a 95% beef diet, fortunately. Along this elimination diet journey, I also found out that egg whites give me dyshidrotic eczema on my right foot.",
m86lsb5,t1_m85trly,1i5fagh,"What many people experience in the initial stages of going off carbs is an initial gout outbreak, especially if it has been happening numerous times in their life, followed by a lack of gout outbreaks afterwards. You will have much greater success if you take things a bit slower during your transition to mostly meat and avoid over eating organ meats.",
m875ywb,t1_m867k2k,1i5fagh,"I don't understand why I'm being downvoted... I'm actually sad that I cant partake in this. People are weird man.

In the past two years, I've noticed that when in a week I eat red meat a lot more than I usually would eventually it would just breakout and then im literally bedbound for following 3 weeks, trying to walk is excruating.

Literally getting to the bathroom itself is a mission.",
m8767q3,t1_m86lsb5,1i5fagh,So you're essentially advising the lower the carbs and increase meat slowly over a long period of time instead of going cold turkey ?,
m87aqlv,t1_m8767q3,1i5fagh,"Essentially, yes. I began eating this way due to autoimmune issues, and I also have a history of gout. I started it as an elimination diet and felt so good I never bothered to add much back in. Many folks say just jump in, but I wanted to avoid going through carb withdrawals  and the stomach upset that comes with it. 

If you are asking advice, take it slow. Stop all the sugar foods and bread and replace them with root veggies other than sweet potatoes or potatoes. This is hard enough in my experience. When you do this, make sure to take some electrolytes that do not have sugars in them and make sure to drink plenty of water. When I shifted my diet I still had my big toe get hit with the gout, but it was not terrible compared to previous outbreaks. After that, it went away and has not come back. 

Keep in mind too, that as your body tries to heal up, you will very likely experience mild joint issues throughout your body. It will come and go almost in waves over time. I interpreted this as my body trying to heal my joints, rather than seemingly being intent on destroying my joints. It takes time though, and causing all of it to happen at once by going cold turkey so to speak is not pleasant. Here on the other side of it, with my joint pains so greatly reduced, I found it an entirely worthwhile process. But make sure to take the steps you can to ameliorate the less pleasant effects of the healing process. Good luck with it!",
m87c2fi,t1_m87aqlv,1i5fagh,"Thank you for your time and effort on this, this is really good advice which I'll take on board. Stay blessed :)",
m87f32w,t1_m87aqlv,1i5fagh,"That's really good advice since everybody's body reacts differently to this diet. I went cold turkey because I didn’t know much about it at first. Fortunately, I didn’t experience pain or anything, just some digestive issues. I’ve also seen Steak & Butter Gal recommend a gradual transition.",
m87hzlt,t1_m87c2fi,1i5fagh,"This diet is definitely worth trying for a while, especially for those looking to significantly improve their health. By taking it slow, you'll probably be able to adjust your body accordingly and troubleshoot any issues that arise, making it easier to identify the root cause of potential challenges.",
m87i6jv,t1_m87f32w,1i5fagh,"I think a tough aspect, sometimes ignored by folks, is addiction. Folks can be addicted to sugar/carbs, to the sugar rush, or addicted to overeating due to emotional responses/circumstances, or even habituated to consuming this or that in certain circumstances without ever truly thinking of what they are doing. 

So some people address these addictions as one should, by going cold turkey. No one tells an alcoholic to 'use moderation' because by definition an alcoholic/addict does not adequately moderate consumption. When such a person gives the advice to just quit to someone who is not strongly addicted, just habitually or ignorantly eating what is injuring them, then it can come off as extreme advice. Especially when there are underlying health issues like gout that rear up to cause problems. 

If anything, I would like to see more posts on places like this that more directly address addictions. Someone can change to eating mostly meat, for instance, and yet show far fewer positive results than another person because they are addicted to overeating, emotional eating, binge eating, or whatever one wants to label it as being.",
m87nnsx,t1_m87i6jv,1i5fagh,"I’d also suspected the addiction aspect of it after hearing some people say that they ""just couldn’t do it"" because they missed pasta or cream and sugar in their coffee, etc., which led to eating even more sugar and carbs. These people think a calorie-restricted diet is the way for them, but it doesn’t seem very sustainable because their bodies are not properly nourished. And, when they have some negative emotions, they tend to overeat junk food again for a while until they realize they’re gaining weight or something.",
m88a7sh,t1_m87nnsx,1i5fagh,If you were a drinker also and go to meat it will do that. But if you take cherry extract daily you will be fine. Also makes it go away faster too if you have it.,

I love coffee dates anyway until things get serious enough to talk about going further. 

But I’ve also always just been pretty upfront about my lifestyle, whether it was while just keto/Paleo or full carnivore. I am a woman though, so that tends to make things easier. Most men really like a woman who can eat a big steak and not just nibble on lettuce and seeds.",

If someone had told me a few years ago they were only eating red meat, I'd have thought that was at best a bad idea health-wise (red meat bad, obv) or at worst they were weird and extreme. 

I think if you want to just ease into the topic as you get to know her, don't make a fuss in the restaurant. Maybe just order a steak and let them give you any sides that come with it (salad for e.g.) If it comes with sauce ask for it on the side.

I think I would only perceive something as weird if the guy made it weird. So, officially stop freaking out about it now. 

I would definitely start with coffee dates. If think most women prefer something casual, at the beginning anyway. You don’t need to discuss your dietary preferences on the first date. Second date, maybe a movie? Offer her popcorn/soda but tell her you’re off grains, if she asks. 

By this time, you should have an idea who she is. Some women are self-conscious, embarrass easily. And some women are neurotic and superficial. Either type could be embarrassed by a guy just eating meat. But, a lot of women will be completely ok with it. I would tell her beforehand. Order a steak. Tell her you won’t be eating your side dishes. Ask her what she likes and tell her you’ll order what she wants. 

I’m odd. I know I am. I would let you order the sides and get a to-go box of creamed spinach. Whatever you do, try not to make it a big deal. 

If you’re not ready to face it, order a side of broccoli. Chop it up and move it around. Make the excuse that it’s over cooked. Or undercooked. If she asks. But, honestly, by the third date, she’s probably into you, so if you’re casual about it, she will be too.",

When I go out my standard go to is steak, eggs & bacon… it’s probably the cleanest thing you’ll find on the menu and even then you cannot control the oil or spices the restaurant uses but it will be okay for this infrequent occurrence.  Pick a restaurant that can accommodate what you would like to eat but also has something for your date.  If the person has a problem with what and how you eat they aren’t the right person🤷🏾‍♀️🤦🏾‍♀️😅*also why is it socially acceptable to be a vegan, vegetarian, gluten free, etc but not carnivore?🤔. I’ll admit the first time I went to a meetup and afterwards the group wanted to go grab drinks I struggled with how I would play off the fact that my drinking was minimal because it tends to look a little awkward with everyone drinking it up and you seemingly looking like the stick in the mud/party pooper. lol but at the time I was on OMAD and I knew if I drank something they’d probably have to roll me out of the bar 😅 so I ordered a hot tea and everyone gave a slightly awkward look at first and I just simply said I had a few dietary restrictions at the moment and everyone was like.. “oh okay” and went back to normal banter. Funnily enough there was some religious holiday going on so I think most assumed I was doing something like that.  Also, You can always order a steak (it’ll come with fries) but you don’t have to eat the fries… she probably won’t even notice. Most restaurants will have a steak.",🤷🏾♀🤦🏾♀😅🤔😅

- a buffet (most places always have an amazing meat & seafood section, you also get your money's worth)
- Mediterranean (kabobs all day)
- Japanese or Chinese skewers restaurants 
- hot pot
- Mexican (order plates of meats)
- Cajun seafood boil places

Just to name a few 😁

Not sure if I can offer up any suggestions on what to say to somebody when out on a first date but as far as what to eat, I would simply go with the fattiest cuts of meats possible(steak, beef, pork if your body can tolerate it, fish, chicken etc..), avoid all carbs(especially desert lol😂) & all vegetables, salads etc.  I never avoid answering people when they inquire about my diet when they see me ordering or eating carnivore but I also always say to them that while I feel my best with this way of eating that I will never preach or try to dictate to others how/what they should eat. Surprisingly, many people nowadays respond quite respectfully(even if they do not follow carnivore themselves) as it is becoming increasingly popular thanx to great Dr advocates such as Dr Shawn Baker, Dr Anthony Chaffee, Dr Ken Berry that are very easily found on social media youtube etc. Best of luck & God bless you in your quest for optimal health via the proper human diet🙏",✌😂🙏

m5ippdq,t1_m5iopx6,1htfdez,"""Your larger muscles will become insulin resistant and refuse glucose...""

Kinda true. When you’re in ketosis and eating almost no carbs, your muscles take up less glucose. This is because your body wants to save what little glucose it has for cells that need it, like red blood cells or parts of your brain.

But this isn’t the same as insulin resistance in a bad way. Pathological insulin resistance (like in diabetes) is when cells can’t respond to insulin properly, leading to high blood sugar. In ketosis, it’s just your body being smart and adapting, not a health issue.


""You can reduce protein consumption to limit gluconeogenesis...""

Sort of, but not really how it works. Gluconeogenesis (making glucose from stuff like protein) ramps up when you’re eating super low-carb. Cutting back on protein might reduce the glucose your body produces, but here’s the kicker: your body only makes as much glucose as it actually needs.

So even if you eat less protein, your body’s like, “Hey, I still need some glucose,” and it’ll just make it anyway.



""The volume of glucose is de minimis compared to when you consume carbohydrates.""

Yeah, this one’s true. When you’re not eating carbs, the amount of glucose in your system is way lower compared to a carb-heavy diet. Most of your energy comes from ketones instead, so your glucose needs drop a ton.



 ""You will not have lactate-burn in your muscles from exercise, because lactate is only produced through the burning of glycogen.""

Nope, not true. Lactate (aka the burn you feel during intense exercise) comes from anaerobic glycolysis. This happens when your muscles need energy fast and don’t have enough oxygen. Even in ketosis, your muscles can still use glycogen when needed, and that means they can still produce lactate.

Glycogen stores are lower when you’re keto, sure, but they’re not gone. So yeah, you can still get that lactate burn during a hard workout.



""By limiting carbohydrate consumption you deprive cancer and viruses that use the glucose cycle of fuel.""

This one’s kind of overhyped. It’s true that cancer cells often use a lot of glucose (look up the Warburg effect), and there’s research into whether keto diets could help in some cancer treatments. But it’s not a magic fix—many cancer cells can adapt and use other fuels like fats or ketones.


As for viruses? Nah. Viruses don’t eat glucose directly. They hijack your cells and use whatever energy source the cell has—glucose, fats, ketones, whatever—to replicate. Cutting carbs isn’t gonna “starve” a virus.",

I don’t recommend the ribeye, but the others are superb! They have milk, cheese, cream, yogurt and kefir. Yum! I’m in Ohio, and next door is PA.

ROASTED TURKEY THIGHS (Carnivore meal)

PREP:

If thighs are frozen, thaw in fridge for 2 days prior to cooking. Remove thighs from fridge and bring them to room temperature. Season with salt, pepper, or other favorite seasonings you want. (Optional: rub butter or ghee under skin to add fat. Make a ""pocket"" for butter or ghee by carefully running your fingers between the skin and the meat, being careful not to tear it or remove it from the meat completely.)

Preheat oven to 400°F (or 205°C). Wrap each thigh with 3-4 strips of uncured sugar-free nitrate/nitrite-free bacon. (Optional: use toothpicks or oven-safe pop-up pegs to secure bacon to thighs if they're too short to completely wrap around the thighs.) Place them uncovered in a baking dish or roaster. *\*See NOTES below*.

OVEN:

Roast for 30 minutes, then reduce the temperature to 325°F (165℃). Continue roasting until an instant-read thermometer registers between 165°F (75℃) and 175°F (79.4°C) in the thickest part of the thigh - about an hour, depending on the size of the thighs. If you don't have a thermometer, stick a fork in a thick part of the thigh...if the juices run clear, it's done. If they're browning too fast, tent with foil or roaster lid.

Remove from the oven and let sit for 10-15 minutes before carving. That allows juices to settle into the meat. Reserve any drippings to pour over the cooked meat, or to make your favorite carnivore gravy if desired.

NOTES:

The 2 thighs I used for this dish weighed 1.2lb apiece. I wrapped 4 slices of thick bacon around each; they were long enough to totally wrap each thigh without needing to secure them with toothpicks. I placed them uncovered in a roasting pan lined with foil.

m02bz9f,t1_lztonxn,1h3uhxt,For the past couple of years I’ve been breaking my turkey down to cook it. Either spatchcocking the bird or breaking it down completely and  cooking the thigh leg combo in duck fat. This year I did the breast sous vide so it was not dry but no crispy skin on that. I seared the breast after cooking and it was tasty. I might try doing the same thing with the legs next year.  Cooking everything in fat is key.,

I’d never even run a marathon before this so it was pretty daunting. I also didn’t expect temperatures to hit 39 degrees C during the week of my runs.

lngzz7y,t1_lnf4z1o,1fi2635,I don’t recommend doing 5 fasted marathons. It was an extreme example demonstrating the enormity of energy we have available when we are fat adapted. It then makes ‘having enough energy to get through until lunchtime’ seem pretty trivial. That was the point,

lnhuuqy,t1_lnh0z7i,1fi2635,I eat plenty of butter and some cheese. Personally I avoid milk because it spikes my blood sugar. I’ve tested this repeatedly. Maintaining low blood sugar and reducing insulin spikes is what makes my metabolism fat adapted.,

lnimt27,t1_lnimewg,1fi2635,Of course not! I’m an ordinary bloke that had never run a marathon before and did 5 in a row during a 5 day fast. Being fat adapted unlocks enormous amounts of energy but it doesn’t turn an ordinary guy into the best athlete in the world. 😂,😂
lnmio0l,t1_lnlkiii,1fi2635,Fasting isn’t the focus. This was an experiment to demonstrate the enormous reserves of energy we can all access from existing body fat when we become fat adapted. Fasting was required to ensure that there was no possibility that my energy came from any exogenous source.,
lo4i54q,t1_lnv3kun,1fi2635,I expect it will be the case eventually. Personally I don’t plan my fasts. I simply eat when I’m hungry and stop eating when it stops tasting good. Over time this naturally became 1-2 meals a day. Some days I don’t eat because I’m not hungry. I’ve been keto for more than a decade prior to carnivore and it wasn’t until I went carnivore 5 years ago that my satiety really went to the next level. I’d also say that it happened gradually over a couple of years.,

lnhwndy,t1_lngxiqi,1fi2635,"Correct. It’s not fast at all - for a single marathon. I set out to complete not only the distance of 211km but to extend it over a 5 day period which adds additional energy requirements due maintaining resting metabolic rates. 

A couple of factors to consider:
- I’d never run a marathon before
- no one in the world has ever recorded 5 marathons in 5 days fasted
- everyone told me I would die attempting to do it.
- it was between 33-39 degree C every day of my marathons
- I had 2 sprained ankles for my last 2 marathons.

loceyzp,t1_lnjkk3t,1fi2635,I’d never run a marathon before this. My first ever marathon was the first of these 5 and it had been a decade since I’d run at all. I simply chose to run marathons as I needed an activity that would require an exceptionally large physical demand as the entire goal was to test out if being fat adapted really does provide a huge amount of energy. I can now definitively say that it does.,

locgoa4,t1_lo5mhim,1fi2635,Will do. Thanks. I’m still figuring out how reddit works,
logmkmr,t1_logjrfu,1fi2635,These days I eat 1-2 meals per day. Usually 1kg tbone for dinner. Lunch might be 4 hamburger Pattie’s with cheese or a 6-8 egg omelette,
lnf4ua4,t1_lnf2mpi,1fi2635,"Fat is very dense. 3500 calories per pound. 100 calories per mile @ 26 miles is about 2600 calories.

So he probably lost under 1 pound per marathon. But that's not including resting the rest of the day...

Anyway, the pic of him is at the end I imagine?

Either way, do you really think our ancestors when they were that lean as him and could not get food just rolled over and died? No... more energy is mobilised for hunting...

It's really obvious when you think of it from a hunter gatherer perspective. Of course we needed the *most* energy while fasted, especially across multiple days.

When I was doing keto back in the day I was working as a plumber full time, I ended up doing multi-day fasts while working. Which is 8hr+ heavy labour job. I had the most energy fasted than I did at any other time in my entire career.",
lnezqb3,t1_lnezedi,1fi2635,"It's was well know that fat was way better at giving us energy, because you need less of it to have more. If I'm not mistaken, 1g of fat has the same energy of 4g of carbohydrates. So you only need to eat 1/4 to get the same amount.",
lngnq0f,t1_lnf4ua4,1fi2635,This was precisely my thinking. Evolutionarily all of our ancestors would have hunted in a fasted state. No one would eat prior so they had energy to hunt! This evolutionary concept was what game me confidence to even attempt it. Believe me when I say that everyone told me I’d die about halfway through!,
lnf6x2t,t1_lnf4ua4,1fi2635,"I’m with you but struggle why eating nuts, plants, and fruits get hate.  Not knocking the diet just learning to process it",

I do struggle with some of the theory to be honest.  I don’t know why eating nuts is bad.  If I have more than a few if I’m cheating it kills my stomach.  They just seem so natural",
lnjase2,t1_lnf6x2t,1fi2635,"Plants are living beings. They do not like to be eaten. Because they can't run away or fight back, they defend themselves with chemicals. 
 
Many plants will kill You outright if You eat them unprocessed. Most plants will at the very least make You very, very sick. When processed, the toxins and antinutrients within them can be removed to some degree, but never fully. Those toxins accumulate over time and are responsible for a host of known problems like oxalates-> arthritis or lectins -> leaky gut, and probably many more that are unknown or yet unproven. 


Pretty much all plants contain some kind of carbohydrate, all of which (with the exception of fructose and galactose IIRC) are converted to glucose. Excess glucose in the bloodstream is toxic to the cells. Diabetes is just chronically highly elevated blood glucose levels. Having a slightly lower elevated glucose constantly is still harmful, it just takes more time to see the damage. Fructose, on the other hand, glycates the cells much more rapidly and is causally connected to non-alcoholic fatty liver disease. And don't get me started on fiber...


We don't just ""hate plants"". I am very unhappy that I shouldn't have my potatoes, fruit or even stuff like broccoli which I actually find rather tasty. I just recognize that they are not appropriate sources of nutrition. ",

lzx3gdq,t3_1h458se,1h458se,My daughter turned vegan at 13. (When she got a phone and went on reddit). Lived like that for 15 years.

m0112gw,t3_1h458se,1h458se,"One thing I don’t hear in vegan and vegetarian justification is the historical or Palaeolithic explanation for how they ate, survived, thrived and evolved that way. The human body does not evolve quickly enough to explain how people can live on plants only. How did that work in Canada throughout winters thousands of years ago ? One of the reasons we are suffering from ultra processed food is because humans have only eaten it daily since the 80s. That’s why people over 50 are scratching their heads trying to figure out why almost everyone is morbidly obese, pale and puffy all of a sudden. Look at phots from the sixties. If a human sits or lays down 22 hrs a day and eats copy written industrial food product out of a box- they slowly die from malnutrition.",

A human can’t thrive or even survive in a healthy state on a vegan diet unless they use supplementation, which obviously would not have been an option historically. 

And to say the human body “PREFERS GLUCOSE”??????? Where are you coming up with this? 😂😂😂😂

So far I see some people thriving, and some people miserably exhausted, constipated, dehydrated AF and having heart issues.

High consumption of animal protein sources, especially red meat, results in an increased intake of saturated fat, cholesterol, iron, and salt, as well as an excessive acid load. Red meat intake may lead to an elevated production of uremic toxins by the gut microbiota, such as trimethylamine n-oxide (TMAO), indoxyl sulfate, and p-cresyl sulfate which are associated with increased risk for cardiovascular (CV) mortality. 
- Limiting the intake of red meat in patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD) thus may be a good strategy to reduce CV risk, and may slow the progression of kidney disease.

>And yet you see tons of testimonials from people here and elsewhere that going carnivore resolved their inflammation, caused them to shed a lot of bodyfat, increased their general energy and libido, increased their mental focus and acuity, etc...

you have to look at what caused them to have those issues in the first place. Were they eating excessive processed foods to begin with? Its found that almost all of these people have a bad relationship with food and  were eating a lot of sugary (too much) and processed foods, living a sedentary lifestyle, not doing any type of physical activities at all.

studies were done where they took healthy individuals and replaced all meat with vegetables keeping same nutritional value of their diet and it didn't affect them at all.

  
>So if fatty red meat is actually bad for you, how could it have so many positive effects?

It has positive effects because people who stopped eating everything but meat have cut all unhealthy processed sugary stuff from their diet, replaced it with meat, which is good change and will help them to in short term. Fats in meat gives dopamine boost, so people can stick to it. Veggies have no fats in them so its really hard to stick to them, if you don't know how to cook them and make them tastier.

so why red meat is bad ? One of the reason is high amount of saturated fat in it, which increases LDL in blood, which causes the build-up of **plaque** in the arteries, causes arteries to get blocked which increases load on heart, which leads to cardiac arrest. But this build-up takes time and it takes time.  
  - Once you get heart attack, doctors will ask u to cut down on all types of red meat altogether, this is from an actual patient (my friend's father). 

  
>And why would it be one of the most natural and plentiful food sources?

Again, use your own logic, if meat was plentiful then why meat industry is injecting the animals with steroids, growth hormones, various derivatives of estrogen and testosterone etc..

>Animals have existed as long as humans have.

So have plants.",
l45wktf,t1_l44f85v,1clz2ti,"I was eating healthy before going carnivore. I was very light on the sugary snacks and sodas. My meals were usually a homemade burrito bowl of rice, 90% lean ground beef with taco seasoning, minced salad mix, shredded cheddar cheese. I didn't often have fast food, just once in awhile. Even still, I would feel bloating from my meals. Also had mild IBS-like symptoms. After switching to carnivore, the bloat went away and my digestive and bowel processes are normal. So I don't think it's simply about cutting sweets, there is definitely something wrong with crop-based foods that is making people sick.

About the supposed artery issues with red meats, I don't have enough counter evidence at the moment for that. I'll do some more research into it. I know there are long term carnivores that are doing just fine though.

One more point about plants. Let's just look at this from a food density perspective. Plants are mostly water and cellulose. You produce more waste when you eat plants because of that insoluble fiber. I would argue that meat and fat are much more nutritionally dense than plants. Meat also has a lot of water, but has more digestible material than plants, and has less extraneous components that can cause miscellaneous effects or sensitivities in people.",
l49eb5a,t1_l45wktf,1clz2ti,">...there is definitely something wrong with crop-based foods that is making people sick.

I agree with you, there are genetically modified crops out there and extensive use of pesticides etc, this can cause problems. But the feed used for animals in meat industry is the worst (good part + bad part); good part is protein source, Fats, grains, vitamin sources, fiber sources; but the BAD part is additives they add to that such as, Antibiotics, Enzymes (to help break down feed components...), growth promoters {I have covered all this is link I provided above}.

The real problem is **Bio-accumulation** and **Bio-magnification**.

Bio-accumulation is build-up of all these chemicals __(antibodies, hormones, pesticides, herbicides & heavy metals such as lead, mercury and arsenic)__ in animal muscle tissue and fat over time. 
Bio-magnification is the process where the concentration of these chemicals increases as they move up the food chain. For example cow eats contaminated or chemically engineered feed, these chemicals gets concentrated in its meat and fat, then humans eats beef and these concentrated chemicals gets passed in humans which can seriously harm gut microbes, can cause antibiotic resistance or hormonal imbalance etc., Imagine a pregnent lady eats this meat, what kindof impact is going to be on her child.
But no-one seems to talk about this, industry will never tell you this, they have to make profit.

I came across an article which said people growing their own vegetables in their garden causes 4 times increase in greenhouse gases...this simply means agricultural industries don't want u to grow your own veggies, rather they want you to buy their produce.

If you have to have meat, try limiting red meat to 500grams per week(cooked) and try other white meats instead or don't cut vegetables all together. Eat a balanced diet, if possible. Cut processed and packaged stuff altogether, as it's artificially made more palatable.

>About the supposed artery issues with red meats, I don't have enough counter evidence at the moment for that. I'll do some more research into it. I know there are long term carnivores that are doing just fine though.

It's not just red meat, saturated fats are in higher amounts in all animal products and processed plant based products as well like palm oil; When the plaque(causes arteries to choke) was tested, it composed of fats, cholestrol, calcium etc.

And yes, you should do your research, but not just to give counter evidence. Rather use it to make good descisions.

>Plants are mostly water and cellulose.

Cellulose is a component of dietary fiber and it's just one part of broader nutritional profile of vegitarian diet. 
1. Micronutrients: 
    - proteins(legumes, nuts, seeds etc), 
    - carbs(whole grains, veggies, fruits, legumes; these r complex carbs which r good)
    - fats(nuts, seeds etc)
2. Micronutrients: VITAMINS(veggies, fruits esp citrus fruits) and MINERALS(calcium, magnesium, iron etc)
3. Fiber: (aids in digestion and heart health)
4. Phyto nutrients and Anti-oxidants: reduces risk of chronic disease.
Etc etc... but you have to have a variety of plant based diet, and not just one thing because no single plant based food has all essential amino acids.

>You produce more waste when you eat plants because of that insoluble fiber.

I guess, but if your point is that we r pooping more and thus harming environment more, people have been pooping for ever, the bad descision was to throw that poop in water and contaminating water. Although, poop is biodegradable.
But, meat industry harms enviornment more adversely, I have data on this. 
For example: 1 kg of beef production causes 99.48kgs of greenhouse gas emissions, while 1 kg of nuts, potatoes, Bananas, peas, wheat, rye, Maize and rice put together causes 10.45 kg of greenhouse gas emissions.

Also, production of 1 kg of protein from beef needs 18 times more land, 10 times more water, 9 times more fuel, 12 times more fertilizers, and 10 times more pesticides for the same amount of protein obtained from kidney beans.

>I would argue that meat and fat are much more nutritionally dense than plants.

I would say you might be right here, if you compare just meat and plant on face value. But if you look at all the stuff went into making that meat, I would argue that for a given amount of resource, you can produce far more nutrition from plant based food.

>...sensitivities in people.

In most cases, it's not the plant based food itself, rather the chemicals that r used in them which cause these sensitivities. And some plant food may have some sort of sensitivity to some people, so they should just stop that particular plant food. Like my mother can't have eggplant, it makes her feet to swell a bit, so she doesn't eat it.",

Yes the animals are often given low-quality food and/or chemicals to make them grow faster. However, cows and lambs are ruminants and so there's at least an extra layer of digestion that helps separate the nutrients in the food from the waste and somewhat protects the meat. It's not a full or ideal solution, but it is better than plants which directly absorb energy in order to grow and would more readily transfer toxins when consumed.

I agree to the first line only, but every random person doesn't even understand diet and what it is; most people don't even know what a balanced diet is ? 
It's worth listening but it's not that valuable as you don't know what that person's lifestyle is, what that person's history with food has been etc etc...
 - but if you look at the healthiest group of people, who live the longest i.e., Okinawans from Japan, none of them only ate meat. Their diet is rich in vegetables, tofu, sweet potato, fish and very limited meat consumption. 
 - Sardinians from Italy or Ikarians from Greece etc etc....__none of them only ate meat__. All of these people have very low rates chronic diseases and their diet is rich in vegetarian foods.

Btw one of the most unhealthy people live in USA because they are being lied to constantly, American diet is high in processed foods, sugars, and unhealthy fats that is why switching to only meat will show some benefits in short term only. It's gonna have a way worse effects. Most Americans buy meat off of a shelf, either frozen or something....that packaged meat is processed meat.

>...but I can give you sources that say it's exactly the OPPOSITE, that CO2 emissions are actually promoting plant growth around the world and is not bad for the atmosphere. 

This would be an example of biased study, and they misrepresent data using persentage, i.e., small increase in CO2 percentage is a huge increase when seen in absolute terms.  CO2 traps the heat from sun within the earth's atmosphere and doesn't let it escape, thus heating the atmosphere. Read about Marshall Islands, which is sinking because of this. Also, plants were thriving before humans started to pump greenhouse gases in atmosphere, so tht argument tht it helps promote plant growth is absolute BS, and a lot of experts/scientists have called this BS out already.

For the sake of argument, let's don't look at CO2 emissions. What about the __resources__ that it takes to raise these animals for food and it's not the best quality (filled with chemicals*)


>However, cows and lambs are ruminants and so there's at least an extra layer of digestion that helps separate the nutrients in the food from the waste and somewhat protects the meat.

Ruminant means ""re-chewing"" of food, which is a digestion process and has nothing to do with ""saving the meat"". These animals would quickly graze over a field and stuff themselves so that later on they can re-chew that food where they were safer from predators, it's all evolution. Please read about __biomagnification__ and __bioaccumulation__, to better understand how chemicals gets concentrated over time in their fats and meats that they get from their chemically engineered feed.

Btw I also used to eat a lot of meat, but have cut down on it heavily, I had no adverse effect whatsoever, sometimes I go weeks without eating any meat, but I come back to it because I miss the taste. Also, I eat plain yogurt almost everyday, which I make for myself. One thing that I noticed is, it takes less than 5 mins to pass stool every morning and it doesn't smell bad.",

But I can’t for the life of me understand how I could possibly do a Monday-Friday water fast when I can barely make it to 4pm daily.

m18t0w5,t1_m18oqqy,1hab0y3,"I had been fasting 16/8 regularly for months. When I finished my first five day fast, daily fasting was much easier and when eating carnivore aka not eating carbs , I do not really crave sugars or carbs - which just make you hungrier. I also don’t have a huge appetite when eating carnivore. 


After finishing the 5 day fast it was easy to fast 18 to 20 hours a day. I started an AM/PM supplement plan though so I was forcing myself to eat two meals or a snack and dinner, even though I wasn’t hungry. I had to take the supplements with food. This went on for about a month. Thanksgiving came and I ate cake. I said I would get right back in carnivore but I ate cake, candy and pizza for the next three days. I said no, absolutely not, I’m putting myself on a fast to not only use up all the newly stored glucose out of my body but to get my flesh under control. I aimed for a minimum of 5 days and ended up doing the 7. I had moments of hunger from day 5 - 7 but nothing that lasted more than a few minutes. I believe because I was truly nourishing my body, fasting was easier. 

But that initial 5 day fast was when I had noticed big changes as far as appetite and simplicity in daily fasting.  Here’s the thing, I’m a stay at home wife. When I say I was IN BED unless I was puking bile and water from being so nauseous, I mean it. For 4.5 days!!! My husband totally supported me and encouraged me to take it easy. I did meal prep for him before starting - all meals! I know not everybody has the luxury be sick a week. I’m grateful. That time really was a turning point.

  I suggest, if you’re interested in implementing fasting, to start slow. Do 12 hours for a week. Then do 13 hours for a week. Then do 14 hours for a week. So on and so forth until a weekly 24 hour or maybe OMAD. Whatever is right for you, when it’s right for you - I fast for healing now, not weight loss anymore. 

 If you eat or drink dairy it might be an idea to experiment without as that may be sparking hunger signals for you. Or maybe there’s something else you’re consuming. How long have you been strict carnivore? Are you familiar with the “priming” process? 


 And , as a Christian, I must say I take all of my decisions before the Lord. I pray for next steps, what’s right for me at this time etc etc and I do wait to make moves until I receive guidance or Holy nudges. I had to remove all vanity and selfish ambition out of my health journey intentions and the “whys” that drive our goals and decisions. 

 Congratulations on your success so far!",
m17f0th,t1_m17b179,1hab0y3,"I’m just beginning! I finished a 7 day water fast last night, did a steak and egg refeed and now (Monday) starting with the weekday fasting and weekend refeed schedule.  

 The 7 day fast was honestly easy, which I wasn’t expecting as I was MISERABLE during an Oct 5 day fast - seriously sick as a dog , and I barely made it through a 3 day fast in November. Because the 7 day was easy, I kept contemplating extending it. Instead I decided to eat and the jump into the schedule mentioned. 


 I have noticed a big decrease in migraines over the last couple of weeks, but I also started a new supplement that pretty much soaks up histamine in your body.  I will do my best to pay extra attention and share at the end up of the month what I noticed.


 My goal right now is to bring forth a sugar free child. I’ve been trying to conceive for five years, and throughout this year the responsibility of generational health has been put on my heart.  I’m doing my best to remain sugar free before pregnancy, during pregnancy and while breastfeeding. It’s a big goal with an unknown timeline.  

 Carnivore helps me sooooooo much with sugar cravings (I count all carbs as sugar) as well and my mental and emotional health.  I’m at the beginning of this lifestyle and I’m so encouraged and excited to keep going. ",

m1cln82,t1_m1b68ed,1hab0y3,Thank you. Sometimes we don’t see the change happening slowly in front of us. I was feeling a little stagnant when I decided to do a side by side. I found confirmation and great motivation in the difference. ,
m1cl9a0,t1_m1bycoh,1hab0y3,"Thank you - I feel great!  

 I just drink water . Sometimes I’ll throw a 1/4 tsp and salt in my mouth and chug a bunch of water (I don’t like to add it to my water but it the popular route)  

 is just eating again lol - refueling the system. I think the term is used often when it comes to rolling fasts .. for example rolling 48’s is when you fast for 48 hours, refeed (eat) and immediately go back into a 48 hour fast. 


Edit: I just seen you asked what does the fast do. I’m not the best with my words but I do it for to give my body an opportunity to heal itself on a cellular level… which happens after not eating . Different things are happening at different times like 16 hours, 24 hours, 48, 72 a etc etc etc .. I would encourage you to research the benefits of extending fasting / water fasting / intermittent fasting and definitely learn about autophagy. 

I also fast to bring my flesh under control . ",

m1ckdd6,t1_m19noj2,1hab0y3,"Carnivore and Coach Raymond Nazon - look up his priming protocol. I am sure YT has a decent amount of info. To summarize you spend 2 to 3 weeks eating 3 meals plus snacks - carnivore. I’m sure as clean as you can get - so meat and eggs over pork rinds kind of things. After priming, you’re packed full of nutrients… I wouldn’t be surprised if you settle into a fasting schedule after that. Some people prime for just a week, some for months. But he suggests the 2 to 3 weeks. 


Edit to add: I don’t think I have to say it, but get that fat in. A slice of butter is a snack and can usually complete that “hand to mouth” muscle memory that satisfies the brain when  we have a feeling of WANTING to eat (versus needing to eat)

This is one reason why when quitting smoking, a lot of people try suckers/lollipops.. as their brain is used to holding the cigarette and bringing it to the mouth..",

I thought I'll put some notes:

-I am working out everyday, lifting weights, body-weight calisthenics and cardio - mostly MTB/Gravel and road cycling - to my HUGE surprise, after some adjustments my strength AND cardio is THE SAME, after a couple of weeks I've started getting exactly the SAME ""pump"" at the gym etc as on carbs.

-Cardio-wise - it is ""kinda harder"" to sprint, BUT - the overall average speed/pace etc is THE SAME as on the carb diet (overall even improved -  because I became lighter).

-I've went full carnivore because of severe acne on my forehead which has TOTALLY disappeared after  just TWO weeks into carnivore.

-I had some serious bloating/gas problems - GONE, 0 stomach pains, 0 gas/bloating, ZERO.

-The simplicity of NOT buying ""hundreds"" of different groceries, NOT making long lists etc, but just going into a store, grabbing some eggs, beef, and butter and that's it - is LIBERATING and addicting in a great way.

-The ease of food prep - no more cutting salads, no more boiling different types of grains, putting it into different boxes, sorting it all inside the fridge and making the dishwasher work extra hours.

-Don't get it wrong, you  can overshoot it with butter and even eggs and gain fat EASILY. BUT, but compared to ""regular carbs and veggies based eating"" - it is WAY easier to stay satiated with no sugar ""ups and downs"".

-The LACK of other food IS WHAT MAKES IT EASY: by knowing that I eat NOTHING except beef,butter,eggs and cheese - I simply don't buy any other type of food, and by this, even if I do have a craving somewhere before my bedtime and I'll open up the fridge - what would I snack on? Butter again? :D",

""Pre Workout"" meal - Bulletproof coffee (30gr. of butter blended in black coffee)

Meal #3 - You'd never guess..... 200gr. fried ground beef with 10gr. butter!

lsmhiy3,t1_lsm0tpm,1g6r4b3,"100% agree, people in here talking about gorging themselves on butter and heavy cream like calories dont matter at all. Your body has a base metabaloic rate with caloric needs so determined. If you want to lose weight you have to eat under that limit. If you're doing a 5k calorie meal you arent gonna lose weight. If you get a 20oz heavy cream latte at the beginning of the day, you probably have zero wiggle room left unless you're a super active body builder. Everything in moderation, intermittent fasting to lower insulin resistance, and regular labs to monitor health.",
lsn2ys9,t1_lsm0tpm,1g6r4b3,I like your first paragraph. Your second is a bit condescending. I’m fully aware of how nutrition and physiology work. Nor did I claim that I am gorging or even anything close.,

Pretty good intensity. I still struggle with getting enough protein. Carnivore sounds like a great way to fix that. You miss pasta and sweets? Any cheating at all on your part? Great job to you 👍😎,👍😎

Thank you!",
lslobdb,t1_lsllxc2,1g6r4b3,"No no no, I did not stay off 😂😂 what happened was I had two kids. Got right back on it. I’m essentially projecting to you, with a little bit of first hand experience. 

But boy did the caffeine save my ass after a few sleepless nights with the little one. Unfortunately the benefit is diminishing. It only saved me because I had no tolerance. 

The shelf life of caffeine is 12 hours. So if you have 200 mg at noon, by midnight in your sleep you’ll have 100mg of caffeine coursing thru your veins. 

Over time, it doesn’t actually make it harder to fall asleep. It seems instead that prevents us from reaching deeper states of sleep. Deeper states of sleep is where true healing and cell recycling happens. 

I think to, many ppl have different baseline tolerances based on genetics. 

Although I’m failing at my own advice, I find it beneficial to finish your coffee for the day in early morning. 

Over time, add decaf to your regular coffee and just experiment with slightly lower doses of caffeine. Less is more no matter where you are on the spectrum",😂😂

Initially I tried this for gut issues and chronic back pain, which are both gone

But also went from ~12%bf to ~8%bf in a matter of 4 months, all whilst eating ~4000cals a day (340g fat, 245g prot, 30g carb)

Back then on a “normal” diet I couldn’t get leaner even on 2000cals, I was just losing muscle mass

lsv8zv8,t1_lsuar5o,1g6r4b3,"I know but it correlates with the amount of carbs you ingest, so by restricting calories you restrict the amount of carbs. It’s nonsense but still can help people lose weight on a high carb diet.",
lsod2r3,t1_lsoclpw,1g6r4b3,"It means eating massive quantities of meat & eggs. Like over 5000 calories/day for 1 or more weeks.

I don't want to misrepresent anything, but I'm 10% sure it means to ""heal the body and let your body become enriched enough to potentiate maximum future fat-burning"" and I think the argument is that priming will speed up future weight loss. And that it is especially important for people like Todd (Carnivore Cure) who aim to lose more than 100 pounds. But for losing less than 30 pounds, priming is advised against.",

llju678,t1_llh3ii4,1f8u4xq,"Yea, bros's killing it!",
llj381j,t1_llhp24v,1f8u4xq,I’m going to do this diet too to hopefully heal autoimmune shit.  Where did you seek your guidance on how to start and what to eat??,
llixp5n,t1_llhku8r,1f8u4xq,Great fucking job mate,
llhbuqs,t1_llh9ew4,1f8u4xq,I 100% agree. Watching older films and stuff you see just how much unhealthiest we all are now as a society.,
llh8hia,t1_llh72oj,1f8u4xq,"I just eat the same 16 oz ribeye, 6 eggs, 3 pieces of bacon and lots of butter scrambled into the eggs with the bacon grease. I only eat once in the evening everyday. I was walking a lot in the beginning but this is pretty much just the diet. Lost about 10 lbs a month. I'm about to start working out to put on about 10 lbs muscle. I stopped drinking cold turkey but with the help of my doctor for meds. I was drinking almost a liter a day of vodka.",
llhk2kq,t1_llhgaun,1f8u4xq,Yeah all the time!,
llj0ik5,t1_llizmkd,1f8u4xq,Thank you!,
lljx54j,t1_lljwla9,1f8u4xq,Feel like one man! The clarity is real!,
llhk61n,t1_llhfpao,1f8u4xq,3 months is where it really starts kicking in. Keep it up man!,
llifgur,t1_lli8htj,1f8u4xq,"Honestly I was so sick and needing to be sober that I saw results so fast it wasn't hard. It felt so unusual feeling healthy I had forgotten what it felt like. But the anxiety melted away with the lbs. I just made my mind up and did it. Dropped alcohol, carbs, sugar, amd nicotine on the same day and never looked back.",
lliektf,t1_lli9vpe,1f8u4xq,I have some strong will power I guess cuz I quit dipping the same day no more nicotine. But carnivore helped immensely. I wouldn't have been able to do it without it. I went to rehab once and the 12 steps weren't for me. What's funny is I'm a bartender and have absolutely no desire to drink again. And I still love my job. Haven't had a drop in over 200 days. BP was 175/110 and is now 115/70  sometimes a little lower without meds! And I use way more salt now. This diet honestly changed my life.,
lliqzam,t1_lliqmwk,1f8u4xq,You got it man! It works I swear. I was at the worst. I'm about to do a heavy 3 month workout program. Going for spiderman physique!,
llkygod,t1_llklq0i,1f8u4xq,The way I look at it and it made it real simple for me was. I wanted to put what was best for me into my body. I mean why wouldn't I? Why would I wanna poison myself on purpose when it's so simple. And it just clicked.,
lln7dno,t1_llmhhwl,1f8u4xq,Just walked. And did some lifting at the beginning but mostly walked 4 miles every other day for like 2 months. Haven't been walking in a while though. It got real hot here. Gonna hit the gym soon. Excited to bulk up,
llntlf6,t1_llnjuoa,1f8u4xq,Your body is getting to fully utilize what you are putting in it. It isn't wasting energy trying to go through toxins and fiber. I eat less calories than I use to. It's basically just optimizing yourself. It's simple. Eat when hungry. Just make it meat. And your good.,
llo0jxf,t1_llnz0f0,1f8u4xq,I hit 170 and than 15 more lbs fell off lol,
llovbv6,t1_llov5r9,1f8u4xq,Can't do sprints. Have a knee replacement.,
llif34g,t1_lli99hj,1f8u4xq,"One 16oz ribeye, 6 large eggs scrambled in bacon grease and lots of butter, and 3 pieces of bacon once a day around 6pm. Sometimes 4 1/3 waigu burger patties with a little cheese instead of the steak. No exercise needed. I was walking at first a lot but haven't in months.",
llipons,t1_llip7sr,1f8u4xq,"I've put this in response to a few other comments, but it's 1 16oz grassfed robeye, 6 large eggs scrambled in bacon grease and butter, and 3 or 4 pieces of no sugar bacon. Once a day around 6pm",
llkx1tb,t1_llkeryr,1f8u4xq,Just don't use sugar,
llpdt4f,t1_llp59ti,1f8u4xq,Nah omad was super simple. And with what I ate it satiated me to where I wasn't hungry for a day.,
llsjbqe,t1_llrq01a,1f8u4xq,Cuz I don't have a drunk smile lol,
llir3tr,t1_llhc6y5,1f8u4xq,"Butter, butter, and more butter. Grab some eggs and scramble them with some butter and down them. Also grab some electrolyte water from Trader Joes. You’re probably feeling sick from the lack of electrolytes. Also this diet is a detox from a lot of bad shit that our body gets addicted to and it will take a few days to adjust but please hang in there, I swear it’s worth it!",
lllbu7f,t1_llhc6y5,1f8u4xq,"I drink coffee with 50-100g of butter each cup really creamy and nice , salted butter is the best . Then I consume my proteins later in the day .",
llp4747,t1_llhsdaq,1f8u4xq,Tbh he would had got the same results on any cleaning eating lifestyle. I stopping eating junk food and drinking a litre of vodka a day is going to bring big changes.,
llj42vc,t1_llj381j,1f8u4xq,"Youtube. Just did research. Ken Berry, Anthony chaffee, homestead how.",
llju7ab,t1_llj381j,1f8u4xq,Auto immune issues here as well. And just had a horrible diverticulitis flare. I'm done. I don't wanna live like this anymore. Carnivore it is!!,
llixnzu,t1_llhbuqs,1f8u4xq,I saw one of myself last night at .. god I don’t even know how big. But I knew I was sucking in in the video.. I looked like a fat asshole. Someone who didn’t care an iota about life (which is further than the truth). It was nice to see.. and remind me of the “why”,
llhpafs,t1_llh8hia,1f8u4xq,Liter a day?! How are you alive?,
llhqgcd,t1_llh8hia,1f8u4xq,One meal a day ?,
llkc830,t1_llh8hia,1f8u4xq,"So you only eat a 16oz ribeye, 6 eggs and 3 strips of bacon for the whole day every day... 7 months.",
llqibwj,t1_llifgur,1f8u4xq,Damn that is amazing. That is something to be very proud of.,
llig8mi,t1_lliektf,1f8u4xq,"Unfortunately, 12 step recovery and rehab are synonymous but should not be. I was not able to get sober until I went to a treatment center that uses evidence-based treatment and therapies. 12 step recovery is not evidence based and has less than a 5% success rate. I just feel compelled to mention this in case you’re ever talking to someone who is not able to do what you did. Encourage them to find evidence based addiction treatment. Either way, I’m immensely proud of you and I hope you are proud of yourself as well.",
llin9l8,t1_lliektf,1f8u4xq,"How tall are you, OP?",
llis8vo,t1_lliqzam,1f8u4xq,"I’m trying to get back into the gym and swimming but my energy levels aren’t fully where I want them so I just do two hour long walks per day with my dogs! But dude, you are so appreciated for showing this. To look like your after picture would make my life complete. I hate my stupid dad bod stomach. I want a flat stomach and I want to look good naked haha",
llo0xw4,t1_llntlf6,1f8u4xq,"I’ve been on Carnivore 2 weeks, and so far so good. Thank you for the explanation. I only eat one meal a day and find myself not hungry anymore. Taking electrolytes, and I haven’t had many bad side effects. Lost 5 lbs so far, which I’m sure is water weight. But hey, water weight is still weight!  I’ll take it. : )",
llo191s,t1_llo0jxf,1f8u4xq,"Haha I would actually be sad if I got to 150, I’d have to buy an all new wardrobe and I’m notoriously cheap, lol",
llovtgt,t1_llovbv6,1f8u4xq,"Oh, what ever to get ur heart up a lot then down a lot, I think it’s hiit work out these days, in college I just used to do it,

Swim maybe, 

Anyway looks great bro",
llkx401,t1_llkx1tb,1f8u4xq,No creamer either?,
llixgmv,t1_llir3tr,1f8u4xq,"I have been heavy on the eggs to make up for the lack of fats I’m getting in but I think I will throw up if I see another egg 😂 electrolytes are honestly my saviour at the moment once my energy dips, they really do help! I was on a very low fat, high protein diet prior so I know my body needs time to adjust, riding it out so I can see all the great benefits everyone else is seeing!! 🙌🏼",😂🙌🏼
llld3fw,t1_lllbu7f,1f8u4xq,"I will definitely try this once I can stomach anything but water, thank you. I’m 24 hours into a fast now and still feel sick at the thought of anything 🥹",🥹
llpxuvc,t1_llp4747,1f8u4xq,"I'm replying to HIS comment on how he did it. He should be proud. 
Anyone drinking a liter of vodka a day should prob slow it down regardless.",
lliy32p,t1_llixnzu,1f8u4xq,Amen brother,
lli9p8f,t1_llhpafs,1f8u4xq,I’m a 5’3 woman and drank that amount for a while. I did almost die of course but that was years in . It is not an abnormal amount for people with severe alcohol use disorder.,
llhsgkx,t1_llhpafs,1f8u4xq,Someone up there thinks I should stick around. I like to think I've recovered so I can help others.,
llirnpm,t1_llhqgcd,1f8u4xq,"You’ll be surprised how not hungry you become if your first meal of the day, especially after a fast, is filled with meat fats and protein. I can barely get my 2nd meal down somedays.",
llht356,t1_llhqgcd,1f8u4xq,Yeah,
llkx60h,t1_llkc830,1f8u4xq,Had a couple cheat days but it was with a no sugar keto ice cream lol full of fat. So not even much of a cheat.,
lligwf3,t1_llig8mi,1f8u4xq,"That's great to know. Thank you! Glad I posted this and am able to learn as well. I am becoming proud of myself, but now I just see it as so simple.

llinkua,t1_llin9l8,1f8u4xq,"5'8""",
llislwa,t1_llis8vo,1f8u4xq,Keep up the walking. I need to get back to it. Walked 4 miles a day in about an hour and felt great. Still feel great but the walking is good mentally to. You can do it man. Once your gut biome gets changed that other food looks like poison,
llo1h9v,t1_llo0xw4,1f8u4xq,Yeah some people have harder transitions than others. I didn't have any issues and it was pretty smooth. I think my body was just so ready to be taken care of. Worse thing I had at first was number 2 issues lol,
llo1mvm,t1_llo191s,1f8u4xq,That has been the most expensive thing throughout this. I hardly buy clothes so had to get all new stuff at 180 and again at 157,
llow7ln,t1_llovtgt,1f8u4xq,Thanks man. Yeah swimming would be good. I usually just do clean shaven now that I don't have a few chins. Just been on staycation lol,
llkxazy,t1_llkx401,1f8u4xq,I wouldn't but heavy cream is fine. Just dont use a enormous amount. Coffee might make your poop a bit different though,
llj14ed,t1_llixgmv,1f8u4xq,"Fast! You must fast on this diet or food will tire out quickly. If you are not hungry, don’t eat.",
lltkid6,t1_llld3fw,1f8u4xq,Make sure you salt your meat very generously this is how you will get your electrolytes in! I have not had the need to drink any electrolytes drinks due to this only when Iam doing hard larbor sweating all day is when I need to drink electrolytes to replenish what I have lost in sweating.,
llifms4,t1_lli9p8f,1f8u4xq,Glad you are better hun!,
lliyy5d,t1_lli9p8f,1f8u4xq,Damn. I can't even imagine consuming that amount. I guess you build tolerance,
llje5rj,t1_llhsgkx,1f8u4xq,You are helping others!  Thank you!,
llkybqz,t1_llkx60h,1f8u4xq,Right on well besides carnivore you had a substantial calorie deficit too... Congrats on success,

Makes you wonder how much other shit the powers that be are lying to us about…",
lll5982,t1_llislwa,1f8u4xq,How long does it take for the gut biome to change and digested to incorporate exercise? Thank you in advance.,
llpnuvc,t1_llo1h9v,1f8u4xq,"Haha, yes, the number 2 issues were harsh the first week. But after 2 weeks, all has calmed. It’s still not like it used to be, but so much better than the beginning. Thanks again.",

lll4hva,t1_llkybqz,1f8u4xq,Just counted up the calories for that. It's at 1980 so just about perfect for me.,
lliu6ux,t1_llit2x6,1f8u4xq,Yes it does. I'm trying to do my best to help others out there now and figured this was one of the best ways to reach people and show them it's easily attainable!,
lll5fvk,t1_lll5982,1f8u4xq,To really give the biome a chance to fully change its about 90 days. You can exercise from the very beginning if you want though.,

m57m0gb,t3_1hsiagm,1hsiagm,"Very inspirational, you certainly look healthy and happy! I'm glad to have experienced very similar health improvements over the past 3 years following a ~90% carnivore approach after an initial first year at 100% carnivore. (Only meat, fat and organs from local game meat) Personally, I decided to add in small amounts of seasonal fruit, berries or honey after exercise to backfill muscle glycogen without having to eat stupid amounts of meat. Works great for me at a lean 220lbs with 5-6 intense exercise sessions per week and a very physical job. 

Is there any favorite meals you really enjoyed over the past few years? As a fellow food lover, I struggle with the 'monotony' a bit sometimes. I would be happy with eating rib-eyes all day everyday but with the amount of food I need to thrive and put on muscle this would absolutely break the bank at ~50€/ day minimum....",

I didn't have any weigh to loose, but lots of other health elements that I wasn't living my best life.  The straw that broke the camel's back was when my doctor prescribed the strongest dose of Prednisone for my eczema and psoriasis.  He didn't asked about my diet or lifestyle or anything, but very quick to write the medicines prescriptions.  He also wants me to be on Statin!   I wrote him a very polite and kind letter thanking him for his concerns, but also told him I am not a candidate for Statin!  Got ZERO on my CAC score and many other health markers why I am not a good candidate for this drug.  I've learn you have to be an advocate for your health.  I don't have flares up any more for eczema or psoriasis.  I am peaceful under my own skins for once in my life.  My energy is at another level I can't even imagine before.

I hope you don't go back on the SAD way of eating after 30 more lbs!
When I started I said to myself I'll just do 2 weeks. After then I wanted more of all those bodily improvements. The health benifit far out weighed the weight loss. It's the food that makes you feel fantastic. Filing in all those defientcies. Then after 6 months I knew this is it for me, no going back to that sick state.
The weight loss is great an added bonus. I'm 4.5 stone down. Stuck on a platto at the moment but that's OK. It'll go when it's ready. I'll get to optical weight and stop losing.

I still deal with some alopecia and psoriasis, though the psoriasis seems to be self resolving these days (no ointments required) and my hair is starting to return.

Transitioned from that to just meat and green veggies, and gorged on broccoli and cabbage and whatnot whenever a carb craving hit. Then over the course of a month, gradually cut down on green non starchy veggies until I eliminated vegetables entirely. Since then, no cravings, no problems.

The Cattleman's Association that represents beef runs on $55M which sounds like a lot but when you look on the grains, soybeans, corn side of things there isn't even one association that covers them all..it's like 20 or so totaling who knows close to $200M to $250M?

And that's just the spend from orgs representing growers. Nevermind all the vegan/vegetarian nonprofits...probably a other $50M my best guess?

I mean...that dwarfs it given that cattle seems to be the target for emissions and water control while everything else is given a pass.

Yes, feeding livestock is a thing but we actually produce waaaaaay more corn than we need for that in the US and we invented blending it in gasoline because we needed to find new markets for all this corn we make (granted feed corn is different than corn used for gas).

I fail to see the connection. Getting healthcare is a choice. Getting food is not. We ALL need food. We don't all need healthcare.

A business built on things that are not a choice is questionable at best.

Imagine, in 100 years time, air pollution might be so high that we require active cleaning of the air. Even newborns, who have done nothing to pollute anything, would be affected. And then we'll have to pay for fresh air. A new business.

Like food is now, since in most populated areas, hunting and farming is no allowed, unless you own your own land, which is very rare for private entities. Especially ones not having inherited things their ancestors just claimed. Because, why not? Can you claim anything these days? No. Is that good and proper? Can't even take it by force, that's against the law. Wanna leave the business? You can't, because you first have to master it to buy land somewhere. There is no way out.

So then, air, food and a place to live are businesses. Great stuff. The air we breathe and the food we consume, as well as a place to live, that should be a matter of culture, not business. A matter of humanity. You know. A greater vision of humanity. Something better than the heap of misery most of humanity is today. 

I guess I'm too weak and soft. I really dislike misery and pain. I understand that many people don't care about that. And that's fine.

Now you have to get the local prices and figure out how good of a deal it was. Considering that beef chuck is almost 8.00lb . You are getting an excellent price per pound for the more expensive cuts. Even better if you were able to get the bones and fat and organ meats. 

Last time I bought beef in bulk it was a half steer in 2012. It was 2500.00 for a half steer grass fed and grass finished. 

The only problem was one of the 
Butchers in Ripon CA stole one of my filet mignons. I don’t know how they do that. You don’t get that much filet mignon so I inventoried what they gave me and they would not acknowledge the theft or whatever happened. They only offered to give me a conventional filet and if have to drive up there from the Bay Area. Left a bad taste in my mouth. Don’t trust the butchers in ripon. 

If I remember correctly that half lasted me a year but I wasn’t carnivore then. My problem was storage. I didn’t have a chest freezer then and I was storing small boxes all over town with friends. 

It even inspired me to start a business plan for a meat storage business called Meat Club. Probs should dust that idea off again now that carnivore is so popular. I stored some of my meat at a commercial freezer facility but they wouldn’t allow game meat from hunters in there so I thought I would have allowed wild game to be stored. Good memories.",

m496n30,t1_m491qdl,1hoek9s,"Local cow, local butcher & packaging. 290 pounds of meat, I thought it seemed fair, no? This is my first time buying cow. I’d love to know if I was over charged. Haha
Edited to add: I live in California. Everything is expensive here.",
m4awzkl,t1_m49t78l,1hoek9s,"We had an option to get the organs, I declined those. Not brave enough in my carnivore journey to try those yet. I need to, though. 
For this 1/3 of cow, we got 10 filet mignons. They ranged in size. Some as small as 3oz, some as big as 8ish. That sucks the butcher ripped you off. If you’re ever interested, this place is in Madera CA. Not far from Bay Area. My husband has made the drive from Fresno CA to Pleasanton in a day a few times. 


I also picked up some ground bison while I was at the butcher shop to pick up. Excited to try that.",
m4de07c,t1_m4dad9c,1hoek9s,Got super lucky and had an acquaintance that already worked with them.,
m4g7zvj,t1_m4g5w5j,1hoek9s,I’m not worried about it,
m4axfrp,t1_m4a4xa9,1hoek9s,You can see the steaks in the photo are vacuum sealed. I do appreciate the reminder though :),
m4axjp4,t1_m4a4xa9,1hoek9s,"Usually you have a choice between the two wrappings. I preferred the butcher paper wrapping I had on the whole steer cuts. The vacuum sealed meat stayed super nice and zero freezer burn even after 1 year but the meat has a different smell vacuum sealed vs paper.  It’s not really just paper. It’s coated paper and they wrap the meat in a thin film first then the butcher paper. 

I too was concerned about not finishing the meat before it freezer burned. That whole steer took an absurdly long time to eat. If I was carnivore then I probably would have eaten most of the cuts in 6 months except for the huge amount of ground meat. 

I was lucky I went to the ranch kill of my steer and got the kidneys, the whole 12 lb liver and the brain and oxtail. The butchers don’t necessarily give you that stuff.",
m4ajgfn,t1_m49o538,1hoek9s,Plenty of people have vacuum sealers to store meat air tight.,
m4alwk9,t1_m49o538,1hoek9s,I vac seal mine after freezing them for 30min-1hr.,
m49ps6u,t1_m49o538,1hoek9s,"If you mean each cut, sure. I have no idea how long that would take to vacuum seal all the meat though!

I think if you get an industrial freezer that goes to -40C (or something like that) the losses are much less.

But yeah, I wasn't saying you were wrong, just that it is freaking hard to get good info. I personally would only store up to 6 months, but being a single guy, if I get an option for a bargain 1/4 or 1/2, I am still going to take it!",

That's about $8/lb, I've seen as low as $5.25, but thats in Ohio where my family has their own cows done. Depends how much of that weight is ground though, you're saving a lot on the steaks for sure but ground averages the price up, thats usually cheaper in the store.",
m49k87u,t1_m496n30,1hoek9s,I'm probably channeling pre-covid prices. I'm also in California and got a half a cow for $1200ish in 2019.,
m4dczoy,t1_m4awzkl,1hoek9s,Nice. Next time I get a whole or half animal I’ll look into Madera CA butchers.,

laucjan,t1_l9f7zbd,1dk3rnb,What else do you eat? There’s no way you should still be fat if you’re eating animal products only,
laucsot,t1_l9fsksj,1dk3rnb,"Most of em don’t just eat Animal products though. They eat rice, fruits, vegetables, and supplements.",
ld7eu9c,t1_l9f6un5,1dk3rnb,❤️❤️❤️❤️,❤❤❤❤
l9hnfqp,t1_l9gt7f1,1dk3rnb,True but I'm closer now than before carnivore.,
la407tq,t1_l9gt7f1,1dk3rnb,"Totally true, haha... there are a few outliers -- but if the magic diet was THAT successful, where are all the ripped, muscular carnivores at?! 


Baker and Chaffee (and as naturals, a bit sketchy...) are about the only 2 mainstream. I saw the more recent carnivore influencer get together with them and again, a number of those people did not appear to be in great shape, going purely by visual assessment. ",
la7q5h2,t1_l9gt7f1,1dk3rnb,"Correct. I have not seen too many fit carnivores other than the doctors, although Ken Berry has a belly. Some really obese carnivores have lost a lot of weight but they don't seem to lose anymore once they hit a plateau and they actually remain overweight, although not morbidly obese. ",
l9jmjl2,t1_l9gt7f1,1dk3rnb,Never gonna be that lean for any decent period of time eating ribeyes with tons of butter and bacon everyday lmao,

l9fspcf,t1_l9fjzhs,1dk3rnb,"The guy in the photo isn't just lean, he's muscular as well. That's an important difference. Yeah people can lose weight starving themselves on veggies, but they won't be muscular. They won't have nice skin.",

lai69zs,t1_l9jbjni,1dk3rnb,Correct,
l9tsh4x,t1_l9t1w8u,1dk3rnb,"Oh my gosh. Why didn't I ever think of that? You're a genius! If only I had consistently exercised! How could I have overlooked such a basic part of a weight loss plan? Thanks man. You're really smart. Are you in mensa? You should be. You're a genius! I think you have the ultimate cure to the obesity epidemic. You need to reach out to all the news agencies you can with this groundbreaking idea. People need to know about how consistent exercise helps with weight loss. We need to start writing letters to our representatives about this, you know? No, this is too important. We need to go straight to the president! I'm going to write a letter to the president right now. I suggest you do the same. Thank you so much. My life will never be the same thanks to your brilliant idea.",
laudlsu,t1_laucjan,1dk3rnb,"Now? I eat keto. As much or as little plants as  I want. When I was carnivore for 18 months I ate chuck steaks. About two pounds a day. I tried cheese a few times, but it made me horribly painfully constipated every time. I did lose a tiny amount of weight during that year and a half.",
l9kaugy,t1_l9jmjl2,1dk3rnb,Incorrect,
l9o5i7o,t1_l9jmjl2,1dk3rnb,"I lost 40 pounds while eating tons of fat. I was averaging 6,000 calories a day (1 pound of beef fat by itself is 3,500) early on, and the weight just melted off.",
l9nkds2,t1_l9jmjl2,1dk3rnb,"It can be done with ribeyes and butter, can also be done with junk food.   The requirements are a lifetime of gym + either good genetics or steroids.

People who think just eating carnivore will make them lean and jacked are delusional though.",
l9iovf8,t1_l9ij6bm,1dk3rnb,You lose weight on vegan because the lectins slough your intestinal lining and you can't absorb nutrients anymore. that and the food is about as nutrient dense as cardboard.,
l9iy7u1,t1_l9fspcf,1dk3rnb,There are exactly zero physique competitors that have built their body without carbs,
l9fv80j,t1_l9fspcf,1dk3rnb,I mean countless people have built muscle eating a diet of lean meats and the standard carb sources. In fact still a large amount of people do. The photo is extremely exaggerated is the point. I notice tons of people doing this in the carnivore community.,
laiiy1y,t1_lai68p3,1dk3rnb,Haha,
l9uwsuw,t1_l9tsh4x,1dk3rnb,"As sarcastic as this was it really is that revelatory unless being fat is health related for you. It’s simple. If you’re fat, workout and stop eating a bunch of crap. Get your thyroid checked.

Out of curiosity, if you know what’s health and seemingly know that exercise is good for you and weight loss why are just accepting that you’re fat?",
lauedbl,t1_laudlsu,1dk3rnb,"How is it working out? You’ll probably get offended, but there was something that you were  doing wrong. And constipation sucks.  But poop isn’t supposed to be soft. If it’s soft is because your body didn’t use all the nutrients. That’s why they say meat is the most bioavailable food.",
l9o6rsm,t1_l9o5i7o,1dk3rnb,How much did you weigh wtf,
l9o6wf1,t1_l9o5i7o,1dk3rnb,"Thats awesome, but did you get to the level of lean ness show in the picture",
l9o72p9,t1_l9nkds2,1dk3rnb,"I tried all that. Only cooked with extra virgin olive oil. Ate tons of garlic, onion, and green pepper. Didn't care for sweets. Didn't eat out at all. Gained a lot of weight. Tried cycling an hour a day- intense, getting covered in sweat. My weight didn't budge. I quit. 2 months later, I decided to try eating nothing but meat, and my weight started plummeting. Even when I was eating nothing but beef fat for breakfast every day, I was still dropping pounds. Lots of ribeyes and bacon. Lost 40 pounds in 4 months. If I'm delusional, it's a hell of a delusion.",
l9kay0c,t1_l9iy7u1,1dk3rnb,There are,
l9fw663,t1_l9fv80j,1dk3rnb,It worked for me. I could never put on muscle despite years of working out. Then I started 200 grams a day of protein and I could build muscle just doing nothing.,
lavdojg,t1_lauedbl,1dk3rnb,"I mostly had diarrhea. I got seriously backed up if I ate cheese, though. Back pain, hard as rock shit that was very difficult and painful to pass. True constipation.


I ate beef, salt, and water when I didn't have cheese, which was only a few times, but you're right, I must have been doing it wrong. It's a pretty complicated diet, after all.",
l9o8417,t1_l9o6rsm,1dk3rnb,220 pounds. I don't think things work in the way mainstream thinks it does. Nothing really makes sense. Except perhaps fat storage being a safety mechanism for the liver.,
l9o7t2p,t1_l9o72p9,1dk3rnb,"That's great, but losing weight and being ripped isn't the same thing.  Carnivore is great for getting anyone to a healthy weight, but my point is you won't look like the picture in the OP, that requires much more.

Someone starting at an already healthy weight or good physique won't suddenly turn into Hercules.",
l9gt4lv,t1_l9fw663,1dk3rnb,"That's not because of carnivore, it sounds like you were just under eating protein before.  Basically everyone that workouts out uses heaps of whey protein or eats chicken breast all day for a reason.",
l9iyded,t1_l9fw663,1dk3rnb,Nobody builds muscle doing nothing. Resistance training is necessary. Stop lying.,
l9g04w7,t1_l9fw663,1dk3rnb,That's weird. I got huge before carnivore and have maintained on this diet. You must've done something off because 99% of transformations you see are done off carnivore.,
l9o8wvw,t1_l9o7t2p,1dk3rnb,"I can agree with that. You still have to push with the workouts. But it does make it easier. I really like not being sore after workouts. I tried pushing to muscle failure- it was awesome, still having my arms available the next day. It's very different than when I was in a recon unit in my 20s. Much easier.",
l9g5ich,t1_l9g04w7,1dk3rnb,That's my experience and frankly you'd have to offer some pretty convincing evidence to trump my personal life changing experience.,
l9ga18j,t1_l9g5ich,1dk3rnb,The evidence that there's thousands upon thousands of examples of people building muscular physiques without going carnivore? Walk into any gym and 99%+ of those people aren't eating this way yet they've gotten bigger and stronger. Same goes for bodybuilders and elite athletes in recorded history. This community is really becoming as bad as vegans I guess if you're in denial about something like that.,
l9hjdnv,t1_l9ga18j,1dk3rnb,"But most of them eat eggs and steak I bet and are often “clean eaters” you can’t get jacked eating garbage. Maybe on some uber godly genetics and young age, but not in most case. 

The meme (supposed to be funny jesus uou all serious ppl) points to all those haters who talk shit about carnivore diet, despite never having tried it and in most cases they look like shit while also thinking they are so smart.",
l9iyktn,t1_l9hjdnv,1dk3rnb,Carbs are always present in those people's diets and I'm not talking about vegetables,
l9l1xb1,t1_l9iyktn,1dk3rnb,"Yeah, lots of carbs, often low protein and lots of junk (aware of it or not)",
l9le2nu,t1_l9l1xb1,1dk3rnb,"I'm talking about jacked and strong people. They eat very little junk, a lot of lean protein and good carbs. Lots of oatmeal, rice, wholegrain pasta and vegetables.",
l9lg8jw,t1_l9le2nu,1dk3rnb,"Wholegrain pasta and oatmeal aren’t a good carbs. Especially not “lots of it”  

Also these people will still very likely eat steak and eggs and wouldn’t make the kind of stupid comments this meme is targeting",
l9lggxy,t1_l9lg8jw,1dk3rnb,"On this sub there is no such thing as a good carb.

However, in the real world, many lifters enjoy oatmeal and rice as staples in their diet, with great success, whether you accept it or not.",
l9oj97w,t1_l9lggxy,1dk3rnb,I know they do. If you noticed I haven’t said anything against rice or fruit. Anything that has gluten in it or similar substance simply isn’t good. I also never said that you can’t build muscle on it. You have completely missed the point of this joke and what the debate was about.,

lm6p7g1,t1_lm2b437,1farwcp,"Ahh, there’s so much to get into here, but I’d suggest starting with meats you like. Homemade burger patties made with just beef and salt are perfect with eggs. Eat until you’re satiated, and eat again when you’re hungry. Use cold pure butter as your sauce or condiment—it’s super easy and keeps you full for a long time. If you want to add steak, which is amazing when cooked right, check out some videos on how to make a good steak. It’s actually quite simple. I watched a couple of TikToks and YouTube videos to make a pretty tasty ribeye using only salt. Continue eating this way and commit to 30 days. My daily cheat is black coffee, and I sometimes have organic, sugar-free bacon, though I see better gains without it.",

llzp0fu,t1_llwaatc,1farwcp,"I followed a fairly healthy diet, with an occasional snack here and there, but I really tried to eat balanced meals. Over the past few years, I’ve tried almost every diet. I was vegan for two years, from 2017 to 2019, during which I developed IBS, depression, and terrible brain fog. My doctor and I couldn’t explain my stomach problems. In 2020, I tried keto for a bit, and in 2022, I attempted the carnivore diet for the first time, but I ended up doing a ‘dirty’ version with a lot of milk and cheese. I eventually quit and switched to the AIP diet and also tried the low FODMAP diet. The breaks between diets were what could be considered a healthy lifestyle, but I always ended up gaining weight and feeling terrible. I’m very happy with this way of eating (WOE), and I try to incorporate occasional water fasts",
llysjyz,t1_llwbad8,1farwcp,"For me, 100% yes!",
llyx2h4,t1_llwf6ec,1farwcp,"I’ve been on the carnivore diet since May. I slipped up by adding fruits for a week in July, then added some junk food while visiting my relatives and started binging for another week on standard foods like cookies and ice cream, so I fell off for about two weeks in July. I came out of it and went back to strictly eggs, butter, bacon, and beef (plus coffee) for about three weeks. Then I went to Italy in August, where I had all the pasta, gelato, and pizza. When I came home, it took me about a week and a half to get off sugar. So, I fell off again in August for around two and a half weeks. Now I’ve been back on carnivore for almost six days. I plan to incorporate a 24-36 hour fast once a week. I didn’t gain all the weight back, even though I had fallen off here and there for quite long periods, which has been amazing. Of course, I gained some weight as soon as I added back other foods, but it was never a crazy amount. However, I did lose my mental clarity whenever I cheated!",

lxai42w,t1_lx9jac7,1grultz,So much better! Like I have no clue how I was functioning before. Completely with it,
lxadlzw,t1_lxa4zxv,1grultz,"So I eat 1-2 meals a day (busy mom life), I prefer beef and most days I eat an average of 2lbs/day. I rarely eat chicken, but if I have chicken I still eat some beef. 2-3 times a week I’ll eat 4-5 eggs. But that’s about it. Now that I’ve been doing this for 10 months I know how to listen to my body and I just follow cues. Now there have been some days I’ve eaten 5lbs of meat and that’s what it took. But on the flip side I’ve also had days where I just wasn’t even hungry at all (big hormonal shift days that coincide with my cycle) and therefore don’t eat at all.

My ideal regular day is 2lbs ribeye or thin sliced t-bone. 

On a “special occasion” day I like to make an omelette with prosciutto, feta cheese, and sour cream for breakfast and then later have ribeye and oven roasted chicken thighs. Ive only had 4 of these days in the last 10 months and plan to do them for thanksgiving/christmas/new years (really it’ll be to celebrate 1 year carnivore)",
lxaexwd,t1_lxa4zxv,1grultz,"Also, I’m typically strict. I eat meat (99% unprocessed, the only thing minimally processed is prosciutto once in a blue moon), Uncured or home cured bacon, eggs, butter, salt, water and sparkling water.

My less-strict things (but as mentioned before it’s rare) are dairy related. Cheese, sour cream, and a bit of cream",
lx9mgyj,t1_lx9lssz,1grultz,"I was proud of losing 15kg in two years :) Did that with a SAD diet and CiCo though, so it was a horrible experience at that. So I was proud being a moron, really.

This info conflicts the usda's myplate which is publicly acceptable and probably what they believe is healthy since it was published. I feel it's a reflection of poor nutritional education. I can understand their apprehension as these ideas seem extreme to others and, to them, feels like another snake oil salesman to fix their serious mh issues with this one easy hack! Depression and anxiety is very complex and many of them have been thru some serious trauma and never have been taught how to process their emotions and pain. The suggestion of a quick change of diet was probably received as an undercutting and insensitive of their suffering.

I agree with you; I believe carnivore diet can assist in improving these issues. I also believe fasting is one of the healthiest things a person could do, and I was warned in this reddit about talking about it too much once. Could be seen as a topic thing",

Normally I ask about their diet, ask if they have tried making any changes, then I ask if they know any interesting diet mental health books. This is normally met with a no and I get to point them towards the amazing work of Dr Georgia Ede in Change your diet, to change your mind.

Most processed foods were created out of necessity, especially during wartime, to ensure they wouldn’t spoil or as a last resort when nothing else was available. That’s why sticking to natural, nutrient-dense foods like those in a carnivore diet can make such a noticeable difference in how we feel.

That said, I also feel it’s important to support other diets, like keto or plant-based ones, because where we live, how our ancestors lived, and what they ate for healing or daily nutrition have a huge impact on our bodies.

m5on0mg,t1_m5olglq,1huwx23,"Traditional Cooking Fats in Mongolia
	1.	Animal Fat (Тос):
	•	Rendered Fat (Tallow):
	•	Made from the fat of sheep, goats, yaks, or cows. This was the primary “oil” for frying, sautéing, or adding to soups and stews.
	•	Sheep fat, in particular, was prized for its rich flavor and availability.
	•	Tail Fat (Lamb Tail, Өвчүү):
	•	Mongolian sheep (e.g., the fat-tailed sheep) store a significant amount of fat in their tails, which was often rendered and used for cooking. It adds richness to dishes.
	2.	Butter (Цөцгийн тос):
	•	Mongolians traditionally made butter from cow, yak, or goat milk. It was used sparingly for cooking or as an additive to enhance the flavor of soups, teas, and breads.
	3.	Milk Cream (Өрөм):
	•	A thick layer of cream skimmed from boiled milk. While not typically used for frying, it was added to enhance the richness of dishes like stews or dumplings.
	4.	Fat from Meat:
	•	Cooking often involved frying or boiling meats with their own fat. No additional oil needed, as the fat from the meat itself would render out during cooking.",

I’ve started researching it again and asked many friends about their experiences. Some found it tiring or didn’t feel it suited them, but others, especially Mongolians, had amazing results. That’s when it hit me—this diet might work better for certain people due to genetic reasons.

For example, Mongolians who have done or are still doing the carnivore diet don’t seem to have the problems you mentioned, like snoring, high blood pressure, or acid reflux. Personally, I’m just starting the diet again now, and I’ll be happy to share my progress and experiences with you!",

But traditionally, raw meat wasn’t really a part of our diet—it’s more about hearty, cooked meals that suit our nomadic lifestyle and climate.",
m5ompu7,t1_m5olooj,1huwx23,"Mongolians have a traditional belief system about red meat, categorizing it into “warm meat” (халуун мах) and “cold meat” (хүйтэн мах) based on the effects it has on the body and its suitability for different seasons. This theory stems from the nomadic lifestyle and deep connection to nature, where food was used not only for sustenance but also to maintain harmony with the environment and the body.

Warm Meat (“Халуун мах”)

Definition:
	•	Meat that is believed to provide heat and energy, making it ideal for cold climates or seasons.
	•	Typically fattier and richer, it helps the body withstand harsh winters.

Examples:
	•	Horse meat: Considered one of the warmest meats, it’s eaten during Mongolia’s harsh winters (up to -40°C).
	•	Beef: Also warming, suitable for colder months.

Cultural Beliefs:
	•	Consuming warm meat is thought to improve blood circulation, boost energy, and help the body retain warmth in extreme cold.
	•	It is particularly recommended for people with weak constitutions or those recovering from illness.

Cold Meat (“Хүйтэн мах”)

Definition:
	•	Meat that is considered lighter, cooling, and easier to digest, suitable for warmer weather or when the body needs balance.

Examples:
	•	Goat meat: Often eaten in the summer for its cooling properties.
	•	Lamb: While not as cooling as goat, it is considered more neutral and often eaten during transitional seasons like spring.
	•	Fish: Categorized as cold meat, ideal for summer or lighter meals.

..
	•	Cold meat is thought to help cool the body, making it more suitable for warm weather.
	•	It is believed to balance “excess heat” in the body during hot seasons or in people prone to heat-related conditions.

Seasonal Balance

Mongolians adapt their diets based on this warm-cold theory:
	•	Winter: Focus on warm meats like horse and beef to combat the cold.
	•	Summer: Transition to cold meats like goat, fish, or lighter portions of lamb to avoid overheating.
	•	Spring (“Sensitive Season”): Lamb and dried meat (“borts”) are preferred to maintain balance as the body adjusts to seasonal and emotional changes.

Practical Applications Today
	•	The warm-cold theory aligns with the seasonal availability of livestock in nomadic culture.
	•	It’s also connected to Mongolian medicine and the belief that diet influences physical and emotional well-being.
	•	Modern Mongolians still incorporate these practices, especially in rural areas, where seasonal eating is common.",

As for the carnivore diet, fruits and vegetables aren’t typically included. Since tried the diet a few years ago, I’ve noticed my body doesn’t respond as well to carbs or veggies anymore.

oh man, exactly my experience. i was a big salad eater before and loved any kind of veg. after 6 month of carnivore i dropped and now started again.

i cant do salads, i cant salad veggies. forget corn or heavy stuff like groats or quinoa. it literally hurts me passing from stomach to ... toilet. cramps and all, i know literally where it is.

potatoes and roots are better digestible for me than above stuff. fruits in small amounts, otherwise i suffer sugar rush & crash hard.

m6w3waj,t1_m6w0tfb,1hzgzsu,"Im touring musician on the road half the year, so my day to day varies depending what I have access to. But when I’m home, I play basketball 2-3 times a week and lift heavy every day. I don’t do any other cardio outside of that. In the summer I take my dog on 30-60 min walks too. 

Weight lifting 3 day split:
-chest, back, triceps 
-shoulders, biceps, abs 
-legs 

I do at least 3 exercises with 4 sets of 8-12 reps per exercise. Each set I go to failure. So 12 total sets per day. 

Some days I do 4 exercises. 

I try and variate the exercises as much as I can. (Incline bench press one day then regular bench press next chest day, etc) 

If I’m in the van all week, I’ll crank out 50-75 push ups at each gas station stop (and just ignore the hoots and hollers from the general public). I also bring a 60 lb kettle ball and crank out a bunch of different exercises. 

It’s been a really hard journey to force myself to workout hard everyday. I had a pivotal friend/bandmate hold me accountable, which I think is so key to success. He taught me the mentality needed in order to hit hard ever every. Single. Day.",

We also will cut off all the cap fat, dice it up, and fry a pound to split between my wife and I for breakfast. A half pound is over 1,500 calories. It's great with shredded cheese and a little salt. We then chop up the meat and put it in stews. Chuck roast makes a great beef jerky- try to get the fattiest cuts you can. Chicken thighs make for fantastic chicken soup with some salt- the veggies don't seem to have added any flavor whatsoever. We usually try to save the liquid and boil it all the way down to a gravy. We often add different ingredients like beef gelatin or milk powder for different consistencies and flavors.

**Your comment** about plants made me laugh because it is true; even though you intended no pun, humans do follow signposts that are ""planted"" all the time, whether they believe those signs to come from, or are related to, god or jesus, allah, or whoever- 
or not.

**That being said** about god and perogatives, I think OP can - and should - attribute the results of a Carnivore Diet to himself and his own efforts as well. Per his beliefs, god may have provided or guided OP, but OP still did a lot of work too. 

**As you say,** people must take accountability and be accountable. Even if god is taken out of the equation, the reasoning and sentiment of your comment still stands. People need to use their intelligence, common sense, and critical thinking skills to remain and be as physically, mentally, and emotionally healthy as they can.

**It reminds me** of a quote from the film *Ever After: A Cinderella Story* (1998) where Leonardo Da Vinci says to Prince Henry: ""You cannot leave everything to fate, boy. She's got a lot to do. Sometimes you must give her a hand."" 

**Be it fate,** god, the flying spaghetti monster, or hope, they cannot do it all. We have to help ourselves.

m8s7gwi,t1_m8s3ymw,1i7oqzh,"That's too bad. Here is some of the items from the list for you:

I also have Carnivore pizza with a mozzarella and pork rind crust, white sauce, and scrambled egg and prosciutto toppings. Hush puppies, Carnivore bread- (both the pork rind version and the other which is a bit like angel food cake), chicken nuggets (with pork rind and milk breading), milanesa, deep fried chicken, Carnivore pancakes (topped with lactose sugar), bacon egg and cheese bake, stroganoff with cream cheese, pork rinds with cream cheese (and smoked salmon!), grilled ham and cheese with Carnivore bread, tuna melt.


 Any combination of bowls: hamburger, shredded cheese, bacon, scrambled egg, shredded beef, shredded chicken, shredded pork, chicken gravy, and sour cream.


Seafood stew made from a seafood mix, oysters, lump crab meat, clams, mussels etc.

Clam chowder can be made with clams and milk/heavy cream/or the condensed, sweetened milk for the ice cream.

Condiments: sour cream (will be your favorite), red boat fish sauce, caviar, cottage cheese, heavy whipping cream, double cream, half n half, Carnivore pizza sauce, reduced beef broth, reduced chicken broth, cheeses.

Carnivore tortillas:

4 large eggs
3 ounces pork rinds
Salt to taste (or simply sprinkled on top)
1/3 cup water
Butter for cooking

1: Blend together all ingredients except the butter.

2: melt butter on frying pan at medium low heat. Add pancake batter to make small tortillas (large ones tear too easily).

3: Cook for about 7 minutes. Flip, and cook for an additional 7 minutes. Tortillas should brown a bit on either side. Enjoy!

Chicken Nuggets

4 lbs ground chicken
1 cup pork rinds, blended
1 cup milk
1 tbsp salt
Eggs

Breading:
Parmesan
Pork rinds

1. Add crushed pork rinds to mixing bowl, pour milk on top. Mix.

2. Let absorb 2-3 minutes, add salt, mix.

3. Combine parmesan and blended pork rinds for breading mixture.

4. Crack and whip eggs in separate bowl.

5. Use a small ice cream scoop for chicken, then dip in egg and roll in bread mixture. 

6. Air fry 15-18 minutes (or bake at 375°)


Angel Food Cake


Bake 25 minutes at 300℉


Ingredients
For each layer of cake

8 eggs
Separate whites from yolks
8 oz cream cheese
¼ tsp cream of tartar
pinch of salt

Preparation

Beat on high 8 egg whites and ¼ tsp cream of tartar until stiff and can tip it upside down
In another bowl  mix egg yolks, 8oz of cream cheese, pinch of salt, and beat until mostly smooth.
Very gently , combine the egg whites and yolks into one bowl by adding the yolk mixture into the whites bit by bit and slowly folding it in. Do this until the mixture is evenly distributed. Do not quickly mix or vigorously stir this mixture, which could cause the egg whites to fall.
Pour the mixture into a well-greased 9 x 13 non-stick pan (I prefer to use butter to grease the bottom and sides).
Bake for 25 minutes; remove the cakes when you see a light tan color form on the top.
While the cakes are baking, use a mixer to whip the heavy cream in a large bowl until it reaches the thickness/consistency of Cool Whip.
When the “cakes” are done baking, pull them out and let them cool. When cool, gently remove from the pan. (They sometimes stick, so you may need to use a spatula to loosen the bottoms. They will get thickly covered in cream soon, so it doesn’t matter if they look good or if they crumble a little.)
Cover the bottom layer of cake with a thick layer of cream. Place the top cake on and thickly cover the cake in heavy cream.

Last tip:

Hickory smoke gives a nice peppery flavor. It's great by itself but if you pan smoke some brisket, then add lactose sugar to the beef fat drippings and pour it back over, the peppery sweetness is a lot like barbecue sauce.",

lojnu2e,t1_lojmwii,1fmyqro,"My youngest daughter is almost 2. I did breastfeed her up until the day before I started this WOE on July 6th. Unfortunately, I had tried cutting carbs during my breastfeeding journey and my supply instantly tanked. I was not willing to wean my daughter at that time or mess around with my supply. So I just hung in there until I was ready to wean. Started the very next day because I was like ""it's time to work on me!"" 😅 I've heard of many women who are able to breastfeed while doing Carnivore but I was not one of them. Perhaps it's easier to achieve if you're already adapted to it when you begin breastfeeding.",😅
lopupcn,t1_lop4de0,1fmyqro,"Thank you! It's literally just steak and eggs every day for me 😅 A typical day would be about 3 eggs with melted butter mixed in for breakfast around 11am, then 1 lb of steak with butter and salt around 3 or 4pm. Some days I'll only have steak and so I'll have a little more than 1lb. Typically, if I have my 1lb steak for breakfast, I don't even feel like I need to eat later on but I do anyways because I've noticed my body prefers two meals a day. Occasionally I'll have other things but very rarely. Such as bacon, cheese, salami, and non-carnivore things too like a little avocado, coconut water, and a handful of fruit. (I started out having those things more frequently and now I just don't feel the need for them anymore.) You have to do what works for you, even if that means easing in to it! To afford earing steak every day, I buy a whole chuck roll from US Chef Foods or Costco (you have to ask the meat department), and I cut the whole thing into 1.5 inch steaks. They are delicious! Some are chewier than others but most are tender and perfect so I don't mind. This costs about $5/steak. I hope this helps!",😅
lojoq3a,t1_loig39g,1fmyqro,"Ah yes, I left that one out. I have had a very stable mood since starting this WOE too. I think there were times I'd be irritable and cranky for no reason.

lon7qts,t1_lojlxji,1fmyqro,"So did you have to eat more at first until you had stable energy and then you didn't have to eat as much?

Thank you for answering 😊 ",😊

lonc0x6,t1_lon7qts,1fmyqro,"No, I've been eating approximately the same amount since I started. After logging for a while I realized that 1lb of meat is about 1500 calories so as long as I ate that with a pat of butter, I was getting enough. And so that's what I still eat except sometimes I'll have a few eggs or nibble on other carnivore things here and there. The reason I eat the same thing every day is because I know it's enough to sustain me while also losing weight :) hope this helps!",

lm6pepn,t1_lm26uss,1fbi3do,Awww thank you so much! So nice of you to say 🥹,🥹
lm309hh,t1_lm2khbg,1fbi3do,"I understand that it might work for some, but what is important to emphasize is the 80%. 

I was a strict vegan for about two years, from 2017 to 2020, and I supplemented vitamins and made almost all of my food from scratch, using very little processed food. Despite this, I developed IBS, severe sweating, worse menstrual cramps, depression, and PMS from the vegan diet. It is not for me. 

I am half Scandinavian and half Ugandan. My grandad on my Ugandan side is 111 years old, lives in Uganda, and eats primarily meat and fish, but also includes vegetables and fruits that grow on their land (I’d say 80% meat and 20% vegetables; they raise their own animals and grow their own produce). He is still walking, very level-headed, super happy, and a man of faith. 

My grandma on my Scandinavian side is primarily vegetarian but does include meat occasionally (I’d say 90% vegetables and 10% meat). She and my mom both suffer from many health issues. I grew up with my vegetarian mom, eating primarily vegetarian, and have had many issues because of that (I still ate meat growing up, it just wasn’t our primary food). My grandma is only in her late 70s but has severe dementia and does not remember us. She has also always looked ‘old’; even when I was little, she looked old despite being young. 

I’m not saying a full carnivore diet is something everyone needs to do, but it’s good to experiment with your own diet. And while trying, be strict! Otherwise, it’s easy to disregard the results",
lm2kswn,t1_lm2khbg,1fbi3do,"+ do you stink? No offense, I’m asking because my sparring buddy went on this type of diet for a few months and would smell rancid/leave a disgusting meaty odor everywhere in the gym. He’s now a pescatarian and performs well/smells good.",
ln02pnj,t1_lm6r47v,1fbi3do,It’s only the fasting. That’s good…what happens next is your arteries clog form fat and no fiber and you start damaging your gut so you can’t absorb nutrients anymore. Plants are human food nmostly fruit,
lm7b9il,t1_lm6qv5b,1fbi3do,"Hi! Yes, I do a 72-90 hour fast every 3 months, I started extended fasting in 2019. It does the body wonders. 
I'm about 90% carnivore.",
lm6u5pu,t1_lm6sq5a,1fbi3do,"No problem! Im down 28 lbs in 5 weeks but I haven’t exercised a single time. I’m proving to the people around me that it’s not about exercising to lose weight all the time. 

There’s 3 heavier women at work that like to work out at the gym on their lunch break. They don’t look that good, they just look unhealthy and inflamed like I did. When I told them I was doing carnivore they scoffed and thought it was so unhealthy, but one of them was kind of open to it…

Either way they’ve been working out for like over a year and they still complain how they haven’t lost a pound.

Once I’m down to about 210 I’m going to start cardio and lifting.",
lxqxmkb,t1_lx586nh,1fbi3do,Okay cool thanks for the tips ☺️ so I guess I'll have to be careful about added sugar in bacon 🥓😢,☺🥓😢
lm311fk,t1_lm2kswn,1fbi3do,"No offense taken. In fact, I have less body odor now, and my sense of smell seems even sharper, though it’s always been strong. I don’t think it’s your friend’s body odor you’re noticing, but I could be wrong. It’s more likely the smell of cooking meat combined with poor ventilation. That can get into your hair and linger on your body, which isn’t pleasant. However, since switching to this diet, my sweat and private areas smell much better. I can even tell when my partner, who isn’t on a carnivore diet, is about to get sick just by his scent. He tells me I smell good, and I often get compliments from friends and colleagues on how good I smell (probably also because my hair product smell amazingly fresh). But if I stand over a frying pan with my big hair while cooking a steak, I’ll definitely pick up some of that scent. And since I’m not sweating as much on this diet, it can sometimes trick me into thinking I don’t need a shower",
m14vuxi,t1_lm7b9il,1fbi3do,I know what fasting means but you literally eat nothing for 48 hrs? Do you drink anything for some energy,

m4vgspj,t1_m4vf7f1,1hr67xm,"They do. About .5-.7 g per egg. Technically meat has some carb amount as well from muscle glycogen.

m52nd01,t1_m52i50c,1hr67xm,"Depends how long it's been aged. But meat does have trace amounts, even if aged a long time.

Either they don't like what they hear and the conversation ends, or they defend themselves and we end up in an argument that gets nowhere.

Most people are going for the treatment which is elimination for allergies and inflammation, correcting nutritional deficiencies and weight loss. People who have chronic joint inflammation, gut problems or autoimmune disorders need the lifestyle. For that, you first need the treatment, then once fully eliminated and feeling good, reintroduce inoffensive foods to be part of your forever diet.

I've said before, I hate the ""carnivore-ish"" flare because it skips the treatment. People come here and say, ""Oh look, I can have avocado, fruit and honey on this diet!"" No. The flair should be something like ""Life after carnivore"" so you understand, you can't get the benefit of elimination without eliminating.",

It's the other way around. The carnivore diet started as an intervention diet, not a lifestyle. Nobody did it just for fun. Suddenly it's a positive to not being able to stomach a damn potato? It shows strength?

Make a *strictcarnivore* sub. All problems solved.

Carnivore should be about healing, and nothing else. My opinion and way of seeing this.

I have no idea why people were forced to call it animal based. It's carnivore. In every other animal kingdom it would count as carnivores. 

We were calling ourselves carnivore before YouTube existed. In the last decade, fanatics took over and made it an ideology, no better than the vegans. With outrageous claims like plants trying to kill you. Not all plants. Plenty of plants are neutral. We keep away from predatory animals, we can just as well keep clear of dangerous plants.

Get all important nutrients from meat, and consume other stuff based on personal experience or group experience. 

There is a reason why people say ***strict carnivore***. Because it's an extreme form. Like Devout Christians. Claiming additional benefits, despite having millions of people not having trouble, but just a few who seem to be unlucky, that's dogma, not reasoning.

Unless you are stricken with dysfunction, there isn't a single reason to be strict.

And having a potato once a week doesn't make me animal based. It's carnivore with a hint of side-dishes.
Having cheesecake on Thursdays doesn't make me animal based. It's carnivore with cheesecake on Thursdays.

Carnivore is much more than the base. It's also the body. Just not the garnish. If you require non-animal products but are getting most of your nutrients from animals, then it is animal based. It stops being animal based when you can just leave out the rest.",

I’d agree it’s a good diet for those who don’t know how to control their eating and need to cleanse and/or heal. There are also plenty of people more educated than you and more disciplined than you who are eating fruits, veggies, and grains and who are also in better shape.

Thus I like the 70%/30% MINIMUM, and you can titrate up to more strict as desired. This means at least 70% of your daily intake, and you fill in the remaining 30% as you see fit.

I have to believe our ancestors of yore would have fruit WHEN IN SEASON, and thus as a rare treat, especially depending on where they lived.

ly7qu5v,t3_1gvlumi,1gvlumi,"Personally I think you're getting upset for no reason. While there are those who are getting benefits following the diet very strictly. Good for you and the others that can do it.

But, not everyone is the same.

For example. I started the carnivore diet two and half months ago. It was for no other reason that I was very curious. Butt, after almost 3 weeks I had to change it and make it less strict. I work in television production and spend 9 to 10 months a year traveling and I was feeling like crap, which I never felt before. And this was interfering with my job and was an impact on my 23 person crew. 

Someone said just use supplements. Not a reality when like when we went to Burma. It would have been confiscated. And in Shan State where we went and were only the second western TV crew in 27 years. We had dinners and lunches with local officials and for protocol you eat and drink what your given. Same with other places.

Same with flying. Just recently we had to fly London to New York, then after two days Tokyo with a 2 hour stop over in Los Angeles, Tokyo for 1 day, then to Melbourne. There is now carnivore choice on airplanes. And when we check into a hotel as production manager my day doesn't end until I know the rest of the crew have been checked in and all out equipment has arrived. Then up at 4am, maybe after 2 hours sleep, up before everyone else.

I've seen a few benefits. For weight thats been the same for nearly 30 years, always between 87kg too 90kg. Don't have any problems sleeping or waking up. Don't have any aches or pains to speak of, except for a few that come and go depending on what climate I'm in or altitude. I have to say the last one is interesting. Since starting the carnivore diet. I no longer get altitude sickness.  Which anytime we were in an environment of 2000 meters or more I would get ill. But, the last two times in Bolivia. I was totally fine.

I've never been a fan of sweets or cakes or sodas or crisps And I can't stand beer, and loath tea. I've always drank water, coffee, wine, and in a week maybe 2 or 3 G&Ts a week. I've never been a fan of vegetables. With the exception mushrooms, artichokes, potatoes, and maybe a salad once and while.

The big problem I've seen with the carnivore diet. Isn't the diet itself. But, rather certain ""so called"" influencers. That are pushing the idea that the diet cures everything and pushing a false narrative of grass fed this, range free than and so on and so on. If you were to follow their advice. You would be spending a few hundred dollars or more a week. Something that the average person just can't do. They all seem to be based in the US. One of my assistants is from Japan, but has been living in Australia for the last 17 years. When we were discussing this, he told me in Japan you would go broke in a week if you followed such a diet. Beef along is about 60% more than they US. In Taiwan, Singapore it's also high. Here in the Netherlands we pay less than in the UK, but also way higher than in the US. So it isn't feasible for most of the world. Mongolia it was easy, but after a while you get sick of yak. If you've never tasted yak. It's mutton thats gone off.

In anything you will have those being called ""fanatics"". Just like in veganism. Ok ok I admit they are crazy. 

I say just ignore them.

ly49qdn,t1_ly44pu0,1gvlumi,"Some will go back to the standard diet but most won't. Most don't get to this diet unless they're in enough pain to defy doctors, dietitians and concerned family. No one will return to the standard diet after knowing that it's possible to be pain free. The point of elimination is to identify the foods that affect you. Once you eliminate seed oils and chemicals from your diet even for just a few months, consuming them again will cause a more severe negative reaction. Depending on metabolic disorders and allergies that have developed, many fruits and veggies will also give you a negative reaction. This is the process where carnivore is most effective. You have to eliminate to see exactly what is harming you. Some people can go back to clean plant foods, some never will.

If you're not in pain or too young for the metabolic damage of the standard diet to set then it's not necessary to eliminate plant foods permanently, just the ultra processed foods. Humans were far healthier 200 years ago eating meat and taters cooked in lard. One day I hope to see society get back to that.

I, for instance, had a mostly meat, high fat diet recommended to me by a doctor as a form of elimination diet to address autoimmune issues. Such diets have been known of and used for centuries in various cultures and times. 

You seem desperate to make a very simple way of eating, aimed at very simple purposes, out to be an ""ideology"". Doing so makes you look ill informed, and potentially ignorant of what the words you are easing actually mean. Do better to educate yourself. 

>Not a single animal on this planet is a strict carnivore.

Here, you are mixing up two definitions of a word. There is the application to the carnivore human diet, and then there is the application to the biological label of ""carnivore"". I am glad you realized how stupid you sounded claiming there are no ""strict carnivores"" on the planet.

You not having seen that doesn't make it untrue. There are thousands of videos on YouTube. And other sources.

We consider them the ultimate carnivore animal? Should we call all obligate carnivores animal based now instead? Because of willpower? What is this, celibate? 

I eat cheesecake. For fun. Not for nutrition. Even though I could, to some extent.

Humans can be just fine on a plant-based diet. And yet you hold us to higher standards for fulfilling the term of carnivore, even though we are not even obligate carnivores? Where does that make sense, outside of ideology?

I'm fine with that stance. But excluding all non-strict carnivores is a strange notion.

Make it the other way around. Make a sub for strict ones. It would be a very empty place, I'd imagine. Because the majority simply isn't strict, unless they have a benefit from it.

And hey, say a plague rolls over your area and meat is scarce. You'll survive on carb-loaded rations. As soon as the crisis is averted, you go back to normal eating. You wouldn't have been carnivore for that time? So it's not just a lifestyle to you, but also dependent on circumstances? 

Let's leave it at that. I'm not good at arguing, and you want to call out bs, without noticing that you are standing knee-deep in dung. IMO. 

I only have one question. *Why redefine the word, just for humans? What's the deal?*

I don't care either way. Diet should be about health, not labels. I'll gladly leave this sub if it becomes about strict carnivore. I never enjoyed fanatics. Never understood them.

And yeah, I have no clue about zoology. That is the least important point in my entire comment, and the weakest as well. I'm pretty sure that if the oceans were full of fruit and vegetables, sharks and dolphins would eat them.

The salisbury diet was effectively the first carnivore diet. It was prescribed as a treatment and stated that meat will heal you. It also included other foods, but maintained the notion that too many plants could be toxic, depending on the state of the patient.

Many variants of this diet followed, and with it the mantle of ""elimination diet"" to procedurally eliminate foods that are causing trouble. Since a Top down approch isn't feasble in a westerners mixed diet, it had to be from the bottom up.

The Lion diet being the most minimal sustainable. All other notions of carnivore allow for other stuff, if it is deemed healthy by elimination procedures. Unless you put a strict in front of it and for whatever reason exclude some animal products. And then the dairy free variant. And so many more.

The strict variant is neither about healing, nor about biology. If it were about healing, it would allow for non-issue plants as a snack. As long as all nutrition comes from animals.

If it were about biology, well. then we aren't carnivore at all. We don't even need to eat meat.

I suppose that I have to concede. My definition of Carnivore isn't definitive. But neither is yours. Or anyones. Apart from the Biology one, perhaps.

Please stop spouting off about what you know nothing about.

I don't think you know anything about ""the strict variant"" because what you have said is entirely incorrect. Being strict is precisely what is required in the initial stages to stop the perpetual cycle of inflammation so that one's body can begin to heal. If one doesn't have particular problems, then just elimination of processed foods, garbage oils, and all sugars can do wonders.

>If it were about biology, well. then we aren't carnivore at all. We don't even need to eat meat.

I went from a diet that was poisoning myself and the other members of my Tribe to a diet that has healed my autoimmune issues, reversed my trend towards diabetes, fixed all my blood work values, and as a bonus I have lost weight, sleep great now, and improved my mental health and clarity. How are these changes not biological or entirely based in biology? All I changed was my diet and everything about my health improved to the point I now need no medications or supplements.

1. elimination of carbs which has an enormous hormonal impact and counters hyperinsulinemia, which can prevent people from burning stored fat because insulin is a fat storage hormone.  This is why honey and milk are counter productive.  Cancer also feeds only on glucose, not ketone bodies, so eliminating carbs (and fasting) helps prevent uncontrollable malignancies.
2. nutrient bioavailability which means you don't need to supplement things like vitamin c which competes with glucose for absorption.
3. the elimination of phytotoxins (lectins, oxalate, etc) that cause autoimmune disorders, kidney stones, and may contribute to cancer.  They also can block absorption of micronutrients.

Cancer cannot make use of ketone bodies which are what fuel us when we do not CONSUME carbohydrates but are absent when we do.

The body can run on alcohol too but it is far from optimal.  And just like carbohydrates which it must deal with quickly to rid the blood stream before they wreak havoc, to an even greater extent the body must metabolize and get rid of alcohol so it prioritizes metabolizing it first.

I'm doing it also for overall health like you, and not just to lose weight, so I started at Lion diet and have been slowly introducing things after the first 1.5 weeks to see how it affects my conditions. I hope to get at least through most of the meats and seafood (already found that dungeness crab specifically causes an issue with me), to eggs, then to dairy of some kind. Fingers crossed I can introduce at least some spices and no-carb, no preservative, no filler, hot sauces.

With the newfound energy and focus I'm actually excited to get more physical activity, my conditions are already improving so it may be soon, and the work projects are coming to a close somewhat soon. I hope to mostly do weights, I really loathe cardio for cardio sake. Maybe I'll trick myself in cardio but using a VR helmet and a VR platform/treadmill.",

ln3qqin,t1_ln3ne0q,1fgmtfj,"If I eat breakfast it’s typically eggs and bacon. If I eat lunch Its usually hamburger meat. Usually a couple burger patties with a pad of butter under a slice of cheese. If I’m out and hungry I’ll stop at Wendy’s and get 2-3 large patties. They’re cheap and 100% beef. For dinner I’ll either do a roast in the instapot, taco bowls, chicken with scratch made Alfredo sauce or steak.  If I didn’t have to feed my wife, I could easily skate by on one meal a day and just water.  Anytime I get a craving I just tear into some pork rinds. They’re a staple in our house and the salt kills any sweet cravings.  

Probably my biggest contributor has been cutting out all carbs and sugars. I still do coffee in the morning but I’ll do it black with a stevia sweetener or with heavy cream. I drink about a gallon of water a day with electrolytes almost everyday now. Before, I was lucky to drink a gallon of water in a month. 

The first week I was down 8lbs. Granted that was a lot of water weight from carbs but seeing the number fall on the scale had me hooked. I’ve hit a plateau at the moment but my measurements are still declining so I know I’m still moving towards my goal. I don’t count anything. I just eat until I’m full and make sure I’m getting enough fat. 

I wish you the best of luck on your journey. Believe me when I say that if I can do it, anyone can do it.",

lnu81kq,t1_lnu725w,1fgmtfj,Everyone is a little different but for me the first two weeks were so so. Your body is adjusting to no carbs and that causes your gallbladder to produce more bile. If you’re constipated you need to increase your fat and water intake. You can also take a 400mg Magnesium supplement to keep you regular. If you’ve got the runs then try cutting back on some fat until your body adjust. Some call this adjustment “Keto Flu”. The sooner you ditch the carbs and adjust the better off you’ll be. Week three I was almost back to normal. Now I’m completely normal but a lot less frequent.  Hope you get it straightened out sooner than later.,

ln6mn10,t1_ln3qqin,1fgmtfj,Anytime you hit a plateau There is a very simple fix to this. I have done it myself. I am a one year carnivore. Started at 390 currently 240. At every point when I would hit a plateau I did a three day a.k.a. 72 hour water fast. I definitely put electrolytes in my water during that entire span. Not only will you see the weight absolutely shred off of you if you do the 72 hour water fast maybe once a month but you will reap some amazing health benefits beyond the weight loss. A 72 hour water fast will cause your body to start a autophagy. Look into that it is absolutely game changing. Does all kind of wonders inside of your body cleans your actual mitochondria. Resets your gut biome. Just look into it trust me he will absolutely love it. You are on the right path. Keep it going.,

ln8klwa,t1_ln6mn10,1fgmtfj,I’ll have to give this a try. Thanks!,
ln8uxce,t1_ln6mn10,1fgmtfj,So I have a question regarding your 72 hour water fast. Do you do anything to prep for it?  I’ve never gone beyond 36 hours.,
lnu8heo,t1_lnu8aek,1fgmtfj,Added the magnesium supplement to my response too. It will help keep you regular if you’re getting constipated.,
ln3t8eb,t1_ln36mut,1fgmtfj,"Ya its funny how that works, scale stays the same but get more chiseled it's great. My only word of advice is that if you don't supplement with your electrolytes I would start. That was my only regret is not doing it earlier. My calfs started cramping like crazy around the 4 month mark and I was dehydrated no matter how much water I drank.
Mind you I do a lot of working out and jiu jitsu but once I implimented celtic sea salt, potassium and magnesium it helped tremendously.",
ln8x5ny,t1_ln8uxce,1fgmtfj,"I guess I could say that I prep, but to me prepping basically, just means to be extremely strict carnivore leading up into the fast. It is very important to not have any carbs or any sugar in your body for the few days leading up to the fast. During the entire entirety of this year and through all my fasting and everything for the most part, I’m pretty strict carnivore but I definitely have had my cheat meals every once in a while and it is a massive difference when I have had any carbs or any sugar in my body leading up to a fast, it was damn near impossible to go to 72 hours. Once I started to buckle down and make sure that I had zero carbs zero sugar leading up to the fast, it made the 72 hours ago pretty easily. So if you’re already extremely strict carnivore, you don’t really need to do anything just stay strict leading up to the fast. If you’re eating things like sauces and seasonings and stuff like that, they may have a little tiny bit of sugar and a little bit of carbs then I would definitely cut those in at least 48 hours leading up to the fast so it will go smooth and a hell of a lot easier",
lnu8ki6,t1_lnu8heo,1fgmtfj,"Will keep that in mind, thank you!",
ln43eq7,t1_ln3t8eb,1fgmtfj,"Good advice!  I do supplement electrolytes,  magnesium and Omega 3-6-9.",
ln90zd6,t1_ln8x5ny,1fgmtfj,I’ve been pretty strict with the exception of stevia sweetener in my coffee in the mornings. I’ll cut the coffee and caffeine for a couple days before I start. Thanks again!,
ln9eroq,t1_ln90zd6,1fgmtfj,"Sounds like you got it down. One quick note, though, as far as caffeine goes. This already works for me pretty easy but I see a lot of people struggle with the whole coffee issue because no one really likes playing coffee most people like caffeine. Always messed up my stomach anyway so I have never been an actual coffee drinker, but what I discovered is extremely cheap to have caffeine every day that does not come with normal things with caffeine have. I go to Walmart and buy a bottle of stay awake. It is like four dollars a bottle 200 pills. Each pill is 200 mg of caffeine. Nothing else is inside of it. I take these every single about 30 minutes after I wake up and get some sun. I have tons of energy throughout the day without any repercussions from the hurting my stomach or drinking an energy drink that has a bunch of other crap in it. Just something to consider you don’t have caffeine. You don’t want caffeine pills as an extremely cheap and efficient way to still have caffeine and not worry about all the side effects. I have taken the entire time and lost a ton of weight had no negative repercussions on me.",

A friend of mine is in the same boat. She can’t stick to keto because her husband keeps ordering fast food, which derails her. It’s tough, and I understand.

m7mlt8a,t3_1i3ddg0,1i3ddg0,"Maybe she feels that your carnivore journey started out of the blue and it worried her because in her mind it can only mean you are trying to impress someone else. When someone does a 180 for no apparent reason, it is a bit scary because it can make you feel like you don’t know the other person at all, or they live a double life. She might have felt blindsided.

When you started on carnivore, is it something you pondered for a while - and shared with her - or was it a quick decision? Were you already on a health journey beforehand, or did you switch to carnivore from a junk food diet?

Since she admitted she is suspicious of you, I can only assume her sabotaging is conscious. If you have repeatedly told her that you are doing carnivore to beat your sugar addiction and she still doesn’t believe you, that stems from her own insecurity.

IMO the only way out of this is communication. Make her see that you have been worried about your health for a long time, even if you didn’t always share it with her. Reassure her that there is no side chick. Tell her that her sabotaging efforts make you feel as if she doesn’t care about your health and it hurts.",

I think when you're married, and you guts have spent the last X amount of years together doing the same shit, eating the same shit, having sinilat outlooks on life that're the same....it hits different when one of the partners decide to switch things up. 

My advice, give her time. Don't show, boast, brag or even mention anything about your dieting or want of a lifestyle change. I'm not saying you are, but try not to.

m7monmu,t3_1i3ddg0,1i3ddg0,"From another site:

>Partners can subtly sabotage each other's diets in several ways:

* Bringing home tempting foods: Purchasing or preparing unhealthy snacks and treats that are difficult for the dieting partner to resist.
* Using food as affection: Surprising the dieting partner with indulgent meals or treats as a gesture of love.
* Proposing unhealthy food options: Consistently suggesting less healthy alternatives for meals or snacks2.
* Colluding with diet breaks: Going along with or encouraging small diet concessions, like having ice cream ""just this once"".
* Discouraging healthy habits: Subtly discouraging activities that support weight loss, such as not driving the partner to weight loss support groups.
* Creating food-centric social situations: Organizing gatherings or outings that revolve around eating, making it challenging to stick to a diet.
* Expressing exaggerated concern: Commenting that the dieting partner is ""wasting away"" or losing too much weight too quickly.
* Guilt-tripping: Making the dieting partner feel guilty for not participating in shared food experiences4.
* Leaving tempting foods visible: Placing unhealthy snacks in plain sight rather than storing them out of view.
* Unconsciously maintaining the status quo: Engaging in behaviors that keep the relationship dynamics unchanged, often without realizing it.

I stopped because he was worried about my health and asked me to stop (he also wouldn’t eat just meat and animal-based foods), but I kept doing research on the carnivore diet off and on. 

I ended up restarted it three weeks ago because I dealt with two thyroid crises within a 3 month period (even with medications) that almost landed me in the ER. I also missed how good eating this way made me feel. He expressed concerns again, but I chose to stick with it. He noticed my energy has increased dramatically, my Hashimoto symptoms are starting to improve some, and my long history of severe depression has greatly improved. He decided to start this woe with me this past week; he has type two diabetes (takes metformin for it) and was recently told by his Dr that he was going to end up on insulin if he didn’t make some changes to his diet (he’s very carb addicted).

I never felt I reacted in any way that would confirm I had the intention on cheating on her, and she never said it was a reason to our divorce.

m7mzru1,t1_m7lyrte,1i3ddg0,"Agreed. Just because someone makes an investment in their health and the way they look, doesn't mean they want to move on. However if their other halves reaction is bitter resentment, then they may want to reconsider.",

However, she is obese although pretty active with her dog walking business. She has terrible allergies that she has to treat twice a year with multitudes of drugs and lots of tissue. She has arthritis. Her dad died of Alzheimer’s and her brother has Parkinson’s. So for my money she is walking right into both chronic pain and autoimmune conditions in her future. 

She has started eating a little fish when she finds a source that conforms to her sustainability values. I think if she would eat fish, take fish oil, not eat any seed oils, give up gluten and eat eggs and cheese she could do a pescatarian version of carnivore. I just hope she gets on board soon. 

The good news her brother read that carnivore can help Parkinson’s and heard that my partner and I are succeeding at carnivore so he’s going on it this year! Yay! Carnivore is penetrating our communities. I love it!",

I’d always go back for seconds, and when the dinning staff asked why I wasn’t ordering dessert and I said it’s because I prefer meat to dessert, they started bringing me [triple portions](https://global.discourse-cdn.com/tnation/original/4X/8/b/4/8b4467a0b55348e5a3552a764b86b98e2a7d1869.jpeg) at dinner, so that was awesome.

I legit just ate until I physically couldn’t, walked around with a 8 month pregnant food baby until it went away, then ate again, and ended up [very beach ready](https://global.discourse-cdn.com/tnation/original/4X/9/4/6/946149f8624a67f68ec556587efb1ff039407372.jpeg) on day 6, because apparently, when all you give the body to eat is a bunch of protein and fat, it gets VERY anabolic. 

I also bought the [perfect t-shirt](https://global.discourse-cdn.com/tnation/original/4X/9/c/2/9c2994fcd057d634e7149cf4f377222d0471d39e.jpeg) on the ship.",

My body felt great and it was amazing in that regard. My brain didn't like it at all.

Most people counter that it's great for seizure illnesses as that is what a particular form of keto is used for. That's just not how it works for my disorder though.

I do liberal low carb because I do realize the benefits. Doing something is better than nothing when it comes to trying to keep carbs down. It's a tricky line to walk. Some days are better than others. 

Example - on good days the net carbs sitting at 65-79 a day is ok. On bad days 80-99 is best.

>I ask because I’ve been on it for about two months to lose weight (lifting intensely and doing zone 2 cardio) but haven’t seen much progress.

That's because you need to HEAL first.  A metabolically damaged body is not going to lose fat, because fat is precious for survival and the body will cling to it in times of stress.  That is a body that is surviving.  You want a body to be thriving.  Once there, it will lose fat.

When I started eating this way, I ate when I was hungry and stopped when I wasn't.  I relearned hunger and satiety, because those traits were damaged.  I stuck with meat and eggs.  I had VERY limited dairy.  I avoided seasonings and all other plants.  I healed, and I got lean.",

That will halt muscular hypertrophy as the body optimises for the situation (unless it's what you want), so let's say you decided to improve your long-distance running capability, you'd start doing runs for vast distances, and you'd become optimised for that activity.

I recommend machines over free weights as you don't need a spotter, especially when done correctly. The best machines are variable resistance: meaning they follow your joint and muscle function and have varied pressure throughout the movement. With free weights, you're burdened by a static weight; with variable resistance, the weight changes along the movement. This will allow you to work your muscles to their maximum capacity instead of being limited by your weakest muscles, which are usually at the start of the movement. Push-ups are a great demonstration of this limitation: in the top of the movement, you're at your strongest as the muscle is under tension and extended, and below the movement, when you're close to touching the ground, you're at your weakest as the muscle is contracting in place. Invariably, you can push more at the top of the movement, but if you can't do it at the bottom, then you're not able to do any push-ups, and you're not tapping into your potential for hypertrophy.

I've read two fantastic exercise science books: Body By Science by Doug McGuff and John Little; Weightlifting Is a Waste of Time by John Jaquish. This is why I know so much, and I've also listened to exercise scientists and physicians, such as Dr Paul Mason and Professor Bart Kay, and bodybuilders on the carnivore diet.",

I treated it as an elimination diet, and I found out sugar had no bearing whatsoever on my health problems, but If I have any fresh plants whatsoever my problems flare up. 

Also, according to every single study (except one) on the isotopes of bones of pre-agricultural humans, we ate nothing but meat. And that one study of a single site showed that we ate NEARLY nothing but meat:

There is apparently scientific studies to back up their findings. I know alot don't want to believe this and downvote me for it. But I didn't do the studies and this is not my conclusions its medical fact.

Dr Westman, Dr Berry and Dr Georgia Ede have all talked about the studies that the liver can only process 20g of carbs a day.

m8egkv3,t1_m8dmilo,1i68zua,"That article says we ate MOSTLY meat.  You should look into Weston Price's work- he travelled the world visiting tribes and communities in far off places and analyzed their diets. Probably the most through examination of what we ate as humans. He said the same thing- mostly meat and or/eggs/raw dairy- but mostly meat is not 100 percent meat. 

The majority of the diet was meat- or raw dairy and eggs in some cases like the Masai and others- but most people  did eat small amounts of fermented foods, fruit when they could get it (which was most likely less sweet and in season), insects, medicinal plants, in winter times tubers, and alcohol made from cassava and various grains and honey. The Inuit in traditional societies  are really the only people who ate one hundred percent meat. 

Nuts were referred to as starvation food by many Indian tribes but they did eat them, as there were many long winters and disappearing game to hunt.",
ma0wdnu,t1_m8dmilo,1i68zua,"That's absolutely not what that study says. Our main source of protein was animals. That's got nothing to do with where we got our calories. The study specifically calls that out.

Neanderthals were mostly eating from the land and as homo sapiens introduced fish into their diet. But the measure used can only detect protein sources, not carbs or fats.",
m8fvtuq,t1_m8fgtg3,1i68zua,"Well, in those books, the arguments against cardio are substantiated by studies. From what I looked up, they are valid. Walking isn't necessarily cardio in the mainstream sense and doesn't trigger so many deleterious effects, as it shouldn't. Our ancestors used to walk continuously, so it cannot be bad for us. Otherwise, it would have shown up long ago.

I did sprints routinely a couple months ago but stopped due to the ensuing winter. It's impractical and too risky to run at the highest intensity. However, I'm seeing more improvements, and faster, with the X3 in just three weeks of doing the programme. It works, and it's a lot better than free weights.",

I bothered to actually read the studies of those isotopes of ancient human remains- in every single one- except one- we were further away from omnivores and herbivores than lions and wolves. The one study of one site showed we ate a little bit of plants, but it was very little and only at that one site. You're should actually be reading those studies and looking at our morphology.

After 6 years doing the carnivore diet I’m not convinced anybody would have any ketones at all if they eat fruit. Even the smallest amount. I’ve tracked mine, my boyfriends and a friend’s ketones over the years. 

If I eat a normal but strict carnivore diet my ketones are around 0.5- 1. This isn’t overthinking it, eating red meat, bacon, chicken, and eggs. Chaffee, laura Spath, Ken berry etc have all said they sit at around 0.5. They’re all pretty strict.

Price did go to areas where wooly mammoths were- he travelled all over North America. Personally, those times were so far away and it seems like archeology is divided these days between many different histories and suppressed science. Not sure how just one study would convince me. I have family that eat a very basic animal based diet they have been eating for thousands of years- the health of those people is unparalleled. And they eat tubers in the winter, as well as preserved meat. 

As an herbalist as well, I believe plants are medicinal. No culture in the world just sits down and eats leafy greens as a salad, I get it. It
But I think mostly meat is mostly meat- Price never said humans should eat one hundred percent meat. He also advocated for raw dairy and raw butter and saw no problem with the addition of fermented vegetables and seasonal fruit that wasn't bred to be super sweet. 

. I personally think there's a whole spectrum of healthy eating, one end of the spectrum is the Weston Price side, for someone with a healthy gut biome and no autoimmune illnesses - grains and beans and nuts properly soaked , vegetables, fermented, or prepared traditionally, fruit in season- and then many other end of the spectrum is full lion diet. I think if most people can find where they are on this spectrum, they will lead a healthy life. And for the record- I'm carnivore.",

m8j2cn9,t1_m8j22b2,1i68zua,Thanks 💖  what do you think is better for ketosis tallow or butter?,💖
m8fxmrn,t1_m8fl4un,1i68zua,"Yeah I read every single study on the isotopes of ancient human remains I could find- there is even a meta study on it- and as far as I can tell, we did not evolve to eat plants for a long, long time. 

The reason I became carnivore was because I was studying our morphology and got stuck on the fact that our stomach acid levels are between a carnivore and a scavenger- it threw me off because herbivores and omnivores need less acidic stomach acid levels in order to ferment the plants and extract the nutrients. Carnivores, and especially scavengers, need much higher acidity levels to kill off parasites. 

I took the zoological approach- there is just one diet that is optimal for a given species, and that is what they evolved on.

I look at like this- there is an optimal diet, then there is a less optimal- but tolerable- diet, then there is unhealthy diets. Animals that can ferment plants can destroy those antinutrients (oxalates, tartrates etc) that bind to your iron, calcium carbonate etc and wreak havoc, much like water rusting metal, on your cells. Fermented foods like kombucha destroys most of the oxalates, but they don't destroy them all, so our body has to lose nutrients we evolved on to fight back those tartrates.

Here's a copy/paste I keep for Carnivores new to the scene, but it's hasn't been updated. There's Moncriff with his book, ""The Philosophy of the Stomach; or, An Exclusively Animal Diet"" written in 1856, dr. Kiltz, dr. O'mara, and some others I did not include that made some interesting observations:

I was recently asked for my research. Here's a collection of some of the more poignant parts. There are other doctors and other studies, but I didn't want to get too overwhelming.

Check out the harvard carnivore diet study authors- Dr. Ludwig was a Harvard professor of Pediatrics and a Harvard professor of Nutrition, as well as a Boston Children’s Hospital researcher. Also, prior to the study, he was anti-red meat. The other authors are also Harvard professors and/or Boston Children’s Hospital researchers. They also collected data using the Redcap database system, which wasn't cheap- ""Prohibitively expensive for smale scale studies."" It was built by Vanderbilt University, to collect medical records from labs etc. It was about $1,000 a month at the time to use it. Bloodwork is included on page 7.

Doctors who came to all meat diets from different approaches:

  Dr. James H. Salisbury (1823-1905) did it by experimenting on himself in the 1850s. He originally started with a beans only diet, which ended three days in. See his book The Relation of Ailmentation and Disease. 

  Dr. Natasha Campbell-Mcbride (1961-present) (neurologist) slowly figured it out over years, eventually coming up with the No Plants Gaps Diet for psychological health. 

  Dr. Shawn Baker (1967-present) came up with it while experimenting  on himself and others, looking to prepare his patients for surgery. Then they started canceling the surgeries. He currently holds a very recent world record for indoor rowing for all age groups.

  Dr. Chaffee (1979-present) came up with it because of his botanical knowledge, looking at the insecticides and pesticides that plants naturally make. He came to this conclusion through his professor, whose name was lost to time.

  Dr. Blake Donaldson (1892-1966) came to it through anthropology. See his book Strong Medicine. The preface was written by a surgeon who wrote that he was very impressed with the results of Dr. Donaldsons' patients.

  Not a doctor, but Vilhjalmur Stefansson was a harvard professor who did the first trial in the 1920s, after having to live off of an entirely animal based diet with the Inuit.

Dr. Weston A. Price (1870-1948) came to it through dentistry, examining various indigenous people who have birthed and raised children on native diets vs European ones. See the foundation, and the case he presents, here: https://www.westonaprice.org/health-topics/nutrition-greats/weston-a-price-dds/#gsc.tab=0
 
Then there are the case studies at paleomedicina.com on cancers which utilizes 70-100% animal based diets. Be careful with that though, because of the BRAF V600E mutation.

There is also the studies on the isotopes of bones of pre-agricultural humans, which clearly show across the board that we at very little to no plants whatsoever.

m8lmuqx,t1_m8fxp1o,1i68zua,I'm glad it's working for you. I'd love to have one. I might rather build a calisthenics gym in my backyard for the price tho,
m8j2quu,t1_m8j2cn9,1i68zua,Tallow but you’ll achieve high numbers with butter as well. It’s the quantity of fat to protein. If you want to be in nutritional ketosis try for 80% from animal fat. Doesn’t really matter which fat.,
m8j4wnz,t1_m8j2cn9,1i68zua,"https://preview.redd.it/f71vahbfpjee1.jpeg?width=4032&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=ecd2a82739d72aeb33108f5c33a59bfbf0ea81c3

I’d suggest you eat very fatty meat, these are the lamb chops I eat and add butter as a sauce. If you did that and didn’t eat any other dairy I reckon your ketones would be 2-3 in about a week. Nutritional ketosis starts around 2.4 with maintaining blood glucose at 4 (which would happen with zero carbs).

Actually, not much 500g of wild meat Kangaroo is about 10$-12$

And beef fat 500g under 3$ 

So I'd say 90 to 130$ a week. Sometimes, even less if I'm fasting to cut weight",

lfkyuar,t1_lfje5vi,1eeohxt,"Thanks, my friend.  Yes, sure, i just eat game meat ( kangaroo) and some beef fat crackers for fat intake, that's it . Occasionally, salmon and beef organs like tripe. And I don't eat at all if I miss gym if I'm recovered enough from workouts. Just eat till you are full stick to a balanced workout routine with weight training and cardio. You'll  be good",
lfg5jp3,t1_lfg59te,1eeohxt,"Yes my friend 
Muscularity depends on how hard you train and your genetics. Carnivore diet takes care of the adequate nutrient and recovery",

lfgnkl1,t1_lfgn5fo,1eeohxt,Thank you so much  Lili,
lfh1daj,t1_lfh0rvq,1eeohxt,I mainly eat kangaroo or other wild meats with beef fat crackers.. occasionally I do ad a bit of anchovies wild cought salmon or beef tripe.,
lfh14el,t1_lfh0rvq,1eeohxt,What's your height and weight? what body % do you know you currently at?,
lfhkfp8,t1_lfhj4ll,1eeohxt,"Yes! I do weighted stair master for 30+ minutes about 5 days, and on top of that 10k steps, 7 days. And weight training in the evening.  But it's not necessary to do as much. I just happened to have a lot of free time to spare. For instance, my day off yesterday , I did about 8 hours training for the first time. And still alot of energy to spare",
lfhkppd,t1_lfhj9b3,1eeohxt,"Thanks, my friend. It's simple, just kangaroo and beef fat pieces. Occasionally, salmon  or tripe. That's it",
lfhmde8,t1_lfhkhvw,1eeohxt,"Yes, I did. But I managed to get right back on track, but the important thing is to remind  ourselves that being weak minded or giving up  when things are hard isn't ever ok. Because once we get past the hard phase, things get a lot smooth and better than ever was",
lfhmf2m,t1_lfhkhvw,1eeohxt,Thanks my friend,

lfik2k4,t1_lfijzhs,1eeohxt,Thanks my friend,
lfkzbyj,t1_lfjpcu4,1eeohxt,"Thanks my friend .Yes, that's why I buy lean meat and fat separately.  Wild kangaroo meat has almost no fat, and then I buy the beef fat separately from the butcher. I posted a picture of it somewhere",

lgegh6v,t1_lgefxiu,1eeohxt,"You don't need to track calories until  you hit a real plateau.
So meanwhile enjoy Ur food and keep working out . Balanced training of cardio and weights, which I assume you are already doing?",
lffx06y,t1_lffvlf7,1eeohxt,"Thanks. Well, I mainly eat kangaroo and other game meats because they don't get fed corn and other crap, and I get beef fat from the butcher and make beef crackers. My protein to fat ratio is like 65/35 . 

I work out mostly 2 times a day. I do weighted stair master with  20kg weighted west  in the morning  about  30 minutes, no breaks, and no holding. 
And pm I do weight training for about 2 to hours and during the day  I do about 10k steps walking (not including weighted cardio).
 
Still  don't seem to run out of energy, though",

lfht6kf,t1_lfhmde8,1eeohxt,Well said my friend 💪🏻,💪🏻
lfht814,t1_lfhmde8,1eeohxt,What’s your go to meals? Just out of curiosity :),
lfi7117,t1_lfi6s21,1eeohxt,Which cardio?,
lfl51su,t1_lfkzbyj,1eeohxt,That sounds delectable. What does wild kangaroo meat taste like? I've never tried it!,
lflb9uk,t1_lfl1n1y,1eeohxt,"Really, I know it sounds crazy; but I had a friend that was going bald and he took pictures of his balding head. He went to Thailand where a man was offering very violent head massages for $1.50. Since the massages were cheap; he got one every day. His hair had grown back-in within a month with the violent head massages (due to increased blood flow). 

Also a derma roller grows back hair by rolling it on scalp. It’s a bunch of tiny needles on a wheel 🛞 that you roll around on zigzagging-zigzag motion and cross patch motion (again improves blood flow which grows hair). Some women use the derma roller to regrow their eyebrows. It works. Don’t buy any of the chemicals they try to sell you. Just do it natural; plain and simple. Dip the derma roller in alcohol to disinfect and in water before use.",🛞
lflmc7b,t1_lflh4cg,1eeohxt,Awesome! Congrats 👍🏼,👍🏼

Also, I have about 3 friends who become carnivore after seeing me.but most importantly, my mum went from 75 to 52kg and got better from arthritis, bursitis, which was due for surgery,  and gum disease. And now she is physically active and looks great.she is in her 60s.",
lfg01zx,t1_lffxx47,1eeohxt,"Also, I get roid accusations from some ppl.",
lfgxcpe,t1_lfgx513,1eeohxt,True. Sadly,
lfhmp47,t1_lfhm3iu,1eeohxt,All the best.and feel better soon,
lfh1gy7,t1_lfh1f9r,1eeohxt,Then just maintain on carnivore diet goin forward,
lfh2ly3,t1_lfh1f9r,1eeohxt,"Well, calorie surplus with more fat might help. I buy some beef fat from the butcher, cut em into small pieces, make crackers, and eat like popcorn when I try to ad weight and its way too delicious... But if you are on carbs, u gonna.lose alot of water weight first.  And it sure is hard to bulk on this diet. Just like it's hard to lose weight on a carb diet",
lfh4fj6,t1_lfh1f9r,1eeohxt,"Although from 79 to 84 means 5 kilo bulk, and what % would be muscle out 5kg? And when u cut down to 10%, how much muscle u may lose? How much muscle will you get to keep?  And why not try to add lean mass with carnivore instead of carb, water weight?",
lfkwbmo,t1_lfitinu,1eeohxt,"Yes, I still do count calories and do fasting if I want to get leaner.  I try to fast if I'm not active. 

 But all that isn't necessary unless you are trying to break a plateu. Just eat until u r no longer hungry.",
lfhtn5u,t1_lfht6kf,1eeohxt,Thanks brother,
lfhv8c9,t1_lfht814,1eeohxt,"Well, i would love some sea food mix with ribye with melted yolks on top of it... or you mean? Like a cheat meal? Would be Chinese or srilankan fried rice . But I cheat less and less because I don't feel food afterwards",
lfi7u14,t1_lfi7117,1eeohxt,Mainly stair master for 30 minutes 5 days with 20kg weighted vest  and 10k steps on top if,
lfl6apr,t1_lfl51su,1eeohxt,"Haha, it's pure red meat and almost no fat, kind of like venison. Taste isn't the best because it is no fat .but very high in nutrition.",
lflgycm,t1_lflb9uk,1eeohxt,Thanks. I appreciate it. Will give it a go.,
lflmenb,t1_lflmc7b,1eeohxt,Thx my friend,
lfg8kqz,t1_lfg7t6j,1eeohxt,"It fluctuates. If I miss work out 1 day, then I will not eat at all on that day. But in general, what I eat is  kangaroo  meat 500 to 700g a day depends on how hungry I am. And some beef crackers just eat until u r not hungry. Eat more fat if u feel a lack of energy or low sex drive",
lfie2w4,t1_lfidvr0,1eeohxt,Yes in general,
lfk05u4,t1_lffz3px,1eeohxt,"It's amazing how we could stop aging but no one cares. Everyone is after some kind of manufactured biohack, but it's just about good old meat, butter and eggs.",
lfg2yxn,t1_lfg01zx,1eeohxt,And I'm assuming those are false accusations?  It's difficult because of all the roided influencers. It kind of blurs the line for people of what's possible naturally.,
lfmag3j,t1_lfgxcpe,1eeohxt,Wish I'd known sooner :(,
lfh7ms9,t1_lfh4fj6,1eeohxt,"Thats what am
Wondering what u eat in a day to maintain your physique, i always drop weight fast soon as go on carnivore and obviously lose some muscle too even tho im at gym daily",
lfg9b2u,t1_lfg8kqz,1eeohxt,"And when I want to get leaner, I go for long fasting periods and do more cardio, and cut down some calories from fat. I wouldn't recommend cutting fat intake like me, though, if u have an active sex life.cutting fat cause ED but temporary. It comes back  once u eat well again.",
lfiym5r,t1_lfie2w4,1eeohxt,Do you feel good eating that lean of a diet? I like seeing new perspective as most carnivores preach 70-80% calories from fat.,
lfl00xz,t1_lfk05u4,1eeohxt,"Very true. Sadly, people are being taught that meat is bad and veggies are healthy and they believe it like a religion.",
lfg4d6u,t1_lfg2yxn,1eeohxt,Never had any PEDs. Perhaps  I'll take a blood test and post it here if it helps anyone.,
lfmajjq,t1_lfmag3j,1eeohxt,"It's okay, though shaved head isn't bad if you are in shape",
lfh8ctn,t1_lfh7ms9,1eeohxt,"Just red meat protrin 65% and 35% fat from beef fat. That's it. I just eat till I'm no longer hungry. Right now Im trying to cut further, so I eat about once every 24 to 36 hours, depending on my workout schedule",
lfie89s,t1_lfg9b2u,1eeohxt,"Yeah cutting fat intake too low seems to tank your hormones. I'm prioritising leaner meats for weight loss as well, no downsides so far. I guess it's still high fat compared to average diet",
lfkxxui,t1_lfiym5r,1eeohxt,"Well, I feel good overall, but I feel my testosterone goes down when I'm eating a low fat %. So it's not ideal if you have an active sex life. But once I up, the fat intake that issue gets fixed almost immediately. 

I'm not sure about 70% fat intake. My regular intake is about 65% protein, 35% fat , and i never had any issues with testosterone at that ratio. Right now, I'm cutting further, so my fat intake is even less. I'm eating mainly lean protein. That definitely has sent my testosterone down.",

lmhhw1l,t1_lmhekvx,1fdjnw2,"Thank you! Typical day would be 3 strips of bacon and black coffee with a heaping of butter and a small amount of heavy cream for breakfast. If I'm hungry for lunch, I do half a pound of ground beef cooked with butter and salt. I keep pork rinds and chomps beef sticks around for snacks. And dinner is usually a seared ribeye and 4 over medium eggs, cooked with more butter and salt. Ribeye is my absolute favorite, I could eat it all day every day",

lmir85f,t1_lmi8pfz,1fdjnw2,"Thank you! My body was bloated and inflamed from my previous diet. Since I've done carnivore, the inflammation has gone away, giving me the appearance of a ""flatter"" stomach. As for the tightness I do transverse abdominal breathing and isolated core exercises that's how I closed my diastasis recti from pregnancy, such as bird dogs, dead bugs, glute bridges, single leg taps and others you can google them! That's how I closed my diastasis recti from pregnancy, and I'm assuming how my core has remained strong while it was hiding under my belly fat previously",

lmmyz1a,t1_lmjq1h2,1fdjnw2,"I wanted a Greek mythology tattoo for no real reason except that I enjoy reading books and studying art about it. So there's Aphrodite, Persephone, Pegasus, and Cerberus. I want to add the goddess Selene and a manticore (if there's space)",

lmn7exq,t1_lmmywsd,1fdjnw2,"It will be a good reminder of all the hard work you put it. Congrats! 

I've been mostly staying on track with carni for years, but I can tell you that, for me, it ain't easy and can get quite monotonous.  I keep plugging away one day at a time and keep reminding myself that I don't want to go back to the way things were before.",
lmkp79r,t1_lmir85f,1fdjnw2,"Thanks for the reply, again amazing results on your stomach. Sounds like hard work and it paid off. I lost quite some weight, but my stomach is where the last of the fat is. 

Not to mention all the stretch marks, can't get over the fact how good your stomach looks after a pregnancy. I will look into those exercises!",
lmhldtm,t1_lmhkmkc,1fdjnw2,Really awesome result.,
lmrax22,t1_lmglec4,1fdjnw2,The tattoo is cool btw!,
lmnoiun,t1_lmn7exq,1fdjnw2,"That's how my husband feels. He gets so bored so easily and leans more towards a keto lifestyle, adding in berries and fruits. I think this was just finally ""my thing."" I can eat ribeye and eggs all day every day. But I definitely know the feeling you speak of because that's how I would feel on other diets and unfortunately I would always end up breaking down and binge eating.",
lmmy97i,t1_lmkp79r,1fdjnw2,"My arms are holding on to all my fat, I would be so happy if that finally dropped off. And it was sheer luck that I didn't get any stretchmarks on my tummy. I did get some on my thighs and butt though, but already had some in those spots so it didn't bother me too badly to add more.",
lx66m4g,t3_1gri5yr,1gri5yr,"Well done sir! You’re becoming a Greek god! lol 

lol for real tho I know the way of eating can be hard so well done kicking ass and losing the pounds.",
lx7v2hz,t3_1gri5yr,1gri5yr,"Amazing!! I can see the difference!  I wish i took before pics of myself but deep down i thought this wasn’t going to work.  I was dead wrong.  The first time i took a really good look in the mirror after losing about 70 pounds i was blown away.  It’s almost effortless at this point. Keep it up, you’re KILLING IT!! Also, damn dude, those are some beautiful eyes you got.  I don’t know if it’s just the lighting but they really pop in your more recent pic.",

Try different meats and different butters/ghee/animal fats to find out what you like and try recipes to make it fun and enjoyable. Once you've come to terms with the restrictions, then make it stricter, that's what I did and I was happy :) Also good that you're doing it with your husband, I've been doing it with a friend and it's SO helpful having someone to talk about it with and to motivate each other!

It's going to be a hard battle to convince the masses.

It will be the most epic and full proof evidence that will finally shut down everyone who was against the carnivore way of eating.

I know they did a study how air fryers usage is associated with cancer, and they name the acrylamide as the culprit. But the authors of the study noted that it was more associated with food items like French fries (high in carbs) and less associated with meat.


Sugar itself is a causal factor of inflammation and cancer. How much of their findings are just associative links between cancer and sugar, and not so much the acrylamide? ",
lxesz7y,t1_lxe79ju,1grh1uf,Conspiracy horseshit as usual from an anti vaxxer,
lxfmb4c,t1_lxd6tmm,1grh1uf,"The Maillard reaction inherently involves sugars, as browning requires their presence. More sugar means more acrylamide formation. This reaction produces carcinogenic compounds, altering the flavor profile of cooked foods compared to raw, uncooked meat. While sugar plays a role, focusing solely on it overlooks the broader implications. Notably, acrylamide forms when cooking both plant-based foods and meat, as both contain sugars.

The Maillard reaction produces known carcinogens, including polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons, Advanced Glycation End Products, heterocyclic amines, nitrosamines, furfural, nitroaromatics, furan, methylglyoxal, glyoxal and acrylamides. These compounds have been directly linked to cancer, which underscores the significance of minimizing exposure.

Your distinction between in vivo AGE formation and dietary consumption overlooks the fact that ingested AGEs can still cause oxidative stress and inflammation. While sugar’s role in cancer is significant, dismissing the Maillard reaction’s carcinogenic potential overlooks compelling evidence.

The National Toxicology Program classifies acrylamide as “reasonably anticipated to be a human carcinogen.” Similarly, the International Agency for Research on Cancer considers acrylamide “probably carcinogenic to humans.” Studies consistently link dietary AGEs to inflammation, oxidative stress and cancer.

Considering the evidence, it’s crucial to acknowledge the Maillard reaction’s carcinogenic potential. 

How do you reconcile the established carcinogenicity of Maillard reaction compounds with your skepticism? What evidence supports your claim that dietary AGE breakdown in the gut prevents inflammation?",
lxfwzz4,t1_lxfmb4c,1grh1uf,"Skeptism is very ubiquitous in the carnivore community, as the very same health organizations would still associate high cholesterol with cardiovascular disease.


I don't put too much weight on associative studies about Maillard compounds as I would with LDL studies. It's associative and can lead to interesting hypothesis and theories, but anything factual would require the biological mechanism to be proven without a doubt.


The biggest issue, as I said before, but will clarify here, is the confounding factor of sugar consumption, as sugar itself is directly linked to mitochondria dysfunction, and thus cancer. There is actually biological pathways that are known, it's basically glucose oxidation produces more reactive oxygen species, which will cause mitochondria to be damaged.


Because of the highly correlated nature of the maillard consumption with high sugar consumption, it doesn't provide me with enough evidence that maillard alone is worth the concern on its effect on increasing cancer.


And I don't discount it 100%, as I've stated in my 1st comment, even if the theory is true... which means I'm okay with it being true, as I can see the potential of AGE products in dietary consumption may cause oxidative stress. Though I'm not well verse in the process of dietary breakdown of AGE and how it's absorb into the gut, my very rudimentary understanding would be the protein is broken down into its amino acids before its absorb.


The whole AGE causing inflammation is because glycation of whole protein, rendering the protein inactive. While glycated amino acids wouldn't be able to transcribe into finished protein as the glycation of the amino group would prevent it from doing so.


I'm not convinced that dietary AGE would have a major effect on inflammation, though I am open to be wrong if given the biological mechanism.",

I’m not disputing whether Omega 3 is good or not. But Omega 6, which directly contributes to eicosanoids, are generally consumed in higher concentration. Beef tends to have a 9:1 omega 6:3 ratio, and closer to 2:1 if grass fed. But good thing beef is quite low in omegas altogether. As far as cytokines and interleukins, sugar generally doesn’t cause significant inflammation unless over-consumed. There is a population of auto-immune folks that react to sugar negatively (myself). There is also a population that can be negatively affected by high fat (Lupus and Hepatitis folks). 
All in all, I think that the population that benefits from Carnivore, like you and me, have a subset of genetic predispositions. One that some other populations— like East Asia, may not possess for reasons still unknown. I appreciate the polite response, by the way.",

lz19d01,t3_1h00d7r,1h00d7r,"Evidence that scientists were paid by the sugar industry and intentionally manipulated research outcomes came to light through an analysis of internal documents from the 1960s. These documents revealed that the Sugar Research Foundation (SRF) (now the Sugar Association) funded studies that deliberately shifted the narrative to favor sugar.

How was it discovered?

1. Publication in JAMA Internal Medicine (2016): In 2016, a study by Cristin Kearns and colleagues was published, analyzing archival SRF documents. These documents showed that the SRF paid three Harvard scientists, including the prominent Dr. Fredrick Stare, the equivalent of $50,000 in today’s money, to publish a literature review in the prestigious journal New England Journal of Medicine in 1967. This review downplayed evidence linking sugar to heart disease and instead blamed saturated fats.


2. Manipulation of Results:

The published review minimized the role of sugar in cardiovascular disease.

It redirected the blame onto saturated fats as the primary risk factor.

The documents revealed that the SRF provided guidance on the conclusions the researchers were expected to draw, which is a clear violation of research ethics.



3. Impact on Health Policy: As a result, sugar was deemed harmless for decades, while saturated fats were demonized. This influenced dietary guidelines in the U.S. and worldwide, promoting low-fat diets that were often high in sugar. These guidelines likely contributed to the rise of obesity and diabetes.


4. Failure to Disclose Conflicts of Interest: At the time, there was no requirement for researchers to disclose funding sources. As a result, the studies appeared independent, even though they were funded by the sugar industry.



Evidence of Deception:

Letters between the SRF and the researchers contained explicit instructions about the desired conclusions.

The SRF knew sugar could negatively impact health but funded research to obscure this fact.

Key data about sugar's effects on cholesterol and triglycerides, which were known at the time, were omitted from the studies.


Conclusion:

This discovery highlighted how industries can influence science and health policy. The manipulation of 1960s research had far-reaching consequences that are still felt today. Modern studies increasingly show that excessive sugar consumption, not just saturated fats, plays a significant role in heart disease and other chronic conditions.",

The benefit of this is with keto you are blocking the main pathway that causes aging and potentially reducing many age related decline issue. The fact that you didn’t know this just shows that you and your religion have become so disconnected from the science.

I’m curious, when you went carnivore, what exactly did you do?",
lvdn9q5,t1_lvddbox,1gjh75u,"Good to know. I'll be patient then as I'm only a couple weeks into this journey. I do feel less pain due to inflammation in my injured knee, so a win already is great.",
lvinilq,t1_lvi31qf,1gjh75u,"It's interesting what we discover when we finally pay attention. Mine was a combination of sugar, carbs, and seed oils. I'ma say 25% sugar, 25% carbs, 50% seed oils making me unwell. Since having gone to just beef, butter, eggs (and heavy cream for my one cup of coffee), I'm already feeling sooooo much better! My intent is to stick with this WOE for 3 months and see where I'm at and possibly add cheese back in. NGL... I wouldn't mind adding cheese back in TODAY, but at this point, the simplicity of just having 3 items on the menu doesn't feel limiting, it feels freeing - as in I don't have to decide what's for b'fast, lunch, or dinner. (actually eating more of a brunch at 11am and an early dinner at 3 or 4 pm - and... no evening cravings for something crunchy or sweet! yay!) 

I say that because I did pretty strict keto for 4 months 2018/2019 and found it difficult to not go over the recommended daily macros. I did lose weight... about 20#... but at the time did not have all the inflammatory problems I have now (due to injuries), so I didn't notice a difference other than weight. Unfortunately, I love to cook, so I started experimenting with the many enticing keto(ish) recipes - most of which totally wrecked my macros. I kept the 20# off, but struggled staying ""keto."" I finally caved and went back to my usual menu - definitely not SAD as I cook everything from scratch and make an effort to limit sweets to 1x/week. 

Unfortunately, I had a shoulder injury in 2020 and a severe knee injury in 2021 and my activity level went down - way down. Between 2021 and Oct 2024, I slowly gained those 20# back. And the pain from inflammation just got worse, even drudging up an old hip injury (rollerblading) from the late '90s and an ankle injury (cheerleading) from the '80s. What a wreck. I don't want to drag all this unwellness into my 60s! 

Plus, having recently had an aunt pass who suffered from dementia made me deathly afraid of losing \*any\* brain function. What a cruel disease, and most of these memory care places or nursing homes only exasperate the problem by feeding a steady stream of carbs in the form of pastas, bread, potatoes (usually french fries) and sugar! Maddening!

So in part to address the inflammation and in part to address the 20# that crept back into my life (and my fear whenever I couldn't remember a simple word - or an actor's name), I did the thing I knew I would stick to, and that's having the fewest ingredients to work with.

Keep on converting until you’re fully carnivore, then you’ll start seeing results - first few weeks/a month being fully carnivore are always the hardest, but since you were already willing to commit to this diet, you’ll probably have better chances if you start over. Ignore the numbers, just start eating ground beef with eggs and cheese (if you can tolerate eggs/cheese) follow carnivore people on instagram to get recipes for varying dishes if you get bored (I’ve not gotten bored of the ground beef with eggs combo yet) but then again, I know this diet isn’t for everyone. However, I cannot ignore the benefits it provides and want everyone to experience those as well. 
Besides, I think you started carnivore way too hard - when I started, my body could not handle that much fat so I just ate more protein/steak along with supplements of fats here and there, it worked for me, as my body adapted to the additional fat, then my body started burning them for energy. That’s what worked for me, it might work for you.",
lve2yxa,t1_lvdo0kv,1gjh75u,Wow that’s incredible,
lvjmk6m,t1_lvj1sgr,1gjh75u,"Haha. Thanks. I see I went a little off the rails / stream of consciousness writing this morning. 

I had to adopt a whole new mindset: ""Food is for fuel / health, not for entertainment."" Unfortunately, I haven't really developed any creative meals using just those three things... other than the cut of meat (usually ground beef, but also ribeyes - oh, and I've done a chuck roast in the slowcooker) and how I prepare the eggs (poached, overeasy, scrambled - still coming to grips with hardboiled eggs - I don't really find them filling / satisfying).

I wish I had a better answer for you, but that mindset shift made all the difference.",
lvli6hd,t1_lvj1sgr,1gjh75u,Thanks for the suggestions. Every little bit helps. I’ll try the chuck roast in the slow cooker. That sounds good & hubby will like it too. Good luck with your continued weight loss. Keep us posted on your progress. Ok?,
lwp3uk1,t1_lwkb0sf,1gjh75u,"My BMR was tested. My resting metabolism is 4k calories.

Ive followed all the rules for carnivore. Ive basically been carnivore for the last couple years. I stopped eating anything that isnt animal related a while ago.

Its not as simple as just ignore numbers and eat when hungry. I gained 30 lbs in 1 month when I increased my fat like I was told. That shouldnt be possible.

My body has been fat adapted for 8 years since I've bene on keto. Unless it somehow became immune to it.

I mostly eat ground beef and cheese. I'll start eating eggs again when they stop pretending like the bird flu is debilitating them just to gouge us.",
lwqusjj,t1_lwp3uk1,1gjh75u,"The only thing I could think of why you gained weight is because you ate \*too much\* fat - your body need to burn them for energy, but if you are not as active as much as the fat you're eating, the body WILL store them for later. So, maybe look at your activity level and adjust accordingly.",
lwygjla,t1_lwqusjj,1gjh75u,"I figured I over corrected. Problem is, I dont know how much to eat in fat. The only progress I have seen was last year when I started eating stew meat and 2 lb sirloin, all with very little fat and over 300g of protein. I was losing 10 lbs a month, then it suddenly stopped working and I havent gotten it to work since.

Right now I'm eating 88/12 ground beef, cause sirloin is expensive.",
lwyn5de,t1_lwygjla,1gjh75u,"I understand - personally, I don't think there's a magical set amount of what we should eat - I think the important thing is to listen to your body - if that worked for you, start that again, supplement with beef organs to make sure you're nurturing yourself properly, eat salt, drink water... Hopefully it'll work for you again.",

m58u7c9,t1_m58r7bk,1hsugtk,"Make sure to keep consuming electrolytes daily. Also, consider spacing food out more to multiple smaller meals during a day if it's high in fat so that your bile production can keep up with it. I think many people's bodies are just 'surprised' to suddenly find a fat rich diet, and without enough bile it can run through you. Although, I don't think anything really stops the microbiome changes. Still, it might help reduce things a bit. Good luck, and hang in there! It gets much better.",
m5folgf,t1_m58r7bk,1hsugtk,If it's the stomach not digesting the food properly I can recommend digestive enzymes. Did the job for me. Hopefully won't need them after a while but they can help transition into the diet if you didn't eat much protein and fats before.,

m5j600n,t1_m5folgf,1hsugtk,Thanks for this tip! I’ll check it out!,
m62mpnp,t1_m5a3j08,1hsugtk,"I know transitioning is very tough for some people, but the health issues really improve. For folks like myself, keeping strict is easier because my body begins to be in pain the second I ""cheat"", aka poison myself for brief taste pleasures. Just be wary of adding too much fat too fast. 

Try and find folks who had the same problems you have and see what they did or what was wrong. It really helps, especially because some folks have a reaction to histamine, or dairy, or chemical additives to bacon, or chicken, or whatever that you may be experiencing without knowing. In such a situation you will be doing carnivore correctly, but still not feeling great. Sometimes it is one's beloved coffee one can't imagine giving up, or an additive to an electrolyte mix, that is the trouble. Keep at it and I wish you all the best!",

The wheat itself is not the issue, it’s the milling and processing where the additives are introduced to increase shelf life and appearance. There are many countries allowing GMO wheat, Argentina being one that exports their wheat, and is a recent development actually. The US will not be growing GMO wheat unless the export markets allow it, because once you start you will never get it out of the supply. There is some faint traces of GMO wheat from an experimental product in the early 2000s, but it is as of now a regional issue, not something you’d find in your everyday flour.",

This can give a distorted view that it's the same community commenting, when the community is more likely split in half. Group 1 do carnivore and want the sub to be ""pure"" (no fruit, veg, definitely no carby pizzas), Group 2 basically do keto or animal based and take the fashionable line of, ""Just enjoy your life, cheat sometimes that's fine, enjoy food with friends and family, just hop back on the next day!

Monsanto does own Bayer, who does sell wheat varieties but they have the same process and are a fraction of the US wheat market. I’m a wheat farmer, and attend meetings on these specific topics.

m81kvdp,t1_m80in30,1i4mjkk,"The majority of people on this sub aren't carnivore, certainly not strict carnivore, not animal-based, not ketovore, not even keto. Eating a lot of meat five days per week while also having fruit and protein powder, then binge-drinking on weekends and inhaling two pizzas, Chinese food, and ice cream isn't *any* diet—it's just eating whatever and LARPing as a caveman online.

The real kicker? Some of these same people have the audacity to go on r/keto and other subs to talk down to people who are *actually* following a structured diet. I don't care what anyone eats, but the hypocrisy is off the charts and absolutely worth calling out.",
m7zr55g,t1_m7yk75p,1i4mjkk,Welcome to the internet.  You must be new here.,
m7xjo2v,t1_m7xfy5n,1i4mjkk,"They love gatekeeping what’s “strict carnivore” when it’s convenient—talking down to anyone who eats a blueberry to feel superior—but then turn around and down a six-pack, go on a weekend bender, and inhale two pizzas. But it’s fine because it was a ‘cheat day.’ Just admit you're not a strict carnivore. Making up silly terms like 'flexible carnivore' to justify it is laughable.

Also, hilarious how OP was just on r/keto less than 10 hours ago lecturing someone about how 100 grams of carbs ‘isn’t keto’ while pretending to be the purity police there. Meanwhile, here they are, bingeing Domino’s. The hypocrisy is unreal.",

m80ntwg,t1_m80mhup,1i4mjkk,"So if I assume all that you said is accurate, is there any benefit to consuming organic wheat over conventional?",
m80vb0j,t1_m80mhup,1i4mjkk,That’s good to know. Any advice on how to avoid “enriched” wheat? As far as I know the biggest issue is the folic acid.,
m7y5z62,t1_m7xjo2v,1i4mjkk,"Yeah. All those 'animal based' love gatekeeping people away from eating ""eat meat, mostly fatty meat"".""",
m7wkcgn,t1_m7wk0kb,1i4mjkk,If you would have tossed an avocado on there no one would have bat an eye 😂,😂
m80qm59,t1_m80ntwg,1i4mjkk,"There is a lot of the exact same wheat varieties that go into regular flour going into your Organic flour. The production (fertilizer, chemical, fungicides) from seed to flour is different, but the actual kernel going in and kernel going out has the same genetic makeup. Europe does have an heirloom wheat market, think if you pushed pause on the wheat breeding eons ago. I’d have to do some looking into exactly how the market works for that, but I can tell you we could put that same heirloom variety into our production process and it would grow, but probably end up yielding far less per acre of usable wheat due to lack of disease and drought tolerance. I grow yellow peas as well, they are food grade with the same varieties going to conventional and organic producers",
m80y6ml,t1_m80vb0j,1i4mjkk,"That’s an excellent question. I assume you mean the enriched flour, not wheat? I don’t buy a ton of flour, my wife does do a lot of sourdough and has definitely roamed around. Beings as it is a USDA requirement, I don’t know how you steer around that complexity without milling your own wheat, there is nothing illegal about buying wheat from a farmer if you can find one that will sell it to you, if the folic acid is your concern.",

m80xj1r,t1_m80qm59,1i4mjkk,"Thanks for your input. Last question., what’s your opinion on einkron? Any benefits there? I’m not talking about nutritional differences mainly asking about “cleanliness”/purity",
m80ypnv,t1_m80y6ml,1i4mjkk,"I did mean flour, my bad. My mom loves doing sourdough and I’ve been trying to figure out how to get her away from enriched flour. Problem is we don’t farm wheat anywhere around me. Deep South. I can and do buy plenty of beef and eggs direct from farmers.",
m8119q2,t1_m80xj1r,1i4mjkk,"Thanks for being receptive of my input! Einkron is an ancient grain, older than the heirloom stuff mentioned before. If you are asking about cleanliness and purity, I think it is such a small production/ niche market that it has good potential to be very good on the QC side. The flip side to that is going to be cost and stability of the market. Farm land isn’t free, nor is time and other inputs. I don’t know how much of that grain you get per acre when it is grown, but I expect it to be relatively low compared to modern wheats. Take the same land and the same time and effort, but only able to produce 1/3 or 1/2 the output, the costs are still there so the grain needs to be worth 2-3x more than the comparable alternatives to economically function. Couple that with trying to do it “organically” you could end up with a product that costs 6x more than the other alternatives",
m817gnc,t1_m80ypnv,1i4mjkk,"Interesting! Yes that would be an issue, I really don’t know what to tell you to truly get around it, if there is any particular brand you can do research on that is doing the bare minimum, I guess steer that route? My wife did poorly on folic acid while pregnant, any prenatal supplements just made her feel twice as bad.",
m814owg,t1_m8119q2,1i4mjkk,"I love to learn on this topic so thank you for the education. And, it is absolutely about 6x more expensive. Interestingly, I have an autoimmune disease. I seem to react far less to einkorn than any other wheat (not positive yet). In my mind, you get what you pay for and I’ll pay that farmer all day every day to be able to splurge now and then. To your point, Non organic wheat is fortified with synthetic vitamins etc and I certainly react to that. But thanks again.",
m81c89i,t1_m817gnc,1i4mjkk,"I believe it. Folic acid was one of the main things that led me to this diet. It’s not a real food, it’s a lab synthesized chemical supposed to methylate into folate. Problem is about 40% of people don’t have the gene to methylate it into a useable nutrient, yet they spray it all over our cereal grains and call it “enriched”. The result is people who are low in folate and full of folic acid, which is effectively poison to half the population.",
m815x2z,t1_m814owg,1i4mjkk,"Absolutely understand your situation, I know many people that have adverse reactions and most definitely need to be eating what their body accepts. It’s out of the question for you to not pay for the expensive alternatives, I feel for you on that one! Have you tried millet flours at all?",
m81gwpm,t1_m81c89i,1i4mjkk,"I have high hopes things like this in our foods will improve going forward, but I don’t want the people making the rules having never been on a farm. I don’t think farmers are unwilling to make changes if we can help, but I think the processors who are few in number need to be addressed first and foremost. Some of the perception out there is that the growers are blasting the foods with chemicals and bad practices that endanger the consumer, and it’s just not the case. There is more to dig up, like the folic acid in flour, that is a direct in the mouth consumer issue that needs to be addressed.",
m81gf2o,t1_m815x2z,1i4mjkk,No I haven’t! This is my intro. to that honestly. I’ll have to look into it.,
m82wxzt,t1_m81gwpm,1i4mjkk,It’s easier to blame the farmers. Than the processors I’d bet,
m81hteh,t1_m81gf2o,1i4mjkk,"It would also be non-gmo and gluten free, completely different plant family than wheat. Also an ancient grain. Good luck!",
m833d4k,t1_m82wxzt,1i4mjkk,"The farmers are the ones you see out in the fields driving tractors, spreading fertilizer, and spraying their fields. Constantly in the public eye, just over the fence from suburbia. Nobody can see into a General Mills plant, not without permission and a guided tour! I bet if more people talked to a farmer and then a processor, you’d see in a hurry who fills you full of more 🐂💩that is just said to make you feel better!",🐂💩

I don’t eat my first meal until between 11 & 12 and it usually consists of about 10 ounces of salmon / salmon skin (a lot of my meals are just crispy salmon skin) paired with either canned oysters, some sort of white fish, or my favorite meat crisps/chips, Carnivore Crisps & Snax and/or 12 Hr Meats.
I don’t eat anything until dinner.
I only drink Zevia (which wouldn’t necessarily be considered full blown carnivore). I drink about 6-8 of these a day (an expensive habit but it works for me).
Dinner is pretty similar to lunch but just MORE of it (I do Japanese food take out a lot where I get salmon skin, salmon sashimi and hamachi Kama). 
I’d say I eat about 2000-2500 calories a day. And it’s a balance of fat and protein. 
I tend to get anywhere from 25-40k steps a day.
I go to bed between 9:15 and 10 pm (sometimes earlier, sometimes later).",
ly2qz5j,t1_ly0yxtn,1gtahsq,"I almost exclusively eat salmon skin. I buy the skin and fry it up every single day. I love the crunchy / crispy texture/consistency so I air fry, pan fry or roast. No broth or soup. I eat collars and bellies, etc by air frying them.",

lxu7tfd,t1_lxqem8k,1gtahsq,"Do you wake up at 2:30 am on your own or from an alarm? Do you find you need less sleep now that you cut out all vegetables, etc?",
ly44d0n,t1_ly2r0sg,1gtahsq,"Damn! That looks soooo good right now. Thanks for the photo and reply. Last question--do you ever need to eat extra fat with your fish or is there enough in a pan like that to fuel you?


By the way, you look amazing. Congratulations on thriving on carnivore!",
lxqm7wc,t1_lxqeze4,1gtahsq,Feel free to message me any time!,
lxwj8u7,t1_lxu7tfd,1gtahsq,"I tend to. But I also have a quiet alarm that goes off as well. And no, my sleep allotment is the same. I’ve been waking up this early for a very long time!",
ly85qz3,t1_ly44d0n,1gtahsq,I never add any extra fat! The cuts of salmon / fish I eat are very fatty all by themselves.,
lxqpknz,t1_lxqm7wc,1gtahsq,Omg thank you ❤️,❤
lrpxxw9,t3_1g2kw6n,1g2kw6n,"Yup, I am male and have somewhat low bodyfat to see some abs occasionally. And yet when I was eating clean+balanced diet, if I completely relax my transverse abdominal muscles, my belly protrudes out as if it's pregnant. This was especially apparent at night time after having eaten every meal of the day.

And I can guarantee you that many ""fit"" people are like that too. As I had ""fit"" friends (who are in their early 20s) that can do the same. 

After going carnivore, even if I purposefully inhale air and protrude out my belly, the size is still much smaller and appears much more normal.

I don't know if it was bloating, fiber being slow to digest or even visceral fat, but I definitely prefer my belly while Im eliminating anything that's not meat/eggs.",
lrpypb7,t3_1g2kw6n,1g2kw6n,Nice! Spinach is very high in oxalates which I learned from Sally Norton's book Toxic Superfoods. High oxalate foods make my digestive system just miserable. Glad you are feeling well on carnivore.,

lrq4ck3,t3_1g2kw6n,1g2kw6n,"This makes me so happy for you.  As someone who has struggled with AI and digestive issues, I know this must be such a relief for you.  I know you've been diligent before this, to go ketovore at 14.  
I had also been ketovore and surprisingly just dropping lettuce reduced bloating tremendously.  Congratulations!",

lrqzhzb,t3_1g2kw6n,1g2kw6n,"nice !!! i wish carnivore was cheaper. i felt amazing on carnivore, but the inflation in my country is so bad, and i dont earn more. i tried it with the cheap minced meat, but it doesnt make me feel good like beef or better quality meat does, and i dont do well with eggs. 

i also found with a proper carnivore diet i got zero bloating",
lrtrhjl,t3_1g2kw6n,1g2kw6n,"Nice going!

This is why I don't really like the term Ketovore (besides the fact that it literally means ""one who eats ketones"" 🤣). It's just keto that includes a lot of meat, which for many people is nothing like Carnivore from an experiential point of view, and I think the term makes it sound like you would get mostly the same results, when really, true Carnivore is a game changer for a lot of people.

Do or do not. There is no ketovore.  😜",🤣😜

lrqhu3z,t1_lrpxxw9,1g2kw6n,"Heck yes!! Honestly, after this little experiment, I believe fiber TRULY TRULY is the devil (have always sort of thought that lol) and definitely SLOWS digestion.",
lrqikwt,t1_lrpypb7,1g2kw6n,Absolutely. That book is a really interesting read. Highly recommended. (Actually came here to say this but you beat me to it. :-) ),
lrqhzv2,t1_lrq4ck3,1g2kw6n,Yessss! I dropped lettuce (specifically romaine) long ago and that also made a huge difference for me (pain wise)! So glad you’re feeling good too!!,
lrrtoun,t1_lrqzhzb,1g2kw6n,I honestly never understood people complaining about the cost of carnivore diet I personally spend less than I would eating a conventional diet not buying a bunch of different ingredients for recipes and fruits vegetables etc are actually pretty expensive and then of course your occasional junk food and desserts lol,
lrujer4,t1_lrtrhjl,1g2kw6n,"Ha Ha! I don’t really like labels in general- I do the GiGi Approach (my name) as I have had a very limited lifestyle since I was 14 and it just gets even more limited as I get older - but I’m not complaining!

lrqrd1n,t1_lrqhzv2,1g2kw6n,"I am still surprised by how much positive effect I felt from just dropping lettuce.  I was eating low fodmap, low histamine, low oxalate, and thought lettuce would be fine.  
I am still dealing with fatigue and weight gain at 9 weeks in, but my primary reason was for my gut, and AI symptoms.  My gut is soooo much better on carnivore. So I keep focusing on that.  Are you feeling better in other ways as well?",
lrrtz78,t1_lrrtoun,1g2kw6n,"Well i dont eat alot or eat junk or sweets to begin with. For me it sadly is more expensive - but its possible we don’t live in the same country and don’t have the same price dimensions. Also im really poor, my rent just got alot higher due to inflation. Edit : inflation sadly did not reach my income yet but everything else",

You're welcome!",
lrujvp3,t1_lrqrd1n,1g2kw6n,"This is great!! I hope you can curb the fatigue soon. Perhaps it’s just your body adjusting to this new lifestyle. 

Hmmmm better in other ways- I mean, with less bloating I definitely have more body confidence. I’ve worked out HARD my whole life but my intestinal issues always got in the way of me looking PEAK but now I’m feeling more PEAK than ever and I absolutely want to rock my birthday suit more often LOL.

Otherwise not really? I still have HORRIFIC BACK PAIN (but I believe this is due to a variety of factors) but maybe after my body totally dumps the oxalates, I’ll feel a little better from that. I will say though - PMS/PERIOD wise… Farrrrrr less bloating/puffiness prior to the time of the month!",
lrujid2,t1_lrrtz78,1g2kw6n,What country to do you live in? I’m sorry to hear about your struggles. What about canned fish? Canned chicken?,
lrruvfw,t1_lrrtz78,1g2kw6n,Yea you’re right ! Sorry to hear about that I hope everything smoothes out for you,
lrvr6j1,t1_lrujvp3,1g2kw6n,"This is so good!   You are doing awesome.  I'm also having some back pain and remember having this when stopping oxalate a couple years ago.  So I think it is oxalate dumping also.  It did get better for me over about 6 months, last time from what I remember.  I hope you continue to feel better and better!  Do you plan to stay carnivore for life?",
lrvchpi,t1_lrujid2,1g2kw6n,"Oh i don’t think i ever seen canned chicken in my country, i do eat cheap canned fish ! But the issue is the one with veggies and tomato sauce is the cheapest next to the one in oil ! 

And one of it is for example the same price for 175 g as for 700 g bread, so when i know im going to be out of money i have to choose the 700 g as they would cover me more days. But i do still try any month i got more money to eat better - i do awful with cheap bread",
lrruyvy,t1_lrruvfw,1g2kw6n,Thanks ! Im hoping too :) i actually have to fast till the 17th,
ls08vzc,t1_lrvr6j1,1g2kw6n,"I’m definitely going to keep tabs! :)

And absolutely. I have been “ketovore” since 14 so I really know no other lifestyle aside from one HEAVY (only) on animals!",
lrrv7xz,t1_lrruyvy,1g2kw6n,That’s so funny actually was talking to a friend about benefits of fasting and we laughed and said it definitely saves you a heck ton of money 😂 that’s also might be why I don’t notice the expense of carnivore I usually fast 2-3 days a week and usually do omad,😂
lrrvqfk,t1_lrrv7xz,1g2kw6n,"I just wish i could afford the electrolytes ! I actually have the challenge that i have to keep my weight up and not get too skinny and too weak - its a bit of a challenge, so financially i sometimes try and get whatever got the most calorie per amount of food that is the cheapest. Its kinda difficult to get enough food to have enough energy and not loose too much weight !",

I just underwent a big surgery to repair my neck (which had also affected my ability to use my left arm) and so having the use of my arm back and a HUGE reduction in pain for me has helped me have hope once again.  Being in pain and just watching my weight go up and up and up was so demoralizing to the point where I couldn’t even recognize myself in the mirror.  I just started carnivore and have lost 8 pounds already!  The first time since my injury I’ve ever made the scale budge in that direction!  Again, hope has been restored!  And THANK YOU, because now I see your post, see your commitment and the gains (or losses for that matter!) you’ve made and I have to say it keeps my hope train chugging along.

m227wtk,t3_1he2503,1he2503,"Congratulations on your progress, brother. 80 lbs and 9 inches lost is a huge accomplishment! Keep it up! :) And re: body hatred.... as someone else pointed out: Carnivore can actually help us learn to love and appreciate our bodies even for their ability to put on fat, as we observe our body's genius to optimize based on originally-intended inputs. Because evolutionarily, putting on fat is actually a smart thing for our body to be able to do -- so that if we have to go a long time before finding our next meal, our body can live off of the stored fat. Think of bears and how they over-eat prior to hibernation. I think it makes sense that prior to lean winter months, humans would also have fattened up a bit on berries and so on, to have that extra energy boost from the fat they now have to burn off during the winter.

The modern day has exposed our bodies to completely unprecedented levels of access to fattening substances (in concentrations that don't exist in nature, and with extra addiction-inducing techniques added), so the amount of fat many have put on is also unprecedented, with evolution-unanticipated side effects -- but the underlying mechanism that our bodies are using is smart in its place, and helpful when we replace the deranging inputs with evolution-consistent inputs. Your body loves you and is trying to help you, and now that you have the knowledge to feed it what it needs, you're loving your body well too.",

Literally just wrote a prescription for escitolopram and klonopin. I had a terrible reaction to the latter and told the doctor on a follow up appointment that it gave me the worst panic attack of my life and that I will no longer be taking it as a way to stop panic attacks. He then casually said ""probably good, that stuff is pretty addictive"". First mention of that as well. Coming off of the SSRIs years later was hellacious, mood swings, deep bouts of depression and anxiety, and brain zaps galore.

Modern medicine is a lot of ""here's a chemical/drug we don't know a lot about"" and seeing how it effects people. Like, I saw an article about how scientists still don't know HOW Tylenol works. TYLENOL. OVER THE COUNTER MEDICINE WE'RE TOLD TO USE FOR HEADACHES,ETC.


Bonkers.


Medicinal practice is ""check symptoms"" ""prescribe drugs"" ... Or if you're a woman ""ignore symptoms"" ""lose weight/reduce stress."" 


If you look at the history of medicine, it is better now.... Healers used plants for meds (which can work to a degree, some plants are anti-microbial and stop bleeding). But plants don't always work and religion really influences people so they'd do weird shit like bleeding people or balancing humors or other extremely barbaric things. Not that long ago they used mercury for syphilis. 


So compared to 100-200 yrs ago, medicine has come a long way and is less barbaric BUT it has a long way to go.


During the 1970s (iirc) they started using beneficial bacteria on newborn babies to reduce the risk of staph infections. It worked. But then super antibiotics came around and they stopped. Now we're seeing a rise again of antibiotic resistant MRSA (staph). For some reason western culture loves pills and meds. Idk why. Why didn't we just stick to the probiotic on babies' skin?! It worked!!! 


It's a cultural problem but i think, bc of social media, scientists are (hopefully) starting to see a difference. When I was first diagnosed with rheumatoid arthritis, the doctor told me diet doesn't impact anything. Now, years later, they recommend a keto diet to reduce inflammation. 


Anyway, it sucks the answer was simple, but I don't think doctors are being malicious. Pharmaceutical companies are corpo monsters that should be reigned in, I do agree with that. Fuck corporatization of medicine. ",

""Oh. You've been crying for two hours every day and you don't know why? Here's a pill."" 🙄 😒 After a month or two of that not really working, the dosage was increased and I was also prescribed clonidine and guanfacine on an ""as needed"" basis. I believe these two drugs are also used to treat high blood pressure which I never had, so when I took them for anxiety, I basically couldn't do anything because my blood pressure was lowered.

Eventually I quit all of it cold turkey, and in my case, the medicine did nothing positive. Generally you shouldn't quit sertraline cold turkey; I just forgot to take it for a few weeks, and when I realized that nothing really changed because of the medicine, I just decided to stop.

Of course, I myself worked in Pharma and thought I was a good thing back in the day. I'm talking about that infamous 1%, humans are not evil by nature. 

> People like to blame ""the system,"" but that system is made up of individuals who make choices. At the same time, not all individuals in the system are conscious of the net effects of that system. One might say that the system itself is designed to obfuscate its own effects and one's complicity in those effects.

It's the system that's rigged and indeed a lot of people are not aware what they're 'serving'. Though, the world is awakening and getting conscious. Everybody on his or her own time and level, but we're getting there. 2025... the world is healing and getting better.",

l5vb5gz,t3_1d1aeqg,1d1aeqg,"I am so happy that you have found this way of eating effective.

In nutrition school, I learned how schizophrenic patients have a significantly higher need for b vitamins (among other nutrients).  We looked at research done at an inpatient facility back in the 1960s where they were able to control the diet of the patients they were studying.  The research was very compelling but ultimately abandoned due to medication becoming the standard of care instead of lifestyle for mental health issues.

I know how much the diet impacts mental, emotional and physical well being.  I am pained and saddened to see how many people struggling with mental health have no idea that a diet change can positively impact their whole existence. I think it is CRIMINAL that mental health ""professionals"" don't have diet change as their primary treatment.

Keep going and might I suggest you look into which specific nutrients are most beneficial for you!  Organ meats might be a great addition, if you're not already eating them.

Living mostly on my own made the difference for me, and someone who was there for me and understood what was going on. Without the right circumstances, I don't know if I ever would have made the change.

When I was really unwell, I was too disorganized and scattered to really do anything. Especially something so disciplinary as carnivore. And when I did decide to do it, I just happened to be clear enough mentally to believe in what I was doing.

Also, carnivore, if done correctly (adequate protein & high fat), is a therapeutic ketogenic diet and has been used since the early 1900’s to treat psychiatric disorders but our medical industry felt they knew better.
