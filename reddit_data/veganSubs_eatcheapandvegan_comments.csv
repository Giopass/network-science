kobeyva,t3_1afoybe,1afoybe,"#**Welcome to r/EatCheapAndVegan.**
**Veganism is not a diet**. However, there is a ton of misinformation and misunderstanding about the cost of **eating vegan** and this subreddit exists to hopefully dispell those false claims. Be advised submissions containing expensive processed food items will be removed.



**Definition of veganism:** *Veganism is a philosophy and way of living which seeks to exclude‚Äîas far as is possible and practicable‚Äîall forms of exploitation of, and cruelty to, animals for food, clothing or any other purpose; and by extension, promotes the development and use of animal-free alternatives for the benefit of animals, humans and the environment. In dietary terms it denotes the practice of dispensing with all products derived wholly or partly from animals.*

kof9ku4,t3_1afoybe,1afoybe,"Yummmm!! The cauliflower wings though üòç üò© 
The Curry & mashed potato recipes look really good... 
I especially love the use of cilantro. 
I really hate being plant based & despising mushrooms.. I have tried all different kinds & cooked them all different ways & just CANNOT. It's unfortunate because many vegan/vegetarian meals are often centered around mushrooms. Potatoes will forever have my heart though. 
I've been following a blogger/site called Cookie & Kate the last 7 years (all her recipes are wfpb but have both vegeterian & vegan mods) & there's a recipe called Crack Broccoli Tacos that has been mine & my kiddos favorite for years- we just use a homemade tortillas & BBQ sauce. I don't get on IG anymore but I definitely miss pictures like this bc they inspire me. 
Congrats to your wife & kudos to you for giving her props! üëèüèº",üòçüò©üëèüèº

Ingredients:  
1 small cauliflower  
For the batter:  
1 cup flour (I used Schar Mix C for its finer texture; if not gluten-free, wheat flour works)  
1 cup water  
Salt  
Spices (black pepper, chili flakes, etc.)  
1.5 cups breadcrumbs (I used Schar)  
Sauce:  
2/3 cup tamari, coconut aminos, or regular soy sauce (if not gluten-free)  
1 tsp sesame oil  
1/4 cup rice vinegar  
1/4 cup agave syrup  
Chili flakes, garlic powder, onion powder, smoked paprika  
(Sometimes I add 1 tsp tomato paste but not always)  
1/4 cup water  
1 large tbsp cornstarch  
Black and white sesame seeds  
Instructions:  
Preheat the oven to 390¬∞F.  
Cut the cauliflower into small pieces.  
In a bowl, mix flour and water until it reaches a batter consistency (add water slowly to achieve the desired consistency).  
Coat cauliflower pieces in the batter and then dip them in breadcrumbs to coat.  
Place the coated cauliflower on a lined baking tray and bake for 25-30 minutes, preferably flipping them halfway through.  
Prepare the sauce by mixing all the sauce ingredients. In another bowl, mix water and cornstarch.  
Heat the sauce in a frying pan, then add the cornstarch mixture and whisk until the mixture thickens.  
Pour the baked cauliflower into the sauce, and add sesame seeds (generous serving)",

**Veganism is not a diet**. However, there is a ton of misinformation and misunderstanding about the cost of **eating vegan** and this subreddit exists to hopefully dispell those false claims. Be advised submissions containing expensive processed food items will be removed.



**Definition of veganism:** *Veganism is a philosophy and way of living which seeks to exclude‚Äîas far as is possible and practicable‚Äîall forms of exploitation of, and cruelty to, animals for food, clothing or any other purpose; and by extension, promotes the development and use of animal-free alternatives for the benefit of animals, humans and the environment. In dietary terms it denotes the practice of dispensing with all products derived wholly or partly from animals.*

Just wanted to mention, if you are eating beans and rice every day, you could make it *significantly* cheaper by cooking your own rice and beans from scratch. It's very easy, especially if you have access to a rice cooker. The rice is also much better texture, in my opinion.


You can get a 4 pound bag of black beans for $5 at Walmart, and a 5 pound bag of brown rice for $4. So, for the cost of 3 of your current meals, you could make like... 15 meals. With lots of rice left over. Five times cheaper!",

Made me curious‚Ä¶so I asked. 

‚ÄúRice and beans are a staple food in many parts of the world, including Asia, Latin America, and parts of Africa. Rice is a food staple for more than 3.5 billion people, and rice and beans are a culinary backbone in many households. 

Rice and beans are a complete protein because each contributes what the other is missing. They are highly valued in areas where animal proteins are hard to obtain and expensive. Rice and beans also provide ample B vitamins and minerals, such as magnesium and potassium. 

Here are some other facts about rice and beans:

Rice
Rice is adaptable, accessible, and affordable, so many people eat it regularly. The American Heart Association recommends that adults consume six servings of grains per day, which can include rice. 

Beans
The U.S. Dietary Guidelines recommends eating about 1-3 cups of legumes per week. However, most Americans consume less than 1/3 cup weekly.‚Äù",

m4aeutr,t1_m4ad6ij,1hoikcg,"Agreed about G&G. Discovered a fantastic food hack at Target. A local university here in SoCal has a mini Target on campus. The prices on most things are the same as a regular store, but some things are cheaper. I routinely buy avocados for‚Ä¶wait for it‚Ä¶.$.95! This is half of what Trader Joe‚Äôs charges, 33% less than the major supermarket chain price and it keeps me swimming in avocado.",
m4dil5e,t1_m4dfujv,1hoikcg,"Exactly. I don‚Äôt really do white rice, but Target also offers other options like a [brown rice, lentil and quinoa blend](https://www.target.com/p/90-second-whole-grain-blend-with-brown-rice-lentils-38-quinoa-8-8oz-good-38-gather-8482/-/A-54600370#lnk=sametab) that‚Äôs amazing. 

They also offer a bunch of [bean varieties/blends](https://www.target.com/p/90-second-whole-grain-blend-with-brown-rice-lentils-38-quinoa-8-8oz-good-38-gather-8482/-/A-54600370#lnk=sametab) that I rotate through. 

I love spicy foods, so sometimes it‚Äôs seasoned  tobasco, sometimes it‚Äôs a curry blend and many times it‚Äôs sriracha. Lots of possibilities. 

Nutritional yeast shines brightest when paired with healthy fat like nuts or avocado. It really brings out the cheesy goodness (many vegan cheeses are crafted around nooch. Once had a restaurant owner put a handful of cashews in his mouth followed by a handful of nutritional yeast to prove this point. He stopped buying vegan cheese and started making his own which is now much cheaper, fresher and has no preservatives.

One of my go to meals is a baked sweet potato with avocado or tahini, a little spice and a lot of nutritional yeast.",
m4l1ete,t1_m4dfujv,1hoikcg,"Nutritional yeast can be really good for sauces, too, because it is a thickener and adds flavor and protein.  
I make a quick sauce sometimes for gnocchi or vegetables where I put a cup of nondairy milk in the pan with crushed garlic and seasonings and then 2 T of nooch.  Then I cook it down to the consistency I want.  
So easy and adds some great heartiness to a meal.",

m4asq1a,t1_m4aneqy,1hoikcg,"There is a never ending trial and error aspect to vanlife. Had a fridge/freezer for a bit but it needed more electricity than I could consistently provide. I ended up giving it to a guy with an RV with 400W of solar panels  He was psyched!

I have a 30 qt cooler that I have never, ever put ice in over 9 years of sleeping over tires. It‚Äôs home to vinegars, spices, avocados, nuts, bread, and, of course, nutritional yeast. 

I discovered that if I had a gallon jug of water in there it would get almost as cold as the night time temperature and stay pretty cool for the day. It does what I need it to do. It will not safely store cooked rice (one of the most common sources of food borne illness) or other perishables. 

Had an Instantpot for a while also. Great cooking device! Still, not so easy to set up and use in public and cooking smells and car upholstery are not a great fit. 

The big picture is that those of us who live this way are constantly learning and trying new things. I learned how to make it work for me.

Cans are normally sprayed with an epoxy as it sets quickly. Many replaced BPA with BPS, and the jury is still out on whether that's an improvement.

m4d0owm,t1_m4br16c,1hoikcg,"The reason whole food is important is that it contains all the nutrients nature intended it to have. Here in the US, many processed foods lose those, the most important being fiber.

From Google:

‚ÄúAccording to the 2020-2025 Dietary Guidelines for Americans, more than 90% of women and 97% of men in the United States don‚Äôt consume enough fiber: 

Recommended amount

The guidelines recommend that people consume 28‚Äì34 grams of fiber per day, depending on their age and sex. 

Health benefits
Fiber-rich diets can: 
- Improve gut health 
- Increase longevity 
- Reduce the risk of chronic conditions like heart disease, diabetes, and some types of cancer 

Causes of low fiber intake

I have issues with spiders but since worms etc are so much more evil and deadly it has been demanded that they be removed and placed in the yard waste container as burning (unless recreational,) has been outlawed by our homeowners association is apparently a fate worse than death.

lsfgotu,t3_1g61666,1g61666,"This recipe is super easy, but it may take a few tries to perfect it to your personal tastes and how firm you like your seitan. More kneading will give you a tougher, denser seitan which is great if you want to slice it or make mock tendies, and minimal kneading will give you a fluffier seitan. When you add the water, it should be kind of tacky like putty (familiar if you've ever kneaded bread) but feel free to add more or less liquid, or add more VWG if it's too wet.",

lu4u7am,t3_1g61666,1g61666,"Made this seitan, its THE best seitan recipe I've found!! I roasted mine in veggie broth, and they turned out incredibly flavorful. If you don't wanna waste the broth (which you shouldnt, and especially not after trying this gravy recipe!) you should make this simple gravy with the broth.

1.  1 Pour leftover broth into a large saucepan. If there is still broth left over, save to store Seitan in. (This will aid in rehydrating the Seitan when reheating).
2. Bring broth to a simmer. While you wait, in a separate bowl create a 1:1 mixture of cornstarch and cold water. The standard ratio is 1 tbs of cornstarch per 2 cups of broth - estimate as needed for your broth amount.  
3. Mix in the cornstarch slurry slowly, adding as you stir. Stir continuously for 1 minute. Then continue to stir until broth reaches desired consistency. Season and serve hot. 

Seasonings I like to add is pepper and thyme, but you can add whatever you like. This gravy is excellent on mashed potatoes or even directly on the roasts themselves!!

  
As for how I seasoned my seitan, I used 4 tbs of nutritional yeast, 1 tablespoon of garlic powder, 1 tbs of onion powder, and 1 tbs of thyme. It came out like a delicious roast!",
lsih4vv,t3_1g61666,1g61666,"Great recipe. Simple is the best. You can always build on it, and marinades mean you can freeze a big batch of basic but use it in many different ways.

My base is very similar except I favour more accessible ingredients: peanut butter instead of tahini for the fat balance and soy sauce instead of salt+yeast for the umami. Plus vinegar as others have mentioned.

I like to start with the simplest base when I'm trying a new cooking technique or a new structural form, because it makes for a better comparison - not changing to many variants at once.

The first variation I would suggest anyone make from your (or my) basic is adding a small amount of chickpeas or soybeans (thoroughly blitzed in). Varying that can give you every texture from a tight shreddable ""chickn"" to a nicely crumbling burger patty or any imaginable sausage texture.",

I'm trying to get a simple plan together for making seitan, and this post is a great start. I'm trying to keep most everything to ""mix the wet and dry, and knead"". Basically reducing taking out tools and keeping everything as quick and simple as possible, and cheap as well.

The proportions seem to be similar, but this one cooks for 15 minutes instead of a full hour, so I don't know how that might change the texture, if at all. If you're open to experimenting, I would say try it for 15 minutes and cut one open to see how the texture looks?

VWG can be finicky, and I find that it's highly dependent on the humidity in your kitchen. I need less water when I'm making it at my boyfriend's house, whereas my house is drier. It should feel like putty. Start with less water, and if it still feels wet then add a bit more VWG. Luckily the practice tastes delicious!",ü§©

And yeah, it is a pain in the @$$ to clean...one thing I found is that if you have the texture right, you can use the dough ball to stick to the remaining bits in the bowl and absorb it. I use my nails or a spoon to scrape off larger bits. Also, always soak it immediately when you're done because if it dries it's literally glue. Pretty sure I still have some stuck to one of my bowls.

lv14rr4,t1_lv0dh45,1g61666,"Hi friend! I have a draft response to your other comment too, work was bonkers this week lol

Great question on Chronometer! This is just a summary of ingredients based on weights, not for cooked vs non-cooked. I don't think Chronometer has a function for ""cooked"" recipes but maybe on the paid version? There is some evidence that B12 is destroyed by heat and light: https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9822362/?origin=serp_auto  so I think it's reasonable to assume some loss with cooking but it's impossible to quantify.

This recipe will yield 12 small ""breast"" size pieces, if that helps? Not sure when was the last time you saw chix breast for comparison. The baking dish pictured in the OP is 9x13 so it's enough to fill a dish that size. I actually have not done a final cooked weight, but I'll make a batch tomorrow and report back the cooked weight.

I hear you on the costs! VWG is not the cheapest, so I get it. I'm in the US so I watch the King Arthur website and buy when it goes on sale. Another option if you're in the US is Job Lots, if you've heard of it? It's a discount store, but they're a main distributor of Bob's Red Mill products so you can get that brand VWG without paying shipping costs.",

m42ptl4,t1_m3b5jxh,1g61666,"Awesome!! Thanks for the feedback, glad it went well for you. I'm very inexact about measurements, and this recipe is very forgiving, so I like to play around with it. Sometimes a little more or less liquid, etc. Variety is the spice of life and all lol",
m5pe872,t1_m5jgd6l,1g61666,"Hey awesome!! üòÅ Glad it was easy for you. The texture looks good but these do look a bit undercooked...my guess is the larger pieces need longer baking time, probably 1.5 hours? How long did these bake for? Also it helps a lot if they have room in the baking dish, it should be large enough so all pieces can float freely. If they're on top of each other they won't cook through. And yes they will be fairly wet after cooking, and I think the moisture helps with the meaty texture, we definitely don't want them to dry out lol

For further cooking, I would probably cut or tear these into smaller chunks, like if you've ever torn tofu into chunks? I would tear it into chunks and pan-fry with your preferred sauce--teriyaki, or buffalo, or just oil and salt and pepper. Smaller chunks will give them a larger cooking area to soak up flavor. Hope it tastes good! It will also get easier after the first batch.",üòÅ

luzfgnt,t1_luyia5t,1g61666,"Adding flour will reduce the firmness similar to what beans do, but you're basically turning the seitan more and more back into bread. Using beans increases the amount of protein, but also means you're adding different types of protein. You can mash them by hand or by blender. Or you could even just overcook them until they go very soft (turn to soup), since you're adding water later anyway (let them cook though, you won't be able to mix the vwg if the liquid is hot as it will cook).",

The marinade is just about a tablespoon of minced garlic and ginger mix, a glugglug each of vinegar and white wine, a glug each of sriracha and sesame oil and a hefty glugglug of soy sauce. I couldn't taste the sriracha so would probably use chilli flakes next time, I'm just using up the sriracha as I don't really like it. I just pulled about a third of the quantity of seitan into chunks and used all the marinade, and poured some into the pan and cooked it off when the seitan was browned. There's about half of what I marinated in the pan so I'm figuring on getting six or seven meals out of this total quantity of seitan, and I'm a hungry bugger.",

lv2uffi,t1_lv14rr4,1g61666,"I've read that vwg ends up being about 3x times the dry weight in the end, with everything mixed in, maybe 2.5x but about that.

Ive found vwg to be decently cheap from ""anthony's"" brand, it works out to the same as chicken if I get some bigger purchases of ingredients, reduce the price per lb. 

You can certainly find 50lb bags of vwg for cheap, if you order one or two in order to get fre shipping, from one sight it's about 130 a bag if you get free shipping. However, you'd have to preserve the bulk of it on 5 gallon buckets, and while not hard, it's extra work.",

lv9h47m,t1_lv9fvn3,1g61666,"It is 100% user fault. My VWG was expired. My last batch of TVP and VWG meatballs were a little gummy in the center and I thought I'd made a measurement mistake. But since this was a brand new recipe I was being so careful and I knew pretty early on something was wrong, that's when I checked the bag.

The silver lining is that I was just about to make another huge batch of meatballs. so this recipe actually saved me from wasting a ton of other ingredients.

I'm going to get some fresh vwg and try again next weekend. I wish I'd taken a pic. My partner walked into the kitchen as I took them out of the slow cooker and said with much horror in his voice ""What IS that?"" lol

I asked him if he wanted to try them and he told me ""Well I guess my love for you does have a bound and we just found it."" hahahaha",

Would you say beans or bean flour, etc, are necessary, or just help?

I would ideally just like the use the peanut butter, etc, without beans. Do you think the beans are helpful for necessary, if that makes sense?

Doesn't have to be the best product, and I can always experiment, but would be nice to know in case it saves time and effort.",

lvftfl4,t1_lv2uffi,1g61666,"So according to my food scale, the final recipe is 760 grams on the dot.

So using measurements given on the King Arthur bag, 1 serving size is 9 grams, the recipe calls for 288 grams of VWG, 760/288 = 2.64 so that seems to match up with what you've read.

Yes, the storage would be the only downside to getting VWG cheap. I honestly don't know if I would use 50 lbs in a year lol maybe? I should probably figure it out. Someone else mentioned in the comments here that VWG does go off if used past the expiration date though.",
m5ppa5d,t1_m5peozz,1g61666,"I realize it's probably hard to tell from my pic in the OP, but they are all free floating and not touching each other lol the circulating water is what cooks them.

If it were me, I would just go ahead and pan fry these ones, save yourself some time lol the great thing about seitan is there's no food safety issues! Unlike meat which needs to fully cooked to kill bacteria, seitan only needs to be cooked to the texture that you want. My last batch came out pretty dense like this too (my usual baking dishes were occupied) I just pan-fried and mixed the bits into a salad wrap, which I'm going to post pics here shortly.

I. Kid. You. Not.

Maybe if someone else ends up with this atrocity they will now know that their VWG has expired and the center will not hold

lvgamuq,t1_lvg7sik,1g61666,"Well I was a really bad vwg mom. It expired in 2023, I opened the bag at least 10 months ago, didn't seal it well and it has been really, really humid here. Any one of those things would be bad. 

My understanding is that you can go up to 12 months after best by date if sealed, or 6 to 12 months after opened no matter what the best by date is and the long spread is based on how responsible you've been: air tight, dry, cool even fridge or freezer if open. 

So I did everything wrong, but if you test a little bit and it gets lots of gluten strands and becomes a little ummm bouncy?? you are probably fine. Mine wouldn't firm up at all, 3x the vwg the recipe called for and I could barely make a sticky ball with it.

m6lmeni,t1_m6j80wl,1hyne4e,"Brining and pickling are different processes from what OP is doing. OP is doing a ""salt water soak"" which is just salt in water, it's a common technique used for many vegetables to draw out bitter flavors.

Brine is a highly concentrated salt solution which is made by boiling water and dissolving a lot of salt in it while boiling, and the high concentration of salt acts as a preservative: https://thecookingfacts.com/what-is-brine-and-why-is-it-used/ 

Pickling is also a preservation technique, but using vinegar instead of brine. You're right that brining leaves a lot of salt in the final product, that's the intention, but a salt water soak leaves minimal salt in comparison.

Your comment made me curious though if anyone has ever tried brining tofu, and apparently it is a thing! https://www.tastingtable.com/1190539/for-extra-crispy-and-flavorful-tofu-brine-it-first/",

Soaking, I fill a big bowl with water and add a block or two of cut tofu, then add about a couple teaspoons of lawry's, the water should be salted but not excessively salty.

m6p9ruj,t1_m6lmeni,1hyne4e,"You are right on nearly all of this, but pickling can also be done via salt. Vinegar pickling is for a fast pickle. Slow pickling involves packing the item in salt and leaving it alone for some time. See kim chi.",
m6k1s4b,t1_m6k074v,1hyne4e,"If it's firm/extra firm/super firm, you *gotta* cut it before doing anything else, even just splitting it in half helps. Any shape is fine, but boiling works best with large pieces; small pieces tend to disintegrate or get lost to the colander. 

Just boiling is fine, but adding salt to the water allows a bit of flavor to penetrate, and that in itself helps cover the soy.

Soaking requires salt imo, and then rinsing.

Using cold water after boiling is fine if you want to work with it quickly or if you plan on pressing it.",

I just looked, and Sunrise's extra firm tofu is what i generally term ""super firm"" tofu: in vacuum seal packing only, not a hard plastic tub. This brand, Azumaya, and many others label their extra firm tofu like this, in a rigid plastic tub. That's the equivalent of Sunrise's ""firm"" tofu. All of these have similar nutrition (about 80 calories for 3 oz serving, 8g of protein). The prices are about the same across brand when you do an accurate comparison, with tub firm / extra firm types being substantially less than vacuum, super firm types.

There's no deceptive advertising practice here by House Foods, or by Azumaya, or any other tofu brand.",

* 3/4 package of firm tofu
* Juice and zest of half a lemon
* 2 tbsp nooch
* 1/2 tbsp-ish of cayenne
* Handful of dill from my garden (all herbs optional, can use dried as well)
* 1/2 cup of almond milk since it was a bit dry, water is fine too
* Salt and pepper to taste

Blended it together while the pasta was boiling and dinner in under 15 minutes! Pictured here the pasta is served with sauce, chickpeas and sliced fresh basil.

I do similar sauce blends with parsley or cilantro for extra vitamin K but the dill happens to be prolific right now. Garlic or onion powder are also fantastic additions, or roasted garlic to really step it up. Play around with ingredients, tofu is a great base for literally anything. You can't go wrong.",

You can always add the liquid in small amounts, and don't add the full amount if it's not needed. I frequently add more liquid as I'm mixing. Especially with potatoes, you can always add more but you can't really drain it once there's too much lol",

I was torn on which processing method to use for each, since things like roasted soybeans have much higher protein density than soaked soybeans.

Maybe another graph could be the most common ones on this graph, with different processing methods.",
lj21evl,t1_lj1kk5u,1ewtvc4,"How do you get that? A bulk box is $77.69 for 12 lbs or 5443 grams. A serving of is 30g, so each bulk box has about 181 servings. $77.69 / 181 = $0.43, so about 40¬¢ per serving. Each serving has 10g of protein. That would be twice your claim, so $2 per 50g. Still a deal, but you have to buy the bulk box as the individual 8oz bags are much less cost efficient. I love the bulk box and they say it keeps fresh in a pantry for about 6 months. Freeze it if you won't use it prior.",
lj4hp3p,t1_lj159u4,1ewtvc4,"Per calorie would also have the advantage of controlling for how wet foods are. E.g. the soy and almond milks have much lower protein/mass than soybeans and almonds, even though they actually have more protein/calorie, because beans are dry and vegetable milks are mostly water. 

Likewise, potato gets displaced farther away from the grains than it probably should be, because potatoes are much wetter, whereas the finished products like breads and pasta have been hydrated to a similar range as potatoes",

ljduwod,t1_ljd4r3t,1ewtvc4,I dont think there‚Äôs a page for the detailed numbers for every product there but a starting point would be looking up subsidies of plant vs animal based products. It‚Äôs gonna be hard to be totally accurate since some plant products could be subsidized differently depending on wether they are considered essential maybe? Some countries do that.,
lj3erbq,t1_lj1kthp,1ewtvc4,Eating them is. Why would I care about weight when I bought them? Should I count the packaging too?,
lj25whp,t1_lj21evl,1ewtvc4,"I went by European prices, assuming soy curls would be cheaper in the USA. Here I pay around ‚Ç¨10 for a kilo. Soy curls here are 50g of protein per 100g, are they not in the US?",
ljbr0ut,t1_ljbpkqf,1ewtvc4,"Sorry, almost there. Can I assume anything about digestibility from this graph or just that it accounts for it in the protein sum? Or is it lrotein more prevalent AND digestible the further right on the X?",

lv8crne,t3_1giuoza,1giuoza,As a farmer I would highly recommend not eating pumpkins sold for Halloween. Many of the seeds are treated with antifungals and are not to be consumed. Commercial seed companies have warnings on the labels. Unfortunately there is no way of knowing which have or haven‚Äôt been treated.,
lv9icuy,t3_1giuoza,1giuoza,lots of bad chemicals can get used on plants not intended for eating. grocery store pumpkins should be safe if they are not taxed and not marked as decorative. otherwise please don‚Äôt eat.,
lvciri5,t3_1giuoza,1giuoza,"This post is wild 

1. Decorative plants are usually covered in chemicals you shouldn‚Äôt be eating

2. Decorative gourds/pumpkins are usually fibrous, pale, and don‚Äôt taste good

3. They‚Äôre probably close to rotten and have been at the stores for weeks",

lvf5cpj,t3_1giuoza,1giuoza,"Everyone I know uses Halloween pumpkins to make desserts or roasting the seeds. Surprised at all the comments. 

Pretty sure they‚Äôre safe unless they‚Äôre marked ‚Äúnot for human consumption‚Äù",
lv8khie,t3_1giuoza,1giuoza,[deleted],
lv8768h,t3_1giuoza,1giuoza,"Right after Halloween is the perfect time to snag one or more, they'll keep for months if stored properly (cool dry conditions like potatoes). Most people don't know that these gourds are edible, and can be baked or roasted and used in all sorts of ways, and they make delicious pies. I have one baking in my oven right now that was around 20lbs. With a little prep work, it's like getting 10 cans of pumpkin for $1!",
lv8fbl6,t3_1giuoza,1giuoza,[deleted],
lvbao4m,t3_1giuoza,1giuoza,Someone wrote a long comment about these pumpkins from Halloween being great for pumpkin pies last year. They said they had been using them to make delicious pumpkin pies even when other commenters stated they might not taste good and the pesticide problem as well. I was impressed by pumpkin pie being made from these Halloween pumpkins.     Thanks for the idea I have never ate a gourd before. I should see what they have at my local store.,
lv8fkgu,t1_lv8crne,1giuoza,"Are you saying the seeds used to grow decorative gourds were treated with antifungals, like at the beginning of the growing season? Most commercial seedstock is treated, including grocery store produce. You shouldn't consume treated seeds directly of course, but the fruit grown from the seed is fine to eat.

My family and friends have been eating the decorative gourds for years, it's tradition for me.
There are plenty of sources on social media as well: https://www.chefsresource.com/can-you-eat-gourds/?origin=serp_auto",
lva5yc6,t1_lv9icuy,1giuoza,"You are aware that ALL  grocery store produce has been treated with chemicals though, right? Unless you buy organic, all of your produce has been treated with carcinogenic pesticides: https://www.ewg.org/foodnews/dirty-dozen.php?origin=serp_auto",
lvcuz81,t1_lvciri5,1giuoza,"Hello and thanks for participating! You raise some good points, so if I may respond:

1. These specific plants have a hard, thick outer rind which is not edible, but the insides are edible. To prepare them, cut them into pieces and bake them, then scrape out the ""meat."" The inside is safe because any chemicals remain on the thick outer rind. Elsewhere in this thread I posted a link to the Environmental Working Group's Dirty Dozen list of the top produce contaminated with pesticides, and squash doesn't make the list because of the rind.
 

2. Many varieties sold as ""decorative"" gourds/pumpkins are actually heirloom varieties that have been around for hundreds of years and are much better eating quality than modern varieties. Some examples include Long Island Cheese pumpkins, Sibley squash, Nanticoke squash (pictured above), Hubbard squash, Musquee de Provence, and too many more to name. If you know, you know!
 

3. They are not rotten at all. Again, because of the hard thick outer rind, these plants can be stored for many months, and some heirloom varieties improve flavor during storage as the starches convert to sugars. These qualities made gourds/pumpkins very important food sources for many societies around the world before modern refrigeration was invented.",
lva9v33,t1_lva8dex,1giuoza,"So true!! üòÇ Unfortunately my local stores have started clearing out Halloween merchandise ON Halloween now, so they can put up Christmas stuff even faster. Also your username is brilliant lol",üòÇ
lvf6cpm,t1_lvf5cpj,1giuoza,"Same haha I had no idea this was going to be so controversial.

Classic Reddit moment I guess.",
lv8ouwn,t1_lv8khie,1giuoza,Pesticides probably. Some of them can be downright nasty.,
lv9ckg9,t1_lv8khie,1giuoza,"Actually on this picture almost all are pumpkins (except on the upper right maybe), the problem is that common language is imprecise about what is a gourd/squash/pumpkin.¬†


On the other hand a lot of the more strangely shaped cucurbits are cultivars of cucurbita pepo (zucchini, squash) but keeping more wild genes and toxins. Those one are potentially¬†toxic (usually they will also be really bitter).¬†",
lv95aqt,t1_lv8khie,1giuoza,"You can always ask, especially if it's a small market. They're not grown to be consumed, so they may not taste great due to growing conditions, but many of them can be eaten and they're really tasty.

Unfortunately, every single item of produce in grocery stores is also treated with pesticides, unless it's labeled organic. We eat tons of food grown with pesticides. https://www.ewg.org/foodnews/summary.php?origin=serp_auto it's something to be aware of, and buy organic when you can, but it's not something to worry about.",
lva3cly,t1_lv8768h,1giuoza,"if you wash them, and then wipe down with hydrogen peroxide or rubbing alcohol to kill spores, they will last longer... to make them last even longer , wipe with a thin coating of vegetable oil to seal them.",
lv8hog1,t1_lv8fbl6,1giuoza,"Some of them can be, for sure! But not all of them, some of these are heirloom varieties of squash which are surprisingly tasty. The ones that are round, or with orange or salmon colored flesh are great for pies.

For anyone who wants to experiment, I recommend baking them and tasting it first before you use it in a recipe to make sure it's enjoyable to eat.

It also helps to have an idea of what the edible ones look like, these are some examples from Baker Creek which is an heirloom seed company: https://www.rareseeds.com/store/plants-seeds/vegetable-seeds/squash-seeds/winter-squash-seeds",
lvcjl9o,t1_lvbao4m,1giuoza,"Definitely see what's in your area! There are so many different varieties, some of them aren't great for eating but some are delicious. Not sure if you saw this link I put in another comment, these are some heirloom varieties of pumpkins: https://www.rareseeds.com/store/plants-seeds/vegetable-seeds/squash-seeds/winter-squash-seeds It helps if you can identify the ones that taste really good.

In my area, stores sell the standard orange pumpkins and everything else is labeled as ""decorative"" or ""specialty."" If you're not sure how to choose, grab a random one and bake it, then taste test before you use it in a dish. Have fun!",
lv8l7xd,t1_lv8fkgu,1giuoza,Yes the seeds are treated with different chemicals for consumable food and decorative foods like pumpkins. The chemicals can vary depending on the end use. It‚Äôs says right on the commercial seed packaging danger not fit for human or livestock consumption. I used to grow pumpkins and had to be sure I got untreated. I personally will only buy produce from a grocery store. Some of the different varieties of pumpkins are imported and who knows what they‚Äôve been treated with.,
lvadh3c,t1_lv8fkgu,1giuoza,Why would you argue with someone who‚Äôs clearly has first hand knowledge of practices with the argument ‚Äúwell I did it so it must be safe.‚Äù,
lvadopv,t1_lv8fkgu,1giuoza,Do you really not have the ability to take a step back and think about what other qualified people are saying? You‚Äôre so set in your ways other people must be wrong and you must be right? Look up some actually decent resources instead of some crappy blogs that support what you‚Äôre saying. Look at both sides and then make an informed decision.,
lvardvi,t1_lva5yc6,1giuoza,yeah but it‚Äôs a whole different level for food not approved for human consumption.,
lvfvwe9,t1_lvcuz81,1giuoza,"People really be missing out on ‚Äúdecorative‚Äù gourds lol.

Oh well, more for us üòÖ.",üòÖ
lv9fgbp,t1_lv9ckg9,1giuoza,[deleted],
lva43jz,t1_lva3cly,1giuoza,"Great idea, thanks for the tip!",
lvbxjgc,t1_lv8l7xd,1giuoza,"I think that warning is for the actual seeds. Don‚Äôt eat the treated seeds. You‚Äôll see the same warning on corn seed that‚Äôs used to produce edible corn products and animal feed.

The pumpkins that grew from the treated seeds should be edible.",
lv92qoj,t1_lv8l7xd,1giuoza,Well crap I roasted the seeds from my pumpkin carving at least I know for next year,
lv8xivw,t1_lv8l7xd,1giuoza,"Well definitely don't eat the treated seeds like you would snack on a bag of pepitas from the gas station lol that's why they're labeled that way. I grow a garden at home as well, and some home gardeners choose to treat their seeds so they don't rot in the ground or get eaten by insects before they sprout. I don't bother treating my seed (partly because I'm a lazy gardener) but the crops grown from treated seeds are safe to consume.

The unfortunate fact is that grocery store produce is also treated with thousands of different pesticides throughout the growing season, unless you buy produce labeled ""organic."" You are already eating food grown with pesticides, some of which are known carcinogens, which is why the Environmental Working Group publishes studies for consumers: https://www.ewg.org/foodnews/summary.php?origin=serp_auto

>The average American eats about eight pounds of fresh strawberries a year ‚Äì and with them, dozens of pesticides, including chemicals that have been linked to cancer and reproductive damage, or that are banned in Europe.

>Strawberry growers also use jaw-dropping volumes of poisonous gases to sterilize their fields before planting, killing every pest, weed and other living thing in the soil. These pesticides don‚Äôt remain on the fruit when it‚Äôs sold in the supermarket, but they do put farmworkers and people living near fields at risk.

Squash doesn't even make the cut for the Dirty Dozen, a list of the most contaminated produce. I'm not saying this to scare anyone or cause anxiety, because there is currently no evidence that eating non-organic produce harms consumers at all. All the evidence says it's far better to eat non-organic produce than to avoid produce. But it is something to be aware of and choose organic when we can.",
lvfrj6g,t1_lv8l7xd,1giuoza,"I‚Äôm pretty sure you have just misinterpreted the warnings on those seed packets. The wording you have stated to be on the packet just means not to eat the treated seeds in the packet. Unless you have missed some context-giving text from the warning in the packet and it‚Äôs just some overcautious legal statement.

Im kinda baffled this has so many upvotes and OPs reply has so many downvotes lol, but     that‚Äôs Reddit lol.

Even *if* the seed packet had said something more specific like ‚Äúthe fruit of the plants grown from these treated seeds are unfit for human consumption‚Äù (which of course it didn‚Äôt say), that wouldn‚Äôt make any sense. Consider - how could there possibly be enough fungicide coating a single seed to dissolve into the soil and persist in that local patch of ground over a whole growing season in high enough concentrations to be absorbed and bioaccumulated in the growing plant without being degraded by temperature fluctuations /light/bacteria or washed away by irrigation? If any potentially detectable traces of that fungicidal chemical left ending up in the fruit are dangerous to humans - how ridiculously toxic would the coated seeds themselves have to be?  

At least in the UK/EU, eating shop bought pumpkins (and roasting the seeds) is fine. OP is not incorrect. Maybe they treat ornamental squash/pumpkins with toxic chemicals before sale in some regions of the world, but the seeds themselves having a small fungicide treatment before growing wouldn‚Äôt make the plant/fruit grown from it unsafe to eat.",
lvfstg6,t1_lvadh3c,1giuoza,"Because what they are claiming doesn‚Äôt sound logical if you have spent time researching agricultural chemicals, or otherwise have a high familiarity with biology/chemistry.

Why would you blindly trust a Reddit comment and believe someone ‚Äúclearly‚Äù has first hand knowledge of something without researching the topic yourself? :S",
lvfvbql,t1_lvardvi,1giuoza,"It‚Äôs the *seeds* in the packet that are not meant for human or livestock consumption - the plants grown from the seeds are fine unless they are also treated with further unsafe chemicals while/after growing.

The fungicidal coating from the seed would have to dissolve into the soil and bioaccumulate in the fruit at a high enough concentration for it to be toxic - this is not a concern. 

For all I know, some places in the world might treat ornamental fruit with toxic preservatives because they aren‚Äôt intended for human consumption  - but that‚Äôs not what is being discussed here.",
lvghdyi,t1_lvfvwe9,1giuoza,"Seriously! Thank you, the comments in this thread are blowing my mind, and not in a good way. Guess I'll be extra thankful when I eat my ""decorative gourd"" pie lol",
lv9glgy,t1_lv9fgbp,1giuoza,Why do you take that badly?,
lv9jwot,t1_lv92qoj,1giuoza,"Yeah uhh, I‚Äôve been doing this my entire life and so has basically everyone I know!",
lvgobtb,t1_lvfrj6g,1giuoza,"https://www.organicvoices.org/why-you-should-choose-organic-pumpkins/#:~:text=If%20you‚Äôre%20buying%20a,will%20contain%20these%20dangerous%20chemicals.&text=Pumpkins%20are%20known%20for%20cleaning,their%20ability%20to%20absorb%20chemicals.",
lvikyky,t1_lvgobtb,1giuoza,"That link doesn‚Äôt make a single mention of the fungicidal coating you have incorrectly stated to be dangerous. It‚Äôs just a website of a marketing organisation for organic produce. You are just totally wrong about the seed coating.

Nobody is going to claim that non-organic is better than organic, your wordless reply with that link hasn‚Äôt addressed the points made. I already addressed the issues discussed in the link in the last line of my reply.

Canned salsa like Heredez isn‚Äôt bad at all.

I get a baking mix (store brand bisquick) and make biscuits and pancakes. 

I bake my own bread, which is an upfront cost, especially yeast, but evens out week after week.

TVP is cheap protein. I‚Äôve made many a sloppy Joe from it and some store brand manwich.

I raised my son on Shut Up and Eat It, which was diced veg, brown rice/pasta and a sauce.

My fave version is based on pra ram tofu, which is peanut sauce over veg, but I often made it without tofu.",
lcqu6c6,t3_1e0zie9,1e0zie9,"If you have a bulk store (or a bulk bin aisle in a grocery store near you) that can be the cheapest way to get dry beans, grains, pasta, flours, uts, seeds, spices, dried herbs, and more.  You control the amount and you aren't paying for branding, marketing, packaging etc.

All purpose flour and baking powder are staples with which you can make flatbreads, pancakes, biscuits, pastas (spaetzle is the easiest kind) and more. 

Look for sales on store branded canned beans and chickpeas. They're already cooked, you just need to rinse them off and add them to rice or other dishes. 

Lentils are like beans but cook very quickly without the need for soaking or long boiling - excellent in soups, casseroles, tossed with rice, cold as salads... 

Seed butters, like tahini or sesame seed butter, in addition to nut butters.  

In-season veggies and fruit will be the cheapest and nicest, at any time of year.  This depends on where you are, of course. Apples, citrus, bananas tend to be cheap and available year round, as are cabbages, asian greens, potatoes (very versatile!), carrots and some other root veg.   Rely on frozen for out of season fruits and veg. 

Go to the library and look for books like Vegan on a budget, plant based on a budget, Thrifty Vegan, 15 minute Vegan, Fast Easy Cheap Vegan, Express lane vegan ... get lots of recipes and ideas.  There are also a few 'student vegan cookbooks' that are great for beginning cooks on budgets.  These dont require fancy equipment or huge kitchens, too. 

Chat GPT gives terrible recipes, can't test them, and has never tasted food.  If you must use online recipes, find trusted sources (budgetbytes, loveandlemons, eating well, post punk kitchen - these are my favourites).    Like [https://www.budgetbytes.com/category/recipes/vegetarian/vegan/](https://www.budgetbytes.com/category/recipes/vegetarian/vegan/)

And here are their tofu recipes: [https://www.budgetbytes.com/tag/tofu/](https://www.budgetbytes.com/tag/tofu/)  Tempeh, TVP, Seitan, nuts, many vegetables, legumes and seeds are also great sources of protein. 

And review their tips for budget meal planning and shopping, it's very useful stuff: [https://www.budgetbytes.com/budget-byting-principles/](https://www.budgetbytes.com/budget-byting-principles/)  You have a very tight budget, but there are infinite varieties of 'rice and beans' that can keep you full and healthy, along with many other options.

Make a free account on cronometer.com.   It will help you make sure that your are getting adequate nutrition.  If you are lacking in area, you can do a web search on ""Sources of vitamin xxx"".  Then just choose the cheapest one.

Public libraries often have vegan and vegetarian  cookbooks.

Do a web search on seasonal produce, and buy those items as they are the cheapest produce.

Frozen vegetables are often nutritionally the same or better than fresh produce.  They are cheaper.  You can often find frozen vegetables in dollar stores.

There are a lot of videos on YouTube with the theme ""living on just ____ a week"".  Some of those videos are also about vegan food.",
lcqxwsu,t3_1e0zie9,1e0zie9,"Green lentils, rice, and onions makes mujaddarah, which is a very healthy Middle Eastern vegan dish. 

By the way, buy your beans dried and learn how to cook them on the stove‚Äî it saves quite a lot of money. I would recommend going to the store once a month to stock up on dried goods (beans, flour, lentils, etc) and only go to the store weekly for the fresh vegetables you need each week. On 100/month you are unlikely to be able to afford soda, snacks, etc. Tofu is unlikely to be economical for you compared to beans & lentils, but double check with your local grocery. 

Don‚Äôt bother buying vegetable broth even if a recipe suggests it‚Äî most store-bought stuff doesn‚Äôt have much flavor to it anyways. *Do* buy salt and bay leaves to season your beans with. If there is an Asian or Indian grocery store near you, then you will find produce, spices, &etc. cheaper there than anywhere else. 

Look for 4-5 simple recipes, find the core spices they have in common, and buy them in bulk at your local natural grocer / ethnic grocery store. Usually that will be stuff like salt, pepper, cumin, oregano, ginger, curry powder, paprika, cayenne pepper, turmeric, & bay leaves. If recipes have fancy spices in small amounts you can usually leave them out for only a small decrease in overall flavor. 

With your budget I would highly recommend stews, soups, and curries as your primary form of food‚Äî IMO you can stretch food & money in that form than anything else. Check out RainbowPlantLife‚Äôs blog and the website budgetbytes for some very nice vegan food in these categories‚Äî I eat very cheaply using recipes like these. Your core vegetables are the cheapest store-brand crushed tomatoes you can find, alliums like garlic and onions, ginger, and canned coconut milk (ETA: plus a variety of beans and lentils, of course). I would also suggest some frozen peas or corn for variety but YMMV. You can grate carrots and add potatoes into your stews to bulk them up if they are on sale, and they often are.",
lcr6yh3,t3_1e0zie9,1e0zie9,do you have an asian market close by ? veggies and beancurd products usually much less expensive than at regular round eye grocery stores,
lcqsf11,t3_1e0zie9,1e0zie9,"I'm vegetarian, not vegan but I live pretty frugally with my food budget.

Cheapest meals for me are: pasta of all sorts, oatmeal, hot oat bran cereal w/ almond milk, cheap fruits like watermelon/bananas, cheap veggies like carrots/potatoes/cabbage/corn/cucumbers..

A 10 lb bag of potatoes is about $5 and can be made into a variety of things during the month.... baked potatoes, fries, mashed, hashbrowns, added to soups, etc. They go a long way!

Of course beans can be made into bean burgers too, not just used in burritos or beans-n-rice. 

Also, if you have a farmer's market near by!! They double your SNAP money. So tell them you want to spend $15 on your EBT, they will double that and will give you tokens to buy $30 worth of fruits/vegs instead! The tokens don't expire until the end of the year so you can use them a little at a time too.

These are just a few ideas. üíú",üíú
lcrkb6u,t3_1e0zie9,1e0zie9,"Get yourself to your local budget grocer. Walmart, Aldi, there are few grocery outlets in the south east. 

Hot cereal -Oats if you like them, I'm not a big fan so id prefer cream of wheat, malt o meal, or coco wheats. They're all relatively cheap, but oats can't be beat if you like them. These are all a source of cheap iron for you. 

See if you can find some mark down fruit produce for your hot cereal. Freeze and slice the fruit when you get home.  Bananas are a cheap alternative. 

Consider fortified Soy milk over almond milk or other milks. Soy milk has more protein , and added folate, and other nutrients. 

If you have the skills, get comfortable making your beans of choice from dry. My favorites are chickpeas/garbanzo beans and pinto beans.  Rinse them and soak them overnight. Then gently cook them. If you have a crockpot or instant pot this will be less intimidating for you.  If you're not comfortable look for canned beans. Walmart and Aldi tend to have the cheapest beans. Usually less than a dollar per can. If at Walmart check unit price and look at the larger cans. 

An Idea for some of your beans. 
My family makes a recipe called bean loaf. It's biscuit dough, usually a canned refrigerated dough, but you can make yours with Bisquick flour or make a simple yeasted bread dough. All will work.  Raw dough is laid out flat and 1.5 cups of cooked  mashed beans (usually pinto) are mixed with quarter cup of salsa. You can spread the bean mix on the dough like a pizza. This is baked in a 400f oven until the bread is cooked. Usually 20-25 minutes. It's served topped with any combination of hot sauce, fresh tomatoes, more salsa, raw onions, vegan cheese, and or avocado or guacamole. This is an easy make ahead lunch. 

Consider some peanut butter if you enjoy it for breakfast and sandwiches.
 
Consider store bought jelly- it's a cheap source of flavored sugar when you want to lightly sweeten your food especially breakfast . Also good for your pb j's. 

Pasta and rice.  You should get these from your discount grocery store. A five pound bag of rice , and some different shaped noodles will help with variety.  Try to see if you can get as close to a $1 per 16oz  of noodles. Prices vary. Ideas Pasta salad, pasta and tomato sauce, chickpea noodle soup, stir fried rice, rice pudding, rice congee, jambalaya, red beans and rice, Spanish beans and rice. 

Consider tortillas or sandwich bread. 

A few packets of soy ramen will be good to have on hand for when you just need quick food. You can throw in frozen veggies while it cooks. Also good for stir fry. 

Lentils- rinse and cook in 30 minutes. They're like instant beans.  Lentil soups are your friends. They'll take any scrap vegetables you have. Green/brown lentils are nice as a cold salad ingredient the next day as well. 

Make sure you have at least a few cheap spice mixes or hot sauces. Dollar tree stores can be great for this.  Pick what you think you'll want to eat often. For me that's Italian seasoning and a hot sauce. Sometimes the grocery deli has free take away sauce packets. Ketchup and mustard. Take a few. 

Potatoes are the ultimate belly fillers. Get yourself a big bag. -potato soup, potato salad, French fries, mashed potatoes, hash browns, home fries..... You get the idea. 

Find a cheap source of oil. Usually that's canola or vegetable oil. You'll need this because you're going to be eating otherwise very low fat foods. A little bit of oil cooked into your food, will make a boring dish better and edible. 

Herdez or other brands usually have cheap canned salsas and other flavoring canned bases. -i love the salsa Verde.  This is also has vegetables and flavor for your food. 

Cabbage, carrots and onions are awesome and will last a long time.  Don't underestimate sliced cabbage, it will add a crunchy texture you might be missing. Fresh spicy chilis can be had for a few pennies each. They add flavor if you like heat.  

Grab a few bags of frozen veggies. Look at the unit price per bag. Sometimes the bigger bag isn't always the cheapest.

lcrpuwa,t3_1e0zie9,1e0zie9,"Look into local farms, farmers markets, and CSAs. CSA stands for community supported agriculture - think local food box subscription. You buy into the CSA and, in return, get fresh produce every week/2 weeks. Many CSAs have the opportunity to work on the farm with the produce to help offset the price of the box as well as accept SNAP benefits. Many vendors at farmers markets also accept SNAP benefits. 

Try going later to farmers markets and asking the stands if you could have their ""seconds"" for less. Often times farmers bring more produce than necessary or some they consider ""ugly"". If they don't sell it at market, it likely goes back to the farm. And if not sold or eaten there, is likely composted or fed to animals. Many farmers don't like this perceived waste and would rather their food go to those who need it. Just ask, many will be glad to help those in need. This also allows you to make friends with farmers who can teach you to grow things!

Grow a garden! If you have some yard space, learn to grow veggies (with your new farmer friend)! Most veggies can even be grown in pots. You can just keep the seeds from your favorite produce and pop them into the soil.",
lcv1rrd,t3_1e0zie9,1e0zie9,"I'm sorry you're dealing with such a strict limit. Unfortunately beans and rice are about the cheapest price-per-calorie you can possibly get.

Still, that doesn't mean you have to eat plain beans and rice for every meal. My go-to is curry, as it's an easy way to make beans and rice palatable. Here's what I do:

* Bulk dried rice
* Bulk dried chickpeas (garbanzo beans)
* Get some tofu
* Get a head of broccoli (not frozen, frozen is more expensive per-pound)
* Get two cans of coconut milk
* Get green curry paste or indian simmer sauce (most expensive part of these meals)
* Get an instant pot on FB Marketplace, Craigslist, etc. for cheap (you can do all this on the stove, but it's so much easier with a digital pressure cooker)

Bulk cook and freeze your rice - I do 6 cups water and 6 cups rice in a pressure cooker. Do not rinse your rice, you're giving up a bunch of starch you want to eat. As soon as it's done, portion the rice in 1 cup portions into tupperware. Freeze it. If you freeze the rice right after cooking it, it will microwave back to being good. A cup of rice is around 200 calories, so 3 of these containers is 600 of your 2000 calories for a day, and we haven't even started on the ""real"" food yet.

Bulk cook and freeze your chickpeas - Same as with the rice. Cook dried chickpeas in bulk. This is so much easier if you have a digital pressure cooker like an instant pot. You can do it on the stove though, it just takes more time/work. As soon as they're done cooking, drain, rince, and freeze your chickpeas. 1.5 cups of chickpeas is the equivalent of a can of chickpeas but costs a tiny fraction of the price of the canned version.

Now for curry

Ingredients:

* 3 cups of chickpeas
* 2 blocks of tofu, cubed and pressed
* 1 head of broccoli chopped up into little florets. Clean up and chop up the stem too. It can go in with everything else.
* 2 cans of coconut milk
* 2/3 cup of green curry paste or 1 jar of indian simmer sauce. Can't swing the sauce? Use whatever spices you can manage. This is what's going to give your curry flavor though.

Toss all of this into a pot for 40 minutes. Stir from time to time (every 5 minutes or so). You can throw in the chickpeas frozen, it's fine, they'll melt during the 40 minutes if you start from cooked/frozen or canned.

Once cooked, portion it out in 1 cup increments into tupperware and fridge/freeze. You can reheat the curry and the rice in the microwave and they'll come out great. A minute and a half if refrigerated, 2-3 from frozen. Just cover the bowl so it steams while reheating and the rice won't dry out.

*This recipe makes around 12-16 servings*. When served with the rice it's around a 500 calorie meal. You could eat nothing but this by eating 4 servings per day. The chickpeas and rice mean it has a complete set of amenos, so you won't wind up malnourished.",

lcso4sv,t3_1e0zie9,1e0zie9,"I‚Äôve had to do this before. It‚Äôs hard, but possible. Everything you buy needs to be the highest possible density of nutrients per dollar. These are the things I‚Äôve found through lots of research and actual real life experience:

Dry organic soybeans are the best protein staple, if you‚Äôre in a city, you may be able to find them in a natural foods store or a place that sells bulk staples. Complete source of high quality protein, with also some carbs, and some fat. You soak them overnight, then boil them. If you have a blender, you can pur√©e the cooked beans to make a cream to add protein to smoothies, or thin it with water to make soy milk. 

Walnuts, help seeds, pumpkin seeds, and chia seeds are good sources of fat with additional nutrients as well as small amounts of protein.

Oatmeal is a good cheap source of carbohydrates and calories, and also has some fiber and protein.

Kale, broccoli, and arugula are the best easily available green vegetables for nutrient density. It‚Äôs best to eat them raw. Either as salads, or pur√©ed in a blender. If you drink them pur√©ed, lemon juice and zest and a bit of salt helps the taste.

Sweet potatoes and carrots are good sources of orange nutrients as well as calories from sugar and some fiber. Sweet potatoes are very good tasting if you roast them with the skin on in a 400¬∞ oven for about an hour (until they are soft and start dripping molasses and smell like toasted marshmallows)

Frozen blueberries are the are the highest density of nutrients per dollar of the widely available fruits.

A good recipe for eating cooked soybeans: fry some onions in coconut or olive oil until they are slightly caramelized, then add finely chopped garlic and ginger, cook for another minute or two, add curry powder, or garam masala, or just cumin seeds, and cook for a minute, add some tomatoes or tomato paste, the cooked beans, some water, and if you have them, add any vegetables you have (carrot, potato, peppers, cilantro, green beans, green peas, those all work pretty well). Cook it a bit longer until it reaches a consistency that you like.

For breakfast, you can mix oats and chia seeds (1cup oats to about 1/4cup chia seeds) with blueberry pur√©e, or canned coconut milk, or homemade soy milk. Let them soak overnight, and it will become a very filling breakfast. In the morning you can add nuts and fruit to it.",

lctyov4,t3_1e0zie9,1e0zie9,"My advice would be to split your budget into two bi weekly shops.

This sounds counter intuitive as buying in bulk is great but you will find that psychologically the impact of buying everything at once then watching the cupboards run dry as you try to plan your meals out that far in advance is not fun.

Having a bi weekly shop allows you to mix things up a bit more and also experiment with some stuff. You can do a larger shop at the start for the bulk items (rice, beans, oats, lentils, etc) and then a top up shop at the 2 week mark. This will allow you to add some variation to your diet and take advantage of reduced food items with shorter expiry dates.

Reduced food items are going to be the thing that allows you to have some fun and variation, so look for supermarkets which offer a reduced item section. I would go online and make a list using the online shopping to make sure you have the costs right. Then go in store and shop to the list. Leaving yourself some left over budget for reduced stuff.

Also you should investigate a few stores as you will find that they will each offer some items at much higher or lower costs. I like the Asian super market near me for bulk items way cheaper than the supermarket. But then the supermarkets offer fresh foods, frozen and reduced items at better value.

If you have a freezer you will want to batch cook. Tupperware is prohibitively expensive but you can find the cheap plastic takeaway containers for far less. Use those, batch cook and freeze. But don't go for too big sizes, nothing worse than cooking up 10 portions of something and you burn it or dump the entire salt packet in by accident. These things happen and most recipes are for 4. Following these until you are confident with your cooking is a good idea.

I hope this all helps. Going into this in the right headspace with a strategy that allows for some fuck ups and some treats will mean you not only survive but thrive. Good luck and remember, all things shall pass as will this.",

Similarly, visit a farmers market towards the end of the day, explain your situation and see if any of the vendors will cut you a deal for whatever produce they have left.

Look through your local circulars, every month buy some sort of spice or herb mixture, I highly suggest if you can, to try and grow some potted basil or other such herbs (some are super easy even in doors!).

Flour should always be your first purchase, you can do so much with it, it's incredibly what you can use it for, from thickening sauces, to making pancakes, breads and waffles. You can even wash it to make you're own seiten too!

It may seem really daunting at first, but taking one day to meal prep can really help. Make a large batch of pancakes and store them away, a few loafs of bread, you could make flatbreads too. Pasta.

Next is to really think about your purchases, you have a versatile starch that can make protein or a carb, for vegans I would think about what veggies you like best and again taking the time to prep instead of getting precut is a big saver!  
  
I love scallions every month they go on sale for .99 each, you have to scrub them but otherwise you could pickle them, saute them and freeze them or use them fresh. Think about the ways you could use them too!

I‚Äôve requested two reevaluations and I received both TADF and SNAP. You maybe eligible for the TADF payment which you need to apply for but that provides you with additional income 

Can you supplement by gardening? Might be worth trying to grow a few crops and can for cooler seasons to supplement SNAP

There are food banks you drive up to and they give donations to everyone who comes . Also look at programs you maybe eligible for on findhelp.org they have many amazing programs.

You need to make sure you‚Äôre getting the most out of your benefits!

My only tips for shopping would be you can make your own veggie burgers out of black beans. Tofu is great for seasoning, get some plain tofu and look up videos on how to cook it! Helps to remove the liquid to get it crispy 

You could use a block of tofu for several meals and season it accordingly 

Start too by visiting all the grocery stores in your area and comparing prices. In my state Market Basket is the cheapest and so often I‚Äôll see them selling say flour for two dollars cheaper than the same exact flour at say Roche Bros .. once you figure out what store is cheapest make a plan of how often you want to shop and your budget. Your going to get the best value for stocking up. Make a list of basic staples you want like rice, flour, spaghetti anything you‚Äôd keep in your pantry and maybe start by stocking up on one pantry item with you money and then the rest for meals. These pantry items can last a long time and they can be utilized for any meal. 

You can make your own vegan yogurt. I started saving money in Veganism when I realized how much I could make for myself and it‚Äôs healthier (vegan food doesn‚Äôt meant healthy! French fries in the right oil are vegan) 

I‚Äôd focus on then buying what‚Äôs on sale and using coupons. When I shop I only buy what‚Äôs on sale, get circulars for all the grocery stores. I look through the circular and make a list. Stick to your list and don‚Äôt grocery shop hungry! (If I go to the store hungry everything looks good and I buy too much lol) things like sweet potatoes, chickpeas, black beans. Get some canned / frozen veg and then buy what fresh produce you can 

Also many farmers sell things they call seconds ..it might be worth going to some farms asking if they have any seconds you could buy and if they don‚Äôt could see if you could leave your # and they could call you if you do. Seconds are usually half price the original product or more, there‚Äôs nothing wrong with them other than they may not be as pretty as the ones they sell in the store

Could even consider getting a job at a farm or grocery story part time  . You‚Äôd get a discount and when I worked at the farm they‚Äôd give me free stuff all the time 

Towards the end of the season we‚Äôd constantly having folks come in to guy boxes of tomato‚Äôs seconds to can . Then they‚Äôd have access to fresh grown tomatoes all winter long. Can use for sauces, stewed tomatoes etc 

I‚Äôd definitely start looking at the avenues I needed to live more independently. If your not working could apply for disability, there are reps who don‚Äôt charge unless you win and then they take a percentage of the back pay you‚Äôd get 

Don‚Äôt get discouraged and make sure you exploring all your options! Look into DTA works programs!",

l1rteo0,t3_1cfvtg3,1cfvtg3,Recipe??,
l1u5o4g,t3_1cfvtg3,1cfvtg3,"For everyone looking for a recipe, i roast a bunch of carrots, onion, garlic, maybe some sweet potato if I‚Äôm tired of peeling carrots(no measurements, only vibes). Then I put them in a pot, cover with veggie broth and blitz with my stick blender. You can use a regular blender too, just remember that the steam from hot veggies will increase the pressure inside, so let it cool and be careful to avoid having to clean pureed carrots off the ceiling. You can even use a fork or potato masher it just might not be quite as smooth.

Then I like to add salt, black pepper, turmeric, and curry powder (once again: vibes yes, measurements no). 

And once everything is blended and integrated, I might add some coconut milk for creaminess. Other kinds of plant milk can also work, or even a peeled white potato blended in (roasted with all your other veggies earlier - don‚Äôt add raw potato) can add some nice creaminess and texture. 

I also like to roast some canned or cooked chickpeas to put on top for a crunchy topping. (rinse, sheet pan, season to your liking, ~425F for as long as it takes them to brown up without burning, usually 25-30 min).",

Other common ingredients may include rosemary, garlic, white pepper, oregano, etc. It's kind of like curry powder, there are common ingredients but the specifics and proportions are unique to each blend.

To be honest, I skipped it here and just used plain ground sage by itself to add that ""herb"" flavor. I would encourage people to try different blends and see what they enjoy. No hard or fast rules, do what your taste buds prefer!",

Smart shopping is difficult and stressful, so I genuinely would appreciate any and all feedback. Thanks.

These are usually available at Asian grocery stores, which tend to also have cheap tofu. For rice noodles I like Erawan brand, which is about half the price of Annie Chun's.

**Veganism is not a diet**. However, there is a ton of misinformation and misunderstanding about the cost of **eating vegan** and this subreddit exists to hopefully dispell those false claims. Be advised submissions containing expensive processed food items will be removed.



**Definition of veganism:** *Veganism is a philosophy and way of living which seeks to exclude‚Äîas far as is possible and practicable‚Äîall forms of exploitation of, and cruelty to, animals for food, clothing or any other purpose; and by extension, promotes the development and use of animal-free alternatives for the benefit of animals, humans and the environment. In dietary terms it denotes the practice of dispensing with all products derived wholly or partly from animals.*

l0mqddb,t3_1c9nmtp,1c9nmtp,"While I understand you're not hiking/bikepacking, looking for information from those that go out without stoves might give you some ideas. It's called ""cold soaking"" and obviously add a vegan into the search terms, too. Instant potatoes, instant rice mixes, and couscous are all popular cold soak recipes. I'm not a huge fan, but I will cold soak things that kind of are meant to be cold. Like couscous or bulgar wheat into a pasta salad type of salad. 

I make overnight oats while bikepacking with canned coconut milk (check your dollar stores to get it cheap) to make it calorie dense, but it also works with water, just oats, shredded coconut, then add banana or mango in the morning. PB + any fruit + any nuts is good in it, too. If you find some dollar or cheap bulk store chia (rare, but it happens), can also add that in. 

I also buy dehydrated hummus and beans, but I order them in bulk online, so idk how feasible that is for you. Same with soy curls. 

I smash ramen packets, then mix them with a shredded cabbage mix, like for coleslaw. I use the packet as dressing, with some oil and vinegar. It's way better than you would expect. 

Trail mix can be cheap, especially if you have bulk stores near you to buy a little of a few things to mix yourself. I like to add cereal to mine, it bulks it up cheap and can be just as tasty dry. 

I mix up what I dip in my PB with apples and celery.

Bagels and hummus are pretty cheap. I usually buy some carrots or a cucumber at the same time to polish off the hummus with later in the day. You can then finish off the bagels with PB, too.",
l0mjb66,t3_1c9nmtp,1c9nmtp,"Probably not as cheap  but to mix it up, how about some canned chili or other bean-based soup? If you get it from Grocery outlet or similar markdown it could be quite cheap.",
l0mys11,t3_1c9nmtp,1c9nmtp,Nuts are always easy.,
l0ooc2h,t3_1c9nmtp,1c9nmtp,"Get some tortillas, add the peanut butter, and wrap around a banana",
l0n3ikl,t3_1c9nmtp,1c9nmtp,"Nuts and seeds like, peanuts, pepitas, sunflower seeds.  These all have a lot of protein, fiber and omega 3's too, so healthy and cheap with no cooking needed.  I know you are already eating peanut butter, but the other nuts and seeds are yummy too by the handful.",
l0qdv3y,t3_1c9nmtp,1c9nmtp,"Here are my top 25:

1. **Nuts and Seeds**: Almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, and pumpkin seeds are great choices. They provide protein, healthy fats, and are very filling.

2. **Dried Fruits**: Snacks like raisins, dried cranberries, and apricots offer a sweet, nutritious snack. Just watch for added sugars.

3. **Whole Grain Crackers or Rice Cakes**: These can be paired with spreads like almond butter or tahini.

4. **Granola or Cereal Bars**: Look for vegan bars that are high in fiber and protein but low in added sugars.

5. **Nutritional Yeast**: This can be sprinkled on any snack for a cheesy flavor and a boost of B vitamins.

6. ** Nutritional Protein Bars**: Look for bars that are specifically formulated with vegan proteins such as pea or rice protein.

7. **Canned or Pouched Beans**: These are ready-to-eat and can be found in varieties like chickpeas, black beans, or kidney beans. They're great for adding to salads or eating as is.

8. **Apples and Bananas**: Continuing with simple fruits that are nutritious and easy to store.

9. **Ready-to-Eat Canned Meals**: Look for vegan soups or chili that are satisfying even when eaten cold.

10. **Vegan Meal Replacements**: These are often designed to be consumed directly from the container and can provide a balanced nutrient intake on the go.

11. **Textured Vegetable Protein (TVP)**: This dehydrated product is an excellent source of protein and can be rehydrated with cold water if necessary, though it's often better with hot.

12. **Edamame**: Available in dried forms, these are whole, immature soybeans that are naturally high in protein and fiber.

13. **Hemp Seeds**: These can be eaten raw or sprinkled on any food for a protein boost and essential omega fatty acids.

14. **Chia Seeds**: Add these to any liquid (like water, juice, or apple sauce) for a gel-like snack that's high in protein and omega-3 fatty acids.

15. **Protein Powders**: There are various vegan protein powders available, such as pea protein, rice protein, and hemp protein, which can be mixed with water or juice.

16. **Roasted Chickpeas**: Available ready-to-eat, they're crunchy and high in protein and fiber.

17. **Lentil Snacks**: Lentil chips or crisps are available in many stores and provide a good protein alternative to regular chips.

18. **Seaweed Snacks**: While not as high in protein as other options, they are a good snack with some protein and a lot of minerals.

19. **Trail Mix**: Make your own mix with a variety of nuts, seeds, and perhaps some vegan dark chocolate for a satisfying protein-rich snack.

20. **Vegan Jerky**: Made from ingredients like soy, mushrooms, or wheat gluten, this is a flavorful and portable high-protein snack.

21. **Spirulina**: This blue-green algae is a superfood powder that can be added to smoothies or juices and is remarkably high in protein.

22. **Soy Nuts**: Roasted soy nuts are a crunchy, high-protein snack that can be enjoyed on their own or added to trail mixes.

23. **Pea Snacks**: Like roasted chickpeas, these are made from peas and are baked or fried to create a crispy, protein-rich snack.

24. **Nut and Seed Butters**: Almond, cashew, and sunflower seed butters are rich in protein and healthy fats, and they don‚Äôt require refrigeration before opening, making them practical for on-the-go eating.

25. **Pumpkin Seed Clusters**: Some brands offer clusters of pumpkin seeds with spices and seasonings, which are high in protein and healthy fats.",

l0n8brg,t3_1c9nmtp,1c9nmtp,"Oats with dates and whatever nuts or seeds you can get on sale and with chopped banana and/or apple. (Sunflower seeds are pretty inexpensive and are quite healthy.)

Bananas are cheap. I‚Äôd suggest buying them in varying degrees of edibility (from green to ripe) so they don‚Äôt all ripen at once. 

Apples keep a while as long as you don‚Äôt bang them around.

One of my local supermarkets stocks inexpensive canned hummus. That would work with whole wheat pita. 

Is access to a microwave oven possible? That would open up a lot of possibilities. Can you boil water or get access to boiled water?",

You can get small amounts at bulk food stores (although it‚Äôs worth getting larger budget bags of the ones you use most from supermarkets). I like to have crushed red pepper, dried garlic, black pepper, parsley, basil, dried onion, cayenne, cumin, cinnamon, etc. handy.

Onions and garlic keep well, too, and can be cut or crushed into a dish to make it more tasty. They‚Äôre cheap.",
l0qk850,t3_1c9nmtp,1c9nmtp,"After reading more of your comments I have some no-cook recipe and meal ideas. I realize it would be hard to clean up a bunch of tools so in your case I‚Äôd recommend disposable (biodegradable if possible) utensils and plates/bowls/cups for now. 

With that in mind here are some simple, high-calorie vegan meals that are shelf-stable and require no cooking or refrigeration:

1. **Nut and Seed Butter Sandwiches**: In addition to peanut butter, you can try almond butter, cashew butter, or sunflower seed butter. Spread these on whole grain bread or crackers for added nutrients and fiber.

2. **Vegan Wraps**: Use a whole grain or spinach tortilla, spread your choice of nut butter or a shelf-stable vegan spread like tahini, and add dried fruits (like raisins or cranberries) and nuts. You can also add pre-packaged, shelf-stable tofu for extra protein.

3. **Trail Mix**: Create your own mix with a variety of nuts, seeds, dried fruits (like apricots, dates, or figs), and some dark chocolate chips for a calorie-dense snack.

4. **Canned Bean Salad**: Mix canned beans (like chickpeas or black beans) with canned corn and a squeeze of lime or lemon juice (from a plastic lemon, which doesn't require refrigeration). Add spices such as chili powder or cumin for flavor.

5. **Overnight Oats**: If you have access to water, you can make overnight oats by soaking rolled oats in water overnight with dried fruits and nuts. Oats can absorb water at room temperature, making them edible without cooking. Any sealable container would work for this like a water bottle or mason jar. 

6. **Dried Fruit and Nut Bars**: Look for high-calorie, nutrient-dense bars that are often marketed to hikers and outdoor enthusiasts.

7. **Shelf-stable Hummus and Crackers**: Some brands offer shelf-stable hummus in single-serving packages, which can be a good source of protein and fiber when paired with whole grain crackers.

8. **Veggie Chips and Guacamole**: Some stores sell shelf-stable guacamole in single-serving packs. Pair these with veggie chips for a tasty, nutritious snack.

9. **Tahini and Molasses Mix**: Mixing tahini (sesame seed paste) with molasses can create a sweet, high-calorie spread or dip for bread or fruit. 

10. **Chia Pudding**: Combine chia seeds with water or a plant-based milk substitute (shelf-stable packages are available), and let sit until the chia seeds have absorbed the liquid and become gelatinous. Add dried fruits and nuts for flavor and extra energy.

11. **Rice Cakes or crackers with Avocado**: While fresh avocados do not require refrigeration until ripe, you can use them atop rice cakes along with a sprinkle of salt and pepper or other spices for a quick meal.

12. **Vegan Jerky**: Many health food and specialty stores carry vegan jerky made from ingredients like soy, seitan, or mushrooms. This can be a great portable, high-protein snack.

13. **Nutritional Yeast**: Sprinkle nutritional yeast on popcorn or mix with nuts and seeds for a savory snack that's rich in B vitamins.

14. **Canned Dolmas**: These are grape leaves stuffed with rice and herbs, commonly found in the international foods aisle. They are ready to eat right out of the can and are a satisfying meal or snack.

15. **Shelf-stable Plant Milk and Cereal**: Packets of plant-based milk (like almond, soy, or oat) that are shelf-stable can be a great accompaniment to a box of whole-grain cereal.

16. **Instant Couscous**: Although it typically requires hot water, couscous can absorb room temperature water slowly. Mix with canned vegetables and spices for a more substantial meal.

These ideas can help you maintain a varied and nutritious diet even in challenging circumstances. Best of luck, I hope things get easier for you.",

With that, you could pop into a grocery store before you‚Äôre about to do some doordashing, buy a couple of individual vegetables, chop them and throw them into the lunch box in a container with a little water. You‚Äôd have steamed vegetables by the end of work. The smaller you chop them, the faster they‚Äôll cook.

You could also use that to heat water and make tea.

If that‚Äôs not in the budget right now, there are still vegetables that can be bought by the pound in very small quantities right before a meal, and eaten raw. Carrots would be a good one.

Other money saving things: 
If you‚Äôre in Florida, oranges are abundant! Im in CA and I‚Äôve seen some groups where people will post to allow others to come harvest their citrus trees and keep the fruits for free. Because there‚Äôs just too much for a single person/family to go through and the fruits will go bad anyways. Maybe something you can look into in FL to get free fruit! Facebook groups or something.

Buy applesauce in single-serve containers, always look for the ""baby foods"" section of the grocery store (embarrassing, perhaps, but those foods are usually kinda cheap).

If there are nuts, such as pecans, that fall from trees nearby, then take full advantage of any of them that are on the ground and unclaimed.

Also, be on the lookout for veggie chips; they are usually expensive, but I used to go to a food bank, and they handed them out for free (if that's an option).

Also, be on the lookout for canned fruits too, as well as sometimes there are vegan pastries in stores.

And finally, if it comes down to necessity: ramen noodles are cheap, can be eaten without cooking them; they can go well with canned veggies, you could add spices... (The problem, of course, is the darned flavor packet; give those away to food banks or whatever, if it gets that desperate.)",

What counts in the end is the number of calories you eat in a day.",
lw62t3v,t1_lw53l6r,1gmo37k,">***TLDR;*** *I'm not saying all of this to convince you to eat oats, you eat what you want to eat, but you're demonising a good food source over your own fears and a medical doctor who isn't a nutrition expert but seems to be filling your mind with misinformation, if it helps, the top 3 food sources high in complex carbs, fibre and protein with the lowest amount of calories is Legumes (Beans, Lentils, Chickpeas...), Quinoa and Oatmeal, and if you consume white rice, you're technically eating something worse than oats for weight management. I suggest seeking out therapy/dietitian to help you overcome this fear.*

Doctors typically spend up to 15 years in medical school and usually spend less than 20 hours of their entire education on nutrition, their knowledge is very limited in this area and most of them don't stay up to date with this information, which is why you would be referred to a dietitian and not a medical doctor when it comes to your dietary needs.

As for weight management, it's all about your calories in and calories out, you can eat quite literally anything you want and gain or lose weight if you eat less/more calories than you burn, the part that makes you win/fail at weight management are the macronutrients.

Oats aren't a complicated grain, they contain more fibre than other grains and when it comes to weight loss or managing our weight, oats are a wonderful food source. Now, other than calories, there are 4 things we need to focus on when it comes to managing our weight.

1. Protein (most satiating, we should aim for a high intake)
2. Fibre (promotes fullness, this is paired with carbs)
3. Fats (promotes satiety, we should aim for a moderate intake)
4. Carbs (brains/body fuel, this should be adjusted based on our activity level/needs)

While carbs and fibre go hand in hand, some foods contain high amounts of carbs with very little fibre, oats isn't one of those foods, in fact, oats is number 1 when it comes to being the best combination of carbs, fibre and protein, here's a list of the top 3 best grains for of carbs, fibre and protein.

1. **Oats** are a source of complex carbs and slow-releasing, while also giving us lots of fibre for sustained energy and gut health, they also provide a good amount of protein.
2. **Quinoa** technically a seed but is grouped with grains and is a complete protein, it also boasts a good amount of fibre and also a good source of iron and magnesium.
3. **Brown rice** apart from carbs and fibre, it's also a good source of magnesium, selenium and manganese.

Honourable mentions...

* **Amaranth:** another complete protein with a good source of fibre and iron.
* **Teff:** same as Amaranth but also a good source of calcium.
* **Buckwheat:** while technically a fruit seed, it's a good source of protein, fibre and manganese.

Even when it comes to other food sources with good carbs, fibre, protein and lower calories, oats are still in the top 3, the first two being Legumes *(Beans, Lentils, Chickpeas...)* and Quinoa.  
  
Overall, oats are one of the best food sources to include in one's diet for weight loss/management, if you truly have a fear of a food source like oats because you're worried about gaining weight, then you should maybe consult a therapist or a dietitian as it sounds like you need to work on your relationship with food.

To hopefully help you understand why you shouldn't fear oats, when compared to oats, white rice is not the healthiest choice for weight management, now I'm not saying white rice is bad but when compared to your fear of oats, if you consume white rice, you're consuming something that is technically worse for weight management than oats, there are other food sources out there that you may consume which is worse than oats for weight management, the difference may not be significant, but the point is that oats should be the least of your worries when it comes to weight gain.

If weight gain is a genuine concern then focus on counting calories, you'll eventually familiarise yourself with the portions and start making meals without needing to count.",
lwfmyk7,t1_lw53l6r,1gmo37k,"I'm sorry you're getting downvotes for simply telling your story.  I can see taking in what your doctor said when you were 14, but don't forget, while doctors may have a broad impressive range of knowledge, they aren't known for their knowledge of nutrition, at one point I remember seeing they have 1 class in nutrition?  I hope that has changed.  I know the doctor I currently have actually told me to let food be my medicine.

I'm sure you can live a long full happy life and never eat oats, but now that you are an adult, maybe one day in the future do your own research.‚ô•",‚ô•

I'm always worried about burning the roux, but yours was chocolate brown color? Is that how you usually make it?",

lsv7kbd,t1_lsu84rv,1g7qa2w,"Used to make gumbo for work‚Äî you want the roux to be a nice dark chocolate color, start cooking it on medium-low and turn it down to low once it‚Äôs the color of a light espresso shot to keep it from burning. Whisk constantly because it‚Äôs REALLY easy to go from a deep nutty toast flavor to acrid and burnt. It can take a while to finish but is very much worth it for the flavor a good roux imparts to the soup. 


We did about a 1:1 flour/fat ratio if I remember correctly, just enough to keep the entire roux toasting the whole time. 


If it‚Äôs too light it won‚Äôt bind the oils to the stock and you can end up with a layer of unincorporated fat on top of the gumbo that starts forming as soon as it cools. 


It sounds harder than it is, it IS a bit of a pain while you build up confidence but just plan on losing a roux or three when you first start dialing it in. You may lose 20 minutes of work, but it‚Äôs way better than running with a burnt roux and ending up with a pot of gumbo you can‚Äôt convince yourself to finish because it tastes like ash.",
lsvd77y,t1_lsu84rv,1g7qa2w,Yes it's meant to be a very dark brown similar to milk chocolate. If you are concerned I would look up what a dark roux is meant to look like online. This recipe is kinda a mix-up between Japanese curry and gumbo because both are thick flavourful sauces thickened with roux and served over rice. Most gumbo doesn't have tomato paste in it and the mix could easily be played with by using different spices or even substituting the broth for something like cashew or coconut milk. I also suggest adding fresh peppers and celery if you have them. Have fun and mix things up.,

m550qzn,t1_m538bst,1hs41jx,"Couldn't agree more. 
An interesting historical fact: Rice was introduced to Italy during the Middle Ages. Early recipes for risotto, particularly during the Renaissance, used simpler ingredients like broth, onions, and saffron (e.g., Risotto alla Milanese). The heavy use of butter and cheese likely became prominent later as dairy farming expanded and these ingredients became more accessible.
Butter and cheese additions are mostly a Northern Italian thing where dairy is more abundantly used in the regional cuisine.",

m5a3fqv,t1_m59kjvz,1hs41jx,"Arborio or Carneroli is certainly worth looking for. It is a hard, shortgrain rice that gives a creamier result, hence the 35 minute cooking time. It does cost about double more than long-grain rice though. Something I must mention is that the cooking time for long-grain rice will be shorter, and takes less liquid than arborio does, but the result is still delicious. I have used long-grain rice often and the idea came to me because I know a Portuguese recipe called Arroz de Tomate and the Mexican Arroz Rojo that uses ordinary rice. The result is different than using Arborio rice, but so what? There are as many rice dishes as there are rice types, and all with similar or different results. Last season we made a black rice and exotic mushroom pilaff/risotto at a restaurant I consult for and it was just the bees knees. We had to can it in the new season because it was just too expensive to produce, and I am talking way more than even their most expensive meat dish. Black rice is not called Royal Rice for nothing. And of course, then there is Paella; you really should try Gaz Oakley's Vegan Paella. It is top drawer - even my meat loving relatives in Denmark loved it.

m5eg8ne,t3_1htm3ss,1htm3ss,"off the bat, im seeing an awesome tofu scramble with the mushrooms and onions. sautee the latter two things till theyre tender, add tofu, cook till youre happy with it. season however you want. 

if you can branch out to other legumes, chili would be something suitable i think too. peppers are cheap, as is chili powder, and youve already got onions. 

lettuce can make a good wrap/bread sub, if the mayo is something you like, tofu sandwiches might be fire. or even hot dogs? havent tried that one, but aye maybe itd be good. mustard is cheap, especially at walmart. 

and honestly, nothing fancy, but id eat the onions sauteed with the chickpeas on their own, add some mushrooms for some substance and flavor. this would also be good in a lettuce wrap, or over a salad. 

i think those are green onions? you can throw those on anything i just mentioned, theyre an awesome topping.",
m5ei48k,t3_1htm3ss,1htm3ss,"Ok I have a bunch of ideas. My favorite way to eat chickpeas is to boil them in a saucepan with a little bit of water (just enough to barely cover them) until the water's gone, and then add spices or whatever else (sometimes I add cornstarch and olive oil to make it crispy). I think from your description you can eat brown rice, which goes great with this. Also avocado.

Just from looking at this I feel like you could pull of a sort of simple chili situation by doing the basic chickpea thing I just mentioned on the stove and adding chopped hot dogs, tomatoes (if that's what I'm seeing in the back), and lots of spices (lots of chili powder, some cumin, maybe even taco seasoning if you have it, salt, pepper, red chili flakes, hot sauce, etc.). Serve with brown rice.

One of my favorite foods is ""tuna"" salad made from chickpeas (I call it ""chuna"" salad lol). Mush up some chickpeas with a fork (or a stand mixer works as well) and add vegan mayo, pickle relish, salt, pepper, and whatever else you think sounds good (I add lemon juice, sriracha, and dill). I usually scoop the ""tuna"" salad into bell pepper sections (just pull 'em apart) to make little boats. It's really crunchy and refreshing and filling.

This one might go without saying but pan-fry the tofu (assuming that you have extra-firm) and make it a stir fry with mushrooms and leeks (? I think those are leeks, but if it's somehow bok choy, all the better). I have found the best way to pan-fry tofu without too much oil or time spent pressing is to chop it up into squares and put it in a pre-heated ceramic frying pan, don't touch it, and let it cook until the water is done cooking out. Then you can add olive oil and spices. For a stir fry with tofu and mushrooms and leaks, I'd add soy sauce, sesame oil (you only need a tiny bit), sesame seeds. I would add more vegetables to this idea though like broccoli, carrots, celery, cabbage, green onions, etc. Serve with brown rice.

If you get super soft tofu, you can also literally just add soy sauce and eat it with a spoon and it's good. I'd imagine you would also want to add green onions, sesame oil, furikake, etc. I can't remember what this is called but I obviously did not make that up LOL.

Good luck!",

Tofu scrambles are an excellent option! Also if you have access to a blender, you throw a can of chickpeas in the blender then use that for chickpea scramble.

Also, if those are fresh tomatoes in the back, do a chickpea curry. Start by sauteeing the white parts of the leeks, add fresh tomato chunks and cook down, add curry powder (or similar spices) and mix for a minute until it's dry and a bit pasty, then add a can of chickpeas and enough water or broth to cover. Heat through and serve.",
m5fd0wx,t3_1htm3ss,1htm3ss,"Ok it all depends on how many spices you can use, but id reccomend indian cuisine. 

Make a Marsala, heat it up in a bit of oil and put spring onions, Garlic and mushrooms in the pan with it. Keep on frying but be careful not to burn it. When perfect add finely diced tomatoes to it and add a full can of chickpeas to it. Thats pretty much it!
If you need reccomendation for the spice Marsala just let me know!",
m5gktkn,t3_1htm3ss,1htm3ss,"Make some hummus or other bean dip/spreads, I like refried beans in rolled tacos, corn tortillas are whole grain, or you can buy keto/high protein wraps too.

I like bean and veggie based soups/stews/chili/curries, make a lot and freeze the excess in 1-2 meal sized portions, so you don‚Äôt have to eat the same thing for a week!  Minestrone, split pea, navy bean, lentil dal.  Use a little soy chorizo for flavor, I keep some in my freezer, along with frozen bags of chopped onion, celery, and bell peppers‚Äî this makes meal prepping super fast, esp for IP or slow cooker.  Better to cook up ingredients and assemble easy meals.

Top salads with beans, whole grains, chopped fruit, nuts/seeds, cooked tofu.  Roast beans in oven until crispy and spice up savory or sweet for a protein snack.  Make bean burgers, quite delicious.  Soak red lentils and water and salt and blend, makes a sort of crepe/pancake.

We will cook a big pot of brown rice and freeze the excess too.  Eat beans and rice, burrito bowls with toppings, or the Asian type Buddha bowls with toppings.  Fried brown rice, add to soups, brown rice salad, or dense bean salads.  

Tofu scrambles.  Mapo tofu or stir fried with veggies.  Soy crumbles or TVP.",
m5huga5,t3_1htm3ss,1htm3ss,"For the hot dogs, I would recommend trying them baked.  

Add them to a baking tray (best to have something under them like silicone or parchment paper).  

Slice them down the center, like you are making them into hot dog buns.  

Add condiments into the created space (including the mayo if you want and even some vegan cheese if you have some).  

Bake at 400¬∞ for about 20 minutes.  Yumm",
m5efhyj,t3_1htm3ss,1htm3ss,"

A lentil chili could be a good place to start since it's relatively cheap, easy to cook, and freezer friendly so if you want to make a huge batch and freeze into pre-portioned servings you can.

m5g06pg,t3_1htm3ss,1htm3ss,"# Winter Root Soup

* 1 carton of low-sodium vegetable stock
* 1 can of Great Northern beans
* 1 cup of lentils
* 1 cup of celery and onion blend
* 1 cup of sliced carrots
* 1 cup of sliced mushrooms (preferably crimini)
* 1 cup of diced turnip
* 1 cup of diced or sliced parsnips
* As much minced garlic as you want
* Ground cumin, corriander, allspice, and Italian seasoning (other seasonings you desire as well)
* Fresh thyme and rosemary
* Optional: shredded kale, liquid smoke

1. Roast the carrots, parsnips, and turnips in the oven at 350F for 15 minutes. You can drizzle a little olive oil and season them with anything you want. When they're done, remove them from the oven and set them aside.
2. Bring the vegetable stock to a boil (if you decide to use the liquid smoke, add a few drops of this to the stock). Once it boils, bring it to a low simmer and add the cumin, corriander, allspice, and Italian seasoning (as well as any other seasonings you desire). Salt to taste.
3. Add the lentils and let it cook for 5 minutes, stirring occasionally.
4. Add your mushrooms to the pot. Let the mushrooms turn slightly translucent before adding the other ingredients.
5. Add your minced garlic, celery and onion blend, and Great Northern Beans. Let this simmer for 5 minutes.
6. Add your roasted root veggies. Let this simmer for 2 minutes or so.
7. Add fresh thyme and rosemary. Cover and let simmer for 5 minutes.
8. Uncover and you're done! OPTIONAL: If you choose to use the shredded kale, add that in as a garnish after plating the soup.",
m5g8tgc,t3_1htm3ss,1htm3ss,That looks like an amazing curry to me.,
m5gf833,t3_1htm3ss,1htm3ss,"*Note:  I can't give you the amounts for the ingredient, these are just ideas, so the spices is something that you'll have to gradually add and taste, also onion/garlic powder can be replaced with fresh onion/garlic, with garlic I always use my heart, even if a recipe only calls for 1 clove, I sometimes add 4 or 5 lol. Anyway, here are a few ideas based on the restrictions mentioned, including your ingredients. Also, if you don't want to include oil, you can skip it, the mushrooms and leaks will release their own moisture but if needed you can add some water to help with the cooking process. All of this information is based on the assumption that you can cook with/without oil.*

**Lightlife Smart Dog**

*You could add the smart hot dog to a tofu scramble or a curry, just cook and chop them up into tiny pieces, but a simple way to use this with what you have, would be a quick salad, all you'd really need is some lettuce and red cabbage, you already have beans, carrots and mushrooms, just shred everything and then cook the beans and mushrooms (you can slice them up, and boil them until all the water evaporates or cook them whatever way you like), then add the Mayo, salt and pepper or whatever other herbs/spices you have that would go well with the salad.*

*You could also use a lettuce leaf to replace the hot dog bun, so cook up some mushrooms and carrots, if possible, throw in some diced onion, then roll up your hot dogs with the mushroom, shredded carrots, diced onion, mayo, salt and pepper (optional) and there you have a ""hot dog"", again any spices you have at home would help make this taste even better but use whatever you have available.*

**Tofu Scramble with Mushrooms & Leaks** 

Check out [rainbowplantlifes' tofu scramble](https://rainbowplantlife.com/eggy-tofu-scramble/), then just add in the mushroom & leaks or attempt the following.

**Ingredients:**

* Azumaya tofu (crumbled)
* whole mushrooms (sliced)
* leeks (sliced)
* nutritional yeast
* onion powder
* garlic powder
* salt/pepper
* A little olive oil

**Instructions:** Saut√© leeks and mushrooms in olive oil until softened. Add crumbled tofu and cook until heated through, breaking it up with a spatula. Stir in nutritional yeast (if using), onion powder, garlic powder, salt, and pepper to taste. Enjoy as is, or serve with a side of steamed carrots. 

*Note: you could also add some water/plant-milk to this, similar to rainbow plant life's recipe, to add moister if needed.*

**Chickpea & Vegetable Curry**

**Ingredients:**

* Chickpeas (drained and rinsed)
* whole mushrooms (sliced)
* leeks (sliced)
* carrots (sliced)
* broth (vegetable broth or water with bouillon)
* Curry Powder
* Turmeric
* ginger
* Garlic powder (or fresh garlic if available)
* Salt and Pepper

**Instructions**: Saut√© leeks and carrots in a little oil (e.g., olive oil, avocado oil) until softened. Add mushrooms and cook until tender. Stir in chickpeas, curry powder, turmeric, ginger, garlic powder, salt, and pepper. Add enough broth to create a saucy consistency. Simmer until heated through and flavours meld. Serve with brown rice if it's something you can consume or enjoy it as is.

In regard to your situation, not all carbs are equal, it could be that your body is having a bad reaction to the simple carbs (white rice, white bread, pasta etc...) but the complex carbs (brown rice, whole wheat pasta etc...) could be fine since your body process these foods differently, but this is something you'll have to figure out, also consider looking up substitutes for things you  can't eat and instead replace your meals with those items, similar to my suggest of replacing bread with lettuce for your hotdogs, it's also something we do with meat, we replace it with tofu, seitan, tempeh or tvp.  
  
Anyway, I hope you're seeking medical help for your situation, and I wish you the best for 2025.",

\- 1 onion, chopped

\- 4 cloves garlic, minced

\- 1 teaspoon turmeric powder

\- 1 zucchini, chopped

\- 1 bell pepper, chopped

\- salt & pepper

1. cook onion till almost soft in broth or a little oil.
2. add garlic and other veggies and cook for a couple minutes.
3. Add all remaining ingredients- Use only as much broth as needed to make it a stew-like consistency.
4. Bring to a boil and then let simmer about 10 minutes or depending on how crisp or tender you like your veggies.

Veggies: Broccoli and Capsicum / Bell Pepper.


Then you just need to find a sauce that matches that, for that one perhaps Soy sauce, Garlic, Chilli.

Peanut butter or apple cinnamon baked oatmeal

Mushroom and leek soup

This roasted root vegetable stew (I haven't tried it with fresh tomatoes, but I've used plain tinned rather than fire roasted and it is just as yummy - adjust spices to taste).

Quinoa salad with corn, tomatoes, onions, maybe a few chickpeas, black beans are better if you can get them.

If you have/can get coconut milk and curry powder/sauce you have chickpea and tofu curry.  Could add in potatoes and green peas as well.

I've made chili using tofu in place of ground meat crumbles.  It's an all day sort of labor of love but it's sooo worth it.  

If you have the right condiments you could try a spicy peanut tofu.  I've made the recipe from Budget Bytes before and it's pretty yummy.

**Veganism is not a diet**. However, there is a ton of misinformation and misunderstanding about the cost of **eating vegan** and this subreddit exists to hopefully dispell those false claims. Be advised submissions containing expensive processed food items will be removed.



**Definition of veganism:** *Veganism is a philosophy and way of living which seeks to exclude‚Äîas far as is possible and practicable‚Äîall forms of exploitation of, and cruelty to, animals for food, clothing or any other purpose; and by extension, promotes the development and use of animal-free alternatives for the benefit of animals, humans and the environment. In dietary terms it denotes the practice of dispensing with all products derived wholly or partly from animals.*

lw6tmzh,t3_1gmy0dw,1gmy0dw,Yet another post without a recipe,
lw6u9my,t1_lw6fh8a,1gmy0dw,"Hi! It‚Äôs really simple and just make use the ones I have at the fridge.


For the filling, I mashed the tofu in a pan in low heat to reduce water, but if you have airfryer, that would be easier. Then once it‚Äôs golden brown, saut√© garlic and onion, add carrots, light soysauce, oyster sauce and pepper to taste then set aside.

For the leaf, I just blanch it to a boiling water to cook the edges. Then roll the filling to it.

For the peanut sauce, i just mix the following. It‚Äôs a trial recipe but maybe you can add any other ingredient that you think will be suited to your taste. 

Peanut butter,
Oyster sauce,
Light soy sauce,
Dark soy sauce,
Vinegar,
Pepper,
Sugar,
Chili oil,
Garlic",
lw6ugvg,t1_lw6fh8a,1gmy0dw,"But for a more organized recipe, I suggest this one ‚ò∫Ô∏è

lw8598p,t1_lw6u9my,1gmy0dw,Oyster sauce isn't really vegan so substitute would be needed.,

lw86lax,t1_lw8598p,1gmy0dw,A little tamarind paste would work lovely üëå,üëå
