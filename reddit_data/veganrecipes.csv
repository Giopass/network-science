veganrecipes,"Ok, so I'm not trying to troll. This is a honest comment. Feel free to remove the post, mods, if you think that it doesn't belong here. So I'v been 99 percent vegan for almost four years now, and was a lacto-ovo vegetarian for 25 years prior to that. For many years I ate meat on a very few festive occasions in order not to upset my mother, until it started feeling strange doing that. I've always been extremely interested in good food (when I go to a new place I always seek out the best vegan restaurant and try their menu, and I love cooking at home).

Here's the ting: I've been trying hard for many years to start liking seitan. I've made it many times myself, in various ways (wtf and other methods). I've been served it by vegan friends. I've tried it out in several restaurants, including rather expensive vegan restaurants all across Europe who tend to know their stuff. 

And my conclusion is that seitan just isn't that good. To me it ALWAYS has a slight aftertaste of - well - seitan. And the texture also has someting strange to it. If you compare it to the best comercial meat replacements - impossible or beyond, oumph, smoked tofu, some mushrooms, 3D printed vegan meat like juicy marbles, etc - it just can't compete. Not in terms of taste, and not in terms of texture. There are some better ways of making and serving it - deep frying provides best results, IMO, just like with tempeh - but it's still not going to out-compete other meat replacements.

This is my subjective opinion, of course. But I don't think it's only me. I can make other vegan dishes that will make my carnivore friends and family say things like ""wow! If vegan food was always like this I wouldn't feel a need to eat meat!"" But I have never heard any of them say something like that about seitan. 

Now it's fine to eat seitan if one actually likes it, of course, or for the protein content. But I think we might do a disservice to the vegan cause if we serve it to non-vegans and claim that it can replace meat. 

Are there others who feel the same way, or is it only me?",t2_83ziwiz,"Rant/unpopular opinion: Seitan isn't that good, actually",0.71,243,1718451141.0,1718451141.0,209,Japsenpapsen,1dgfxrc

Normally for Christmas I bake a bunch of cookies, babysit all the children and teens for an afternoon and get them to help me decorate them, the youngest is now 10, so we‚Äôre quite the skilled group and it‚Äôs a fun activity for everyone. We generally get enough that all of them can have a few while we decorate, bring some home to give as gifts or to eat later and to have a nice little spread for Christmas Eve dinner. Plus it frees up their parents for an afternoon so they can shop for gifts or have a little peace. All good stuff, inspired a few years ago by American movies. 

This year one of the oldest kids (16) decided to try being vegan. Nobody in the family minded, as we‚Äôve worked out vegetarian options (the 16yo and their mom have been vegetarian for about 5years) and in most cases switching from vegetarian to vegan is not a huge problem, but I‚Äôm stumped!

veganrecipes,"Hello.



I need some recipes that are: 

\- Extremely easy to make

\- Cheap enough to convince my parents to buy the ingredients

\- Tasty



 My parents are Christian conservatives that freak out over the mention of anything even remotely progressive, so I don't wanna tell them i want to go vegan.



 I want to make my own meals but I have zero cooking experience and almost every single meal I have ever eaten had animal products in it, so going vegan will be a complete dietary 180 for me, not to mention that I hate vegetables. The only way that my grandma has ever managed to make me eat vegetables is by just throwing random veggies in the blender and making me eat the resulting slop, which was palatable enough for me to eat. The only vegetables I really like currently are corn and pumpkins. It'll take a while before i get an acquired taste for vegetables, and food without animal products in general.



Also due to the country I live in I'm having a hard time finding some ingredients that lots of vegan recipes use like tofu, fake meat, vegan versions of certain products, etc.

veganrecipes,"If you have a rice cooker, rinse your sushi rice until it runs clear and then put in a splash of rice wine vinegar, a tablespoon of sugar, and a little salt. Otherwise, stovetop is fine. You're going to want a short grained rice.

The filling I did today was five spears asparagus, a small sweet potato, and avocado. I cooked up the sweet potato matchsticks and asparagus in a skillet while my eel sauce was reducing.

Eel sauce: equal parts soy sauce, sugar, and mirin. Just simmer until thick. 1/4 cup of each will perfectly fit in a soy sauce dish and is probably enough for 2 or even 3 people.

Put down some aluminum foil in a baking tray and spread the prepared rice on it to quickly cool.

You can watch a quick YouTube video on how to roll them, but I'll explain anyway. You can get a cheap bamboo rolling mat if you make it a lot, but for years I just used a bit of plastic wrap. Put rice on most of the nori (shiny side down) leaving 1/2 inch plain on the end. Lay filling in a line down the middle. Roll the nori over the filling, then complete the roll and shape evenly with slight pressure. Use a large serrated knife to cut it in a gentle sawing motion. If you want to use a non serrated knife it needs to be really sharp. The thing to do is to lightly cut into the wrap a little before you add more pressure. It'll make sense when you do it.

Bonus: crunchy stuff is just panko toasted in vegan butter. You can do spicy mayo with just sriracha and vegan mayo, but go heavy on the sriracha. You can get wasabi and pickled ginger online if your store doesn't sell it.

For those who want to know, the sushi pictured was 800 calories and 17 grams of protein.

All this to say, once the rice is ready it'll take 5 to 10 minutes to prepare. I made 2 cups of rice for 3 rolls, but didn't use it all. Also, not pictured are all the end pieces I ate while I was making it.

Tonight, I wanted to make another type of seitan and went along and used again the steaming method. I did not see that the cork coaster was still attached to the top part of the steamer.
It was only after the whole proces that I noticed the cork coaster flosting in my pot of hot water...

Is my seitan still okay to eat?

veganrecipes,"Most of the time I'm a comically slow cook, if a recipe claims it takes 20 minutes to make, it'll probably take me at least an hour. But I mean it when I say these 3 recipes are actually really fast and low effort. I make these on those days when I'm so tired I can't bring myself to actually cook but a bowl of cereal or a PB&J isn't cutting it. 

Recipe #1- Pasta with chickpeas and red wine vinegar dressing: 
Step 1. Boil some pasta (I like Rotini) 
Step 2. In a bowl mix together some olive oil, red wine vinegar, and seasonings (I use Italian seasoning and garlic powder. I also like to add a bit of the pasta water)
Step 3. Drain and rinse a can of chickpeas and add to the pasta. Add the dressing and mix. Done. 

I hesitate to call this a pasta salad but that's kinda the idea. Fun fact I once made this with the leftover brine from a jar of olives instead of red wine vinegar and it turned out pretty alright. Not the most appetizing recipe I've ever made but when it's 10 o'clock at night and you're hungry af it does the job. 

Recipe #2 - Chickpea spinach scramble: 
Step 1. Drain and rinse a can of chickpeas and throw em in a pan with some olive oil over low heat.
Step 2. Mash the chickpeas with a fork. I leave some intact. Then season with salt, cumin, turmeric, garlic powder, and curry powder. Or whatever spices you prefer. 
Step 3. Turn heat up a little, add in a few handfuls of spinach and a generous splash of water and cover for a few minutes until spinach is wilted. Mix. Done! 

I've been having this for breakfast a lot this week. Very tasty and easy way to get protein in the morning.  The online recipe I learned this from suggested topping with avocado but I haven't tried that yet.

Recipe #3 - Chickpea salad sandwich 
Step 1. Drain and rinse a can of chickpeas and mash up to your desired consistency. 
Step 2. Mix in vegan mayo, lemon juice, little bit of minced garlic, red pepper flakes, salt, garlic powder, and Italian seasoning. 
Step 3: Put between two pieces of bread. Done! 

I don't think I've ever actually had a tuna salad sandwich but this gives me similar vibes. Also reminds me a bit of the chicken salad my mom used to make when I was a kid so this sandwich kinda tastes weirdly nostalgic to me.

veganrecipes,"Hey fellow vegan food lovers!

So, I did something a little crazy last week - I included chocolate cake in my meal prep. I know, I know, it sounds wild, but hear me out because it's been a game-changer for my easy vegan meal prep ideas!

**Why Cake for Meal Prep?**

1. Prevents impulse buys of vegan junk food
2. Built-in portion control
3. Major time saver
4. Instant mood booster (it's chocolate cake, duh!)

**The Recipe:** (This is so easy, it's almost embarrassing)

Ingredients:

* 1 1/2 cups all-purpose flour
* 1 cup granulated sugar
* 1/4 cup cocoa powder
* 1 tsp baking soda
* 1/2 tsp salt
* 1 cup water
* 1/3 cup vegetable oil
* 1 tbsp apple cider vinegar
* 1 tsp vanilla extract

Instructions:

1. Mix dry ingredients
2. Mix wet ingredients
3. Combine wet and dry
4. Pour into greased 8-inch pan
5. Bake at 350¬∞F for 30-35 minutes
6. Cool, then slice for meal prep

**Meal Prep Magic:**

* Slice into 9-12 pieces
* Wrap individually (I use reusable silicone bags)
* Refrigerate for 5 days or freeze for 3 months

**Keeping It Interesting:**

* Monday: Plain cake
* Tuesday: Add vegan whipped cream
* Wednesday: Sprinkle with berries
* Thursday: Drizzle with vegan chocolate sauce
* Friday: Crumble over vegan ice cream (because, Friday)

**The Results:** Guys, this has seriously upgraded my meal prep game. Having a sweet treat ready to go has:

1. Saved me from impulse-buying expensive vegan desserts
2. Helped me portion control (no more eating half a cake in one sitting... not that I've ever done that...)
3. Made my co-workers super jealous (always a plus, right?)

veganrecipes,"[Full recipe available here.](https://www.plantifulpalate.com/post/vegan-eggplant-parmesan)


Recipe:
Ingredients:
- For the eggplant:
  - 2 large eggplants, sliced into 1/2-inch rounds
  - 1 cup flour
  - 2 cups breadcrumbs
  - 1 cup plant-based milk (soy, almond, etc.)
  - 1 tsp garlic powder
  - 1 tsp onion powder
  - 1 tsp dried oregano
  - Salt and pepper, to taste
  - 1/4 cup vegetable oil for frying

- For the marinara sauce:
  - 2 cups marinara sauce
  - 1 tbsp olive oil
  - 3 cloves garlic, minced
  - 1 small onion, finely chopped
  - 1 tsp dried basil
  - 1 tsp dried oregano
  - Salt and pepper, to taste

- For assembly:
  - 8 slices vegan cheese (Applewood vegan cheese)
  - Fresh basil leaves, chopped

Method:
1. Preheat the oven to 180¬∞C (350¬∞F). Line a baking sheet with parchment paper.
2. Lay the eggplant slices on a baking sheet and sprinkle with salt. Let sit for 15 minutes to draw out excess moisture. Pat dry with a paper towel.
3. Prepare the breading station: place flour in one bowl, plant-based milk in another, and breadcrumbs mixed with garlic powder, onion powder, dried oregano, salt, and pepper in a third.
4. Dip each eggplant slice into the flour, then the plant-based milk, and finally coat with the seasoned breadcrumbs. Press gently to ensure the breadcrumbs adhere well.
5. Heat vegetable oil in a large skillet over medium heat. Fry the breaded eggplant slices until golden brown on both sides, about 2-3 minutes per side. Place fried eggplant on the prepared baking sheet.
6. In a saucepan, heat olive oil over medium heat. Saut√© garlic and onion until fragrant and translucent. Add marinara sauce, dried basil, dried oregano, salt, and pepper. Simmer for 10 minutes.
7. Spread a thin layer of marinara sauce on the bottom of a baking dish. Place a layer of fried eggplant slices over the sauce. Top each slice with a vegan cheese slice. Repeat the layers, ending with a layer of vegan cheese slices on top.
8. Cover the baking dish with foil to help melt the cheese and bake in the preheated oven for 20-25 minutes. Remove the foil for the last 5 minutes to allow the cheese to brown slightly.
9. For an extra melty finish, you can use the steam technique: place a small, heatproof bowl of boiling water in the oven alongside the baking dish. The steam will help melt the vegan cheese slices to perfection.
10. Garnish with fresh basil leaves before serving.

veganrecipes,"Hello, everyone!

I posted yesterday about wanting to make a vegan version of goat brain curry (maghaz masala or bheja fry) for my wife. I received many responses, mostly very helpful ones, and some asking for an update, others asking for a recipe. So here is the update.

Short version of the update: Silken tofu was a genius suggestion, thank you. It came out PERFECTLY with the consistency I was looking for.

Long version of the update: I don‚Äôt have a recipe to share for one main reason. About halfway through the cooking process a made a critical error and spent the rest of the time panicking and doing damage control. Let me explain. 

I started by dicing one medium-large onion. I then warmed up avocado oil (a lot of it). When it was warm, I threw in the onion, allowed it to simmer for a bit, then threw in some ginger-garlic paste (this is a staple in South Asian cooking, though I‚Äôm sure you can just throw in some ginger and garlic separately if you wanted). 

After the ginger-garlic paste and the onion cooked for a little more, this is where I made the critical mistake. I had a 15-ounce can of crushed tomato pur√©e. I don‚Äôt know why but I didn‚Äôt measure some out and see if it was enough, I just dumped the entire can into the pan like an absolute airhead. So now I‚Äôm standing there with a pan that just looks like tomato pur√©e, because even after mixing it, the tomato pur√©e was just covering everything.

In an effort to do damage control, I added water (don‚Äôt know how much), more oil (don‚Äôt know how much), and some sugar (don‚Äôt know how much). Luckily, somehow, after adding these things, it started to look like a curry again and not like just a pan of tomato pur√©e.

I then added salt, a little bit of crushed red pepper, Garam masala, and one of the Shan Brain Masala packets that come in a box from the Indian store (in this packet is cumin, black pepper, turmeric, salt, garlic powder, cinnamon, bay leaves, ginger, and aniseed). The last flavoring I added after that was some fenugreek leaves.

I let these spices cook in there for a bit and it started smelling absolutely delicious, and that was (I think) my first indication that I had taken control of the tomato pur√©e situation.

Then, finally, I pulled the silken tofu out of the container. Before yesterday, I had never heard of, let alone seen or cooked with, silken tofu before. Nevertheless, I drained the water, dabbed it lightly with a paper towel (this is what I do with my extra firm when cooking with it, except I don‚Äôt ‚Äúdab it lightly), and then tossed it into the curry. I used the wooden spoon to break it into some large chunks and then mixed those chunks around until some had dissolved into smaller pieces.

At this point, it had not only taken on the smell, but the look of goat brain curry. I was amazed and my mouth was watering. I‚Äôm not sure if anyone here is interested in a picture, but I you are, just let me know and I can Chat or Message you the pic.

The only thing left was to taste it. I made some naan and other South Asian breads for myself and my wife, we sat down for dinner, and the taste absolutely matched the flavor and consistency of goat brain. An entirely vegan dish and it was like I was a kid again at my grandma‚Äôs. My wife (to her surprise more than mine) actually loved it too, despite me calling it Vegan Brain Curry all night hahaha. 

She‚Äôs obviously never had goat brain curry, but she said the dish was delish and we had plenty of leftovers for tonight too. Thank you all so much again for the suggestions!!!

Most of the suggestions were bean/veggie based (not hating but I wanted something a little bit unhealthier). But one person shared a really awesome sounding recipe with some ingredients I needed to order. While I wait for those I decided to try my hand at a Tofu based sauce. I blended the heck out of some form tofu, added salt, jalapenos (and juice), nooch, tumeric, garlic and onion. It came out pretty good!! Its not exactly what I need but it scratched the itchy while I wait for those ingredients to come in. Anyway I wanted to share for anyone else craving those chemicals and plastic like me.

veganrecipes,"[Full recipe available here.](https://www.plantifulpalate.com/post/soy-glazed-vegan-cauliflower-wings)

Recipe:
Ingredients:

For the cauliflower wings:
  - 1 medium cauliflower, cut into florets
  - 1 cup plain flour
  - 1 cup water
  - 1 teaspoon garlic powder
  - 1 teaspoon smoked paprika
  - ¬Ω teaspoon salt
  - ¬Ω teaspoon black pepper
  - Oil, for frying

For the sweet and spicy soy glaze:
  - ¬Ω cup soy sauce (use a low-sodium variety if preferred)
  - ¬º cup maple syrup

Method:

1. In a large bowl, whisk together the flour, water, garlic powder, smoked paprika, salt, and black pepper until smooth. The batter should have a thick, pancake-like consistency that clings to the cauliflower florets. Adjust with more water or flour as needed.

2. Pour enough oil into a deep frying pan to cover the bottom by about an inch. Heat over medium-high heat until a small drop of batter sizzles upon contact.

3. Dip each cauliflower floret into the batter, ensuring it‚Äôs fully covered. Carefully place the coated florets into the hot oil, frying in batches to avoid overcrowding. Fry for about 5-7 minutes or until golden brown and crispy. Remove with a slotted spoon and drain on a paper towel to remove excess oil.

4. In a small saucepan, combine the soy sauce, maple syrup, sriracha, garlic, and ginger. Bring to a gentle simmer over medium heat, stirring occasionally. Once the mixture is heated through, add the cornflour mixture and stir continuously until the sauce thickens and becomes glossy, about 2 minutes.

5. Transfer the fried cauliflower wings into a large mixing bowl. Pour the hot glaze over the wings, tossing gently to coat each piece thoroughly with the sauce.

6. Serve immediately, garnished with sesame seeds and chopped spring onions for added crunch and flavour. These wings are best enjoyed hot, straight from the pan, while they retain their crispiness.

veganrecipes,"[Full recipe available here.](https://www.plantifulpalate.com/post/vegan-tofu-jalfrezi)

Ingredients:
- 400g firm tofu, drained and cubed
- 2 tbsp vegetable oil
- 1 large onion, thinly sliced
- 2 cloves garlic, minced
- 1-inch piece of ginger, grated
- 2 large tomatoes, pureed
- 1 red bell pepper, chopped
- 1 green bell pepper, chopped
- 2 green chilies, sliced
- 1 tsp cumin seeds
- 1 tsp ground coriander
- 1 tsp ground cumin
- 1 tsp turmeric powder
- 1 tsp garam masala
- Salt, to taste
- Fresh coriander, chopped (for garnish)

Method:
1. Begin by pressing the tofu to remove excess moisture. Wrap the tofu in a clean kitchen towel and place a heavy object on top for about 15 minutes. Once pressed, cut the tofu into bite-sized cubes and set them aside.

2. Heat the vegetable oil in a large pan over medium heat. Add the cumin seeds and wait for them to sizzle and pop, releasing their aromatic oils. This is your foundation of flavor.

3. Add the thinly sliced onions to the pan and saut√© them until they turn a deep golden brown. This caramelization process enhances the sweetness of the onions, balancing the heat of the spices. Next, stir in the minced garlic and grated ginger, cooking until fragrant‚Äîabout 2 minutes.

4. Pour in the pureed tomatoes, stirring them into the onion mixture. Cook this down until the oil begins to separate from the tomato base, creating a rich masala. This step is key to developing the deep, complex flavors that define a good jalfrezi.

5. Incorporate the ground coriander, ground cumin, turmeric, and garam masala into the tomato mixture. Cook the spices for 3-4 minutes, allowing them to bloom and infuse the masala with their warmth and depth.

6. Toss in the chopped red and green bell peppers along with the sliced green chilies. Stir everything together and let the peppers cook for 5-7 minutes. They should soften slightly but retain a bit of crunch, adding texture to the dish.

7. Gently fold in the tofu cubes, ensuring they are evenly coated with the spiced masala. Allow the tofu to simmer in the sauce for about 5 minutes, soaking up all the wonderful flavors.

8. Adjust the seasoning with salt to taste. Garnish generously with freshly chopped coriander before serving.

veganrecipes,"[Full recipe available here.](https://www.plantifulpalate.com/post/vegan-ravioli)


Ingredients:

For the Ravioli Dough:

- 300g all-purpose flour
- 100g semolina flour
- 1 tsp salt
- 200ml warm water
- 2 tbsp olive oil

For the Ravioli Filling:

- 200g firm tofu, crumbled
- 2 tbsp nutritional yeast
- 1 clove garlic, minced
- 1 tbsp lemon juice
- Salt and black pepper, to taste

For the Roasted Red Pepper Sauce:

- 3 large red bell peppers
- 2 tbsp olive oil
- 1 medium onion, finely chopped
- 3 cloves garlic, minced
- 200ml vegan cream cheese
- 1 tbsp nutritional yeast
- 1 tsp smoked paprika
- 1 tsp dried oregano
- Salt and freshly ground black pepper, to taste
- 1 tsp lemon juice

For Garnish:

- Fresh basil leaves, chopped

Method:

1. Preheat your oven to 200¬∞C. Cut the red bell peppers in half and remove the seeds and membranes. Place them on a baking tray lined with parchment paper, cut side down. Roast for 20-25 minutes, or until the skin is charred and blistered. Once roasted, place the peppers in a bowl and cover with cling film for 10 minutes to steam. Peel off the skin and set the roasted peppers aside.

2. In a large frying pan, heat 1 tablespoon of olive oil over medium heat. Add the chopped onion and saut√© for 5-6 minutes until softened and translucent. Stir in the minced garlic and cook for another 1-2 minutes until fragrant.

3. Add the roasted red peppers to a blender, along with the saut√©ed onion and garlic. Spoon in the vegan cream cheese, nutritional yeast, smoked paprika, and dried oregano. Blend until the mixture is smooth and creamy. Season with salt, black pepper, and lemon juice to taste.

4. To make the ravioli dough, combine the all-purpose flour, semolina flour, and salt in a large bowl. Make a well in the centre and add the warm water and olive oil. Mix until a dough forms, then knead on a floured surface for 8-10 minutes until smooth and elastic. Wrap in cling film and let it rest for 20 minutes.

5. While the dough is resting, prepare the filling. In a medium bowl, combine the crumbled tofu, nutritional yeast, minced garlic, lemon juice, salt, and black pepper. Mix well until evenly combined.

6. Once the dough has rested, divide it into two equal portions. Roll each portion out on a floured surface until it is very thin (about 2mm thick). Place small spoonfuls of the filling, about 4cm apart, on one sheet of the rolled dough. Place the second sheet of dough over the top, pressing around each mound of filling to seal. Use a knife or ravioli cutter to cut out individual ravioli pieces, ensuring the edges are sealed well.

7. Bring a large pot of salted water to a boil. Cook the ravioli in batches for 3-4 minutes, or until they float to the surface. Drain and set aside.

8. Pour the blended roasted red pepper sauce back into the frying pan and warm it over low heat. Add the cooked ravioli to the sauce, gently tossing to coat each piece in the creamy sauce.

9. Divide the creamy ravioli between four bowls. Garnish with chopped fresh basil leaves for a burst of colour and flavour.

veganrecipes,"So just freestyled this one up today. Was really good so thought I'd share. I didn't really think about the measurements when I was making it but this is roughly it:

- 2- 3 cloves garlic, or as many as you want really
- 1 teaspoon paprika 
- 1 teaspoon tumeric
- Pinch of thyme
- Sprinkle of chilli powder, flakes, or cayenne pepper, whatever you have on hand
- Salt to taste
- Pepper to taste 
- 2 tablespoons of nutritional yeast
- Olive oil (or you could use a vegan butter replacement)
- 200g tofu
- 2 medium onions 
- Water 


Cook everything (except water) together in a pan until onions are nice and soft. Add a little bit of water when the mix starts to get a bit dry. You want everything to maintain a bit of moisture. 

Once onions are soft you can take everything out and put it in a bowl or something large enough, add a quarter cup of water then blend thoroughly until as smooth as possible. I used a hand blender for a good 1 to 2 minutes.

Cook pasta of choice then mix so that it's generously covered like in the photos. 

Sprinkle a little bit of extra salt, pepper, chili flakes, nutritional yeast etc on top to taste.

veganrecipes,"I‚Äôve been seeing a lot of ‚Äúquick‚Äù caramel recipes around, and have seen even more lately while on a quest to make canned sweetened condensed milk caramel from sweetened condensed oconut milk (eagle brand milk pie, come back to me! üò≠). 

I frankly have never been impressed by quick caramel recipes. If ever I want something caramel-y but don‚Äôt have time for the real McCoy, I make butterscotch (which is way simpler than it seems and only takes like 10-15minutes). Otherwise, I‚Äôm a total freak for caramel and very purest about it. Real caramel is worth the time, effort, and equipment. 

So in that spirit, here‚Äôs my caramel sauce recipe I make each week at my vegan donut shop. It makes about 3.5qts, which for home or commercial use, is just barely enough üôÉ but if you just need a little, feel free to divide. This recipe takes about 2 hours, most of it inactive. 

EQUIPMENT- 
-a heavy bottom sauce pot, mine is about 5qts
- a big ass soup pot if you‚Äôre planning to make this full recipe (will explain why later)
- a remote probe thermometer with an alarm function

INGREDIENTS-
- 2000g refined white sugar (if it isn‚Äôt refined and white, it will not work. It will burn. Most domino sugar is bone char free these days!)
- 1/2C corn syrup (you will risk grainy caramel without it)
-hot water
- (3) 13.66fl oz cans of unsweetened coconut milk (the fewer the ingredients the better, and make sure the first ingredient is coconut)
- 2 Tbsp salt
- 2 Tbsp vanilla
- 1lb of your favorite vegan butter (Violife is my pick! STAY AWAY FROM EARTH BALANCE- bad flavors happen when it gets this hot)

Start with your sugar and corn syrup in the sauce pot. Add enough hot water to cover and gently stir to get everything wet. Get your probe thermometer set to go off at 340F, stick it in there, and cook on medium-high heat until the alarm sounds. This will take about an hour. Leave it alone, but don‚Äôt go far. 

While it‚Äôs cooking, get your coconut milk cans open and make sure they‚Äôre all liquified. 

At this point, it isn‚Äôt caramel yet. Remove the probe and watch. Within about 5ish minutes it will darken before your eyes. You‚Äôre going for a rich amber color. One blog 100years ago said the color of Bass Amber Ale and I agree! This part gets easier the more you do it, and I have not found one exact temp for when it‚Äôs done caramelizing. 

Okay so here‚Äôs the soup pot part- my saucepan cannot contain all that sugar and milk without boiling over, so I dump the coconut milk and caramel into my trusty big ass soup pot instead. Problem solved!

If you are making a smaller amount, you can add the coconut milk to the pot of caramel. It will bubble and hiss and be dramatic. Maybe do this in your sink if you‚Äôre unsure that your pot is big enough. In either case, stir it vigorously until all the milk is combined into the caramel. 

Add the salt, set the probe to 235F, cook on medium-high and wait for the alarm. 

Once at 235F, remove from heat and add vanilla and butter. Stir until it‚Äôs all combined and let cool on the counter. You‚Äôre going to want to stir it every so often to keep the oils of the coconut and butter from separating before you refrigerate. 

Would you rather have caramel candies instead of sauce? No problemo, just cook the mixture to 240 instead of 235 (or even hotter, if you want it chewier). 

And that‚Äôs it! Caramel often comes across as high maintenance and just plain hard, but this recipe never lets me down.

Ingredients:
* 400g macaroni pasta
* 2 cups unsweetened almond milk (or any plant-based milk)
* 1 cup vegan cheese, shredded
* 1/2 cup nutritional yeast (for added ""cheesy"" flavour)
* 2 tbsp vegan butter
* 2 tbsp all-purpose flour (to make the roux)
* 1 tsp garlic powder (for extra depth of flavour)
* 1 tsp onion powder
* 1/2 tsp smoked paprika (plus extra for garnish)
* Salt and pepper, to taste
* Fresh parsley, chopped (for garnish)

Method:
1. Bring a large pot of salted water to a boil and cook the macaroni until it‚Äôs al dente, according to the package instructions. Drain and set aside.
2. In a large saucepan, melt the vegan butter over medium heat. Whisk in the flour to create a roux and cook for about 2 minutes, ensuring it doesn‚Äôt brown. This forms the base of the creamy cheese sauce.
3. Gradually whisk in the almond milk, stirring constantly to prevent lumps. Continue cooking until the mixture thickens slightly, around 3-4 minutes.
4. Add the shredded vegan cheddar, nutritional yeast, garlic powder, onion powder, smoked paprika, and a pinch of salt and pepper. Stir continuously until the cheese has melted and the sauce is smooth and creamy. If the sauce appears too thick, you can add a little more almond milk to reach your desired consistency.
5. Stir in the cooked macaroni, ensuring every piece is well coated with the luscious vegan cheese sauce.
6. Transfer to a serving dish and sprinkle extra smoked paprika on top for a touch of colour and heat. Garnish with fresh parsley for a pop of green and serve hot.

veganrecipes,"I've been meaning to write this for a while, I see a lot of recipes on here which are great but don't directly address the real bedrock of good plant-based cooking which is technique. Most of what I'm going to say might already be known and aren't specifically plant-based techniques, just techniques which are good to squeeze a lot of flavour out. Please feel free to ignore the ones you already know!

**The Magic Ingredient is Time**

You can make the best tomato sauce you've ever eaten with just garlic, onion, tomatoes, black pepper, salt and oil, as long as you have one extra secret ingredient: **Time**. Start early and leaving it cooking on a low heat. This develops natural sugars into deep, savoury flavours. Lots of recipes for tomato sauces include sugar or synthetic MSG in some capacity. These are fine, but they're only substitutes for time, because sweetness and umami come naturally with a slow cook. This counts double for oven roasting as there are more places getting direct heat - that dark brown stuff around the edge of your pot after roasting a sauce in the oven is pure flavour. 

If you want to add vegetables which retain texture, simply let the base sauce cook for a couple of hours and add them in at the end. Everybody wins!

**Professional Chefs Hate This One Weird Trick**

You aren't using enough salt. And you probably aren't using enough oil either. When you have amazing vegan food in restaurants, there's a very strong chance you're eating a *lot* of salt and oil. Oil holds the flavour and adds richness, salt makes it moreish and powerful. I understand a lot of people who eat plant-based diets are also very health conscious, and all power to you, your dietary decisions are your own. But if you're entertaining (or, to address a frequent question, cooking for non-vegans) then you want to pack a punch and that starts with things which aren't healthy.

**Umami**

This flavour profile is very common in meat-based dishes, replacing it is a very well known practice in vegan cookery, and probably the one most widely known (judging from the type of stuff that gets posted). People are well acquainted with miso, MSG, soy sauce, gochujang etc. One free way to get it without any additives however (which might compromise an 'authentic' flavour you're going for) is to just brown everything you can. Fry your onions low and slow until they caramelise. Roast your vegetables hard before stirring them through. Salt your veg when you're frying it so that it releases its liquid quicker and browns more. Don't ever rush through the frying portion of your sauce - this is where you build the basis of the flavour for the whole dish. If you have to spent 30 minutes slowly adding vegetables, not crowding the pan, salting a bit at a time, adding tomato pur√©e to fry that off to a dark colour as well...do it. It will be worth it. You should also be thinking about infusing spices into the oil at this stage, this is a good time to add fresh black pepper or chilli flakes, you can also roast whole garlic in the oil and then dice it up to re-add later. 

**Learn National Cuisines**

The caveat to this is that not everyone has access to every ingredient and a lot of cooking is make-do. Allowing for that, however: be culturally omnivorous. There are more delicious vegan dishes from the Indian subcontinent than you can cook in a lifetime. I understand the impulse to try and veganise things which are familiar but you'll probably get better results with something which is the result of long cultural practice and the holistic use of plant-based ingredients at every stage. The single best thing you can do for your kitchen is a huge spice cupboard - and whole spices where you can, because toasting and grinding them gets the best flavour. 

**Stop Using Garlic Powder**

Okay, ""clickbait"" heading aside, there are lots of great uses for garlic powder. Fresh garlic burns and goes bitter very easily, so dishes where you're exposing the ingredient to a lot of heat it makes sense to use garlic powder, in situations such as rubs for a deep fry. You might also be making a raw dressing or salad and want the milder, more toasted flavour. Most of the time though, if you're making a sauce in a pan, if you have access to fresh garlic you will get much better results from using it. Again, if it's a time-saving or accessibility issue for you then you must do what is easiest for you, but if you want to try and cook high quality, restaurant-standard dishes, then it's time for fresh garlic. 

**Finish your pasta in the pan**

Nice quick one - add your mostly-cooked pasta to the pan with the sauce, add in a little bit of the pasta water and some vegan butter if you're feeling luxurious, stir it through and keep moving and tossing it so that the sauce emulsifies into a rich, silky one. I see a lot of meals with a somewhat gummy-looking sauce poured over dry pasta in the bowl. This won't be as tasty. The addition of the starchy, salted pasta water can also let down a sauce which is too stiff. Likewise if the sauce is too thin, the pasta will soak it up and you can can skip the pasta water. It's a great tool. 

**Sweet, Acid and Heat**

These are the flavour profiles which aren't always natural additions but do a *lot* of work in improving the flavour of a dish. A dash of lemon juice, a spoonful of pomegranate molasses or a handful of chilli flakes (or all three) can transform a plate of food. Acid is the most obvious one of this - cook something like a chilli without any sharp ingredients and then add lime juice at the end and it's almost unbelievable how much it springs into life at times.

veganrecipes,"I was going to make a mushroom stew with just portobellos but HeB had trumpets and lions mane and oysters, too! Now a simple stew costs over fifty dollars.

Worth it.

So, I rough chopped all those tasty mushrooms and placed them on both a parchment lined baking sheet, and some in my stockpot, with absolutely nothing. No oil. No salt. Nothing. 

Bake at 400 degrees stirring once or twice halfway until the water in the crockpot mushrooms are turning into fond. Then put them all in the stockpot, as they should have cooked down enough to fit.

Then, I put two shallots, a diced sweet pepper, and a single potato in there and baked for about ten minutes uncovered.

While those baked, I made my ‚Äúcurry‚Äù equivalent. Normally, I‚Äôd just use two to four tablespoons of premade ‚Äúcurry powder‚Äù but I‚Äôm out so I faked it with all those spices (turmeric, ginger, mustard, coriander, allspice, clove, cardamom, nutmeg). Add 2 tablespoons of dried thyme, 1 tablespoon of caraway seeds, and 1/2 cup of salt and pepper. 

Nana is making kale chips later so I diced up the stalks of two two bunches of kale and a good bit of leftover Chinese cabbage. 

Added all this to the pot, with two cans of garbanzo beans in their liquid, one can of organic full fat coconut milk, 2 tablespoons of coconut oil, one can of tomato paste, about four tablespoons of soy sauce, and let it bake uncovered for ten minutes still at 400.

Perfect for mashing, frying, or roasting. Then add to any dish- burritos, pizza, salads, scrambles, everything!

Instant Pot Potatoes 
Cube your potatoes (I used russet), and cook for 3 minutes on high pressure with a 3-6 minute natural release. (Using less time if you want to keep any firmness in them)

They are the fluffiest thing ever. You can barely get them out without them crumbling apart but once you get into hot oil they will hold. Or you can just smush them with a spoon into perfect mashed potatoes.

Ingredients:

	‚Ä¢	400g firm tofu, cut into cubes
	‚Ä¢	2 tbsp vegetable oil
	‚Ä¢	1 large onion, sliced
	‚Ä¢	3 cloves garlic, minced
	‚Ä¢	1 tbsp grated ginger
	‚Ä¢	3 tbsp green curry paste
	‚Ä¢	1 tsp ground coriander
	‚Ä¢	400ml canned coconut milk
	‚Ä¢	200ml vegetable stock
	‚Ä¢	1 tbsp soy sauce
	‚Ä¢	1 tbsp maple syrup
	‚Ä¢	1 red bell pepper, sliced
	‚Ä¢	150g sugar snap peas
	‚Ä¢	3-4 green chillies (optional, for extra heat)
	‚Ä¢	Juice of 1 lime
	‚Ä¢	Salt and freshly ground black pepper
	‚Ä¢	300g jasmine rice, cooked according to package instructions

Method:

	1.	To prepare the tofu, drain it well and press it to remove excess moisture. Place the tofu block on a clean kitchen towel or several layers of paper towels, wrap it, and place a flat plate or cutting board on top. Add something heavy, like a few cans or a skillet, to press the tofu for about 15 minutes. Once pressed, cut the tofu into cubes.
	2.	In a large frying pan, heat 1 tablespoon of vegetable oil over medium heat. Add the tofu cubes and fry for 5-7 minutes, turning occasionally, until all sides are golden. Remove from the pan and set aside.
	3.	In a large saucepan, heat the remaining tablespoon of vegetable oil over medium heat. Add the sliced onion and saut√© for 4-5 minutes until softened. Stir in the minced garlic and grated ginger, cooking for another 1-2 minutes until fragrant.
	4.	Add the green curry paste and ground coriander, stirring well to coat the onion mixture. Let it cook for 1-2 minutes to release the full aroma of the spices.
	5.	Pour in the coconut milk and vegetable stock, stirring until well combined. Add the soy sauce and maple syrup, and bring the mixture to a gentle simmer. Let it cook for about 5 minutes to allow the flavours to meld together.
	6.	Add the sliced red bell pepper, sugar snap peas, and green chillies to the curry. Let them cook for 5-7 minutes until the vegetables are tender but still crisp.
	7.	Gently stir in the fried tofu cubes, ensuring they are coated in the rich, creamy broth. Squeeze in the lime juice, and season with salt and freshly ground black pepper to taste.
	8.	To serve, spoon the jasmine rice onto plates or into bowls, and ladle the green curry over the top. Serve with extra lime wedges for those who enjoy a bit more tanginess.

Recipe:
Ingredients:
- For the tofu steaks:
  - 400g firm tofu
  - 3 tbsp soy sauce
  - 2 tbsp olive oil
  - 1 tbsp maple syrup
  - 1 tbsp lemon juice
  - 2 cloves garlic, minced
  - 1 tsp smoked paprika
  - Salt and black pepper, to taste
  - Fresh chives, chopped, for garnish

- For the asparagus:
  - 1 bunch asparagus, trimmed
  - 2 tbsp olive oil
  - 1 tbsp lemon juice
  - Salt and black pepper, to taste

Method:
1. Press the tofu by wrapping it in a clean kitchen towel and placing it on a plate. Put a heavy object, like a cast-iron skillet or a few cookbooks, on top. Press for at least 15 minutes to remove excess water. This step ensures that the tofu absorbs the marinade better.
2. Slice the pressed tofu into thick steaks, about 2cm thick.
3. In a bowl, whisk together the soy sauce, olive oil, maple syrup, lemon juice, minced garlic, smoked paprika, salt, and black pepper to create the marinade.
4. Place the tofu steaks in a shallow dish or a resealable plastic bag. Pour the marinade over the tofu, ensuring each piece is well-coated. For the best flavour, marinate the tofu for at least 30 minutes, but preferably overnight in the refrigerator. If marinating overnight, turn the tofu occasionally to ensure even absorption.
5. Preheat a grill or grill pan over medium heat. Brush the grill with a bit of oil to prevent sticking.
6. Grill the tofu steaks for about 5-7 minutes on each side, basting with the remaining marinade until they have charred grill marks and are heated through. The caramelisation of the marinade adds depth to the flavour.
7. Toss the asparagus with olive oil, lemon juice, salt, and black pepper. Grill the asparagus for 3-4 minutes, turning occasionally, until tender and slightly charred.
8. Arrange the grilled tofu steaks and asparagus on plates. Garnish with chopped chives and serve with lemon wedges.

Preheat the oven to 400 degrees

  
In a large bowl combine: 

2 tsp bouillon paste (such as Better Than Bouillon No Chicken Base) 

1/2 tsp pepper

1/2 tsp garlic powder

1/2 tsp sugar 

2 tablespoons extra virgin olive oil

  
Then add your tofu to the mix in whatever form you like (cubes, slabs, hand-torn pieces. You can press it if you really want to but I didn't and it was fine). Mix to coat the tofu. As the moisture of the tofu mixes with the marinade, it will become smoother and coat the tofu evenly. Let it marinate for at least 15 minutes. 

  
Sprinkle a tablespoon or two of cornstarch (or whatever starch you prefer) and mix it up. 

  
Bake it on parchment or a lightly greased pan for 30-40 minutes or until it's as browned as you like it.

Anyway, as delicious as this burger recipe is I messed up when making them and my burgers are falling apart. Originally I was planning on freezing the extras to eat at a later date when I dont feel like making something. 

But since they're falling apart I wasn't sure if freezing them would be a good idea.

veganrecipes,"[Full recipe available here.](https://www.plantifulpalate.com/post/korean-style-spicy-sticky-vegan-tofu)

Recipe:
Ingredients:
- 400g firm tofu, pressed and cubed
- 2 cups jasmine rice
- 1 tablespoon sesame oil
- 2 cloves garlic, finely minced
- 1 tablespoon freshly grated ginger
- 3 tablespoons soy sauce
- 2 tablespoons maple syrup
- 1 tablespoon gochujang (Korean chili paste)
- 1 tablespoon rice vinegar
- Spring onions, thinly sliced, for garnish
- Sesame seeds, toasted, for garnish

Method:
1. Begin by preparing the tofu. Wrap the tofu block in a clean kitchen towel and set a heavy object on top for 15-20 minutes to expel excess moisture. After pressing, cut the tofu into 1-inch cubes for even cooking.
2. Cook the jasmine rice as per the package instructions until each grain is separate and tender. Fluff with a fork once done and cover to retain warmth.
3. In a non-stick skillet, warm the sesame oil over medium flame. Once hot, add the tofu cubes. Saut√©, turning occasionally, until all sides are golden and crispy, approximately 8-10 minutes.
4. As the tofu cooks, prepare the sticky sauce. In a small mixing bowl, combine the minced garlic, grated ginger, soy sauce, maple syrup, gochujang, and rice vinegar. Stir until well mixed.
5. Once the tofu is cooked, reduce the skillet's heat to low. Carefully pour the sauce mixture over the crispy tofu. Let it simmer gently, frequently stirring, until the sauce thickens and adheres to the tofu, creating a glossy coating (about 5 minutes).
6. To serve, spoon the fluffy jasmine rice into bowls. Top with a generous helping of the spicy sticky tofu. Garnish with a sprinkle of sliced spring onions and toasted sesame seeds to enhance flavor and texture.",t2_2t7zs0u,Korean Style Sticky Spicy Tofu,0.97,175,1704927973.0,1704927973.0,12,Whiterabbit2000,193m4kn

Recipe

Ingredients:
- 200g pasta (penne or your choice)
- Zest and juice of 1 large lemon
- 2 tablespoons extra virgin olive oil
- 1/2 teaspoon freshly cracked black pepper
- 1 teaspoon sea salt, more to taste
- 3 cloves garlic, finely minced
- A handful of fresh parsley, chopped
- 50g cashew nuts, soaked in hot water for 15 minutes
- 2 tablespoons vegan butter
- 1/2 teaspoon turmeric powder
- Vegan Parmesan cheese, grated (optional for serving)
- Red pepper Salt, for garnish (optional)

Method:
1. Begin by cooking your pasta in a large pot of boiling salted water until al dente, following the packet's instructions. Save a cup of pasta water for later, then drain the pasta.
2. In a blender, combine the soaked cashew nuts (drained), lemon zest, lemon juice, 1 clove of minced garlic, turmeric, and a splash of the reserved pasta water. Blend until smooth to create a rich, creamy sauce.
3. Heat the vegan butter in a large pan over medium heat. Saut√© the remaining garlic until it's just golden, then pour in the creamy cashew mixture, stirring well.
4. Add the cooked pasta to the sauce, tossing to ensure each strand is beautifully coated. If the sauce is too thick, loosen it with the additional pasta water until it reaches a silky consistency.
5. Stir in the cracked black pepper, salt to taste, and half of the chopped parsley.
6. Serve the pasta garnished with the remaining parsley, a sprinkle of vegan Parmesan, and a dash of red pepper Salt if desired.

Recipe:

Ingredients:
- 400g silken tofu
- 1 cup cherry tomatoes, halved
- 1/2 red onion, finely chopped
- 2 tbsp fresh parsley, chopped
- 2 tbsp fresh basil, chopped
- 1 tbsp fresh oregano, chopped
- 1/4 cup extra virgin olive oil
- 2 tbsp lemon juice
- 1 tbsp balsamic vinegar
- 1 clove garlic, minced
- 1 tsp dried oregano
- Salt and black pepper, to taste

Method:

1. Carefully drain the silken tofu and cut it into thick slices or cubes, depending on your preference. Arrange the tofu on a serving dish.

2. In a small bowl, whisk together the olive oil, lemon juice, balsamic vinegar, minced garlic, dried oregano, salt, and black pepper to create the marinade.

3. Pour the marinade evenly over the tofu, ensuring all pieces are well coated. Let it marinate in the refrigerator for at least 1 hour to allow the flavours to meld.

4. While the tofu is marinating, prepare the topping. In a mixing bowl, combine the cherry tomatoes, finely chopped red onion, fresh parsley, basil, and oregano. Toss gently to mix.

5. Once the tofu has marinated, remove it from the refrigerator. Spoon the tomato and herb mixture over the tofu, spreading it evenly.

6. Drizzle a bit more olive oil over the top and add an extra sprinkle of salt and black pepper if desired.

7. Serve the marinated silken tofu immediately, or let it sit for a few more minutes to absorb more flavour. Enjoy it as a light main course or as a refreshing appetiser.

veganrecipes,"[Full recipe available here.](https://www.plantifulpalate.com/post/vegan-red-thai-curry-noodle-soup)

Ingredients:  
- 400g firm tofu, cut into cubes  
- 2 tbsp vegetable oil  
- 1 large onion, finely sliced  
- 3 cloves garlic, minced  
- 1 tbsp grated ginger  
- 2 tbsp red curry paste (ensure vegan)  
- 1 tsp smoked paprika  
- 400ml canned coconut milk  
- 500ml vegetable stock  
- 1 tbsp soy sauce  
- 1 tbsp maple syrup  
- 200g rice noodles  
- 100g kale or spinach leaves  
- Juice of 1 lime  
- Salt and freshly ground black pepper, to taste  
- Fresh coriander leaves, for garnish

Method:

1. To prepare the tofu, drain it well and press it to remove excess moisture. Place the tofu block on a clean kitchen towel or several layers of paper towels, wrap it, and place a flat plate or cutting board on top. Add something heavy, like a few cans or a skillet, to press the tofu for about 15 minutes. Once pressed, cut the tofu into cubes.

2. In a large frying pan, heat 1 tablespoon of vegetable oil over medium heat. Add the tofu cubes and fry over medium-high heat for 5-7 minutes, turning occasionally, until all sides are golden and crispy. Remove from the pan and set aside.

3. In a large saucepan, heat the remaining tablespoon of vegetable oil over medium heat. Add the sliced onion and saut√© for 4-5 minutes until softened and translucent. Stir in the minced garlic and grated ginger, cooking for another 1-2 minutes until aromatic.

4. Add the red curry paste and smoked paprika, stirring well to coat the onion mixture. Let it cook for 1-2 minutes to release the full aroma of the spices.

5. Pour in the coconut milk and vegetable stock, stirring until well combined. Add the soy sauce and maple syrup, and bring the mixture to a gentle simmer. Let it cook for about 10 minutes to allow the flavours to meld beautifully.

6. While the broth is simmering, cook the rice noodles according to the package instructions. Drain and rinse with cold water to stop the cooking process, then set aside.

7. Add the kale or spinach leaves to the soup, allowing them to wilt for about 2-3 minutes. Gently stir in the crispy tofu cubes, ensuring they are coated in the rich, creamy broth. Squeeze in the lime juice, and season with salt and freshly ground black pepper to taste.

8. To serve, divide the cooked rice noodles between bowls and ladle the red curry broth over the noodles. Top with crispy tofu and wilted greens, and garnish with fresh coriander leaves for an extra burst of freshness.

Definitely one of my favourite recipes!
Ingredients:

For the Stir-Fry:

- 400g seitan, cut into bite-sized pieces
- 2 tbsp cornflour (cornstarch)
- 4 tbsp vegetable oil (for frying)
- 1 large onion, thinly sliced
- 1 green bell pepper, thinly sliced
- 3 cloves garlic, minced
- 2 tsp grated fresh ginger

For the Sauce:

- 150ml soy sauce
- 100g brown sugar
- 200ml water
- 1 tbsp rice vinegar
- 1 tbsp hoisin sauce
- 1 tsp chilli flakes (optional)
- 1 tbsp cornflour, mixed with 2 tbsp water

For the Spinach:

- 400g fresh spinach
- 1 tbsp olive oil
- 1 clove garlic, minced
- Salt and black pepper, to taste

To Serve:

- 300g jasmine rice

Method:

1. Place the seitan pieces in a bowl and sprinkle with cornflour, tossing until evenly coated. In a large frying pan or wok, heat 3 tablespoons of vegetable oil over medium-high heat. Add the seitan in batches and fry until golden and crispy, about 5-7 minutes. Remove from the pan and set aside on a plate lined with kitchen paper to drain excess oil.

2. In the same pan, heat the remaining tablespoon of vegetable oil. Add the sliced onion and bell pepper, saut√©ing for 5-6 minutes until they start to soften. Stir in the minced garlic and grated ginger, cooking for another 1-2 minutes until fragrant.

3. In a small bowl, mix together the soy sauce, brown sugar, water, rice vinegar, hoisin sauce, and chilli flakes (if using). Pour the sauce mixture into the pan with the vegetables and bring to a simmer. Let it cook for 3-4 minutes, allowing the sauce to thicken slightly.

4. Stir in the cornflour slurry (cornflour mixed with water) and continue cooking for another 1-2 minutes until the sauce thickens to a glossy consistency. Add the fried seitan back into the pan, tossing to coat them evenly in the sauce.

5. For the spinach, heat the olive oil in a separate pan over medium heat. Add the minced garlic and saut√© for 30 seconds until fragrant. Add the spinach and cook for 2-3 minutes until wilted. Season with salt and black pepper to taste.

6. For the rice, rinse the jasmine rice under cold water until the water runs clear. In a medium saucepan, combine the rice with 600ml of water and a pinch of salt. Bring to a boil over medium heat, then reduce to low heat, cover, and simmer for 15 minutes, or until all the water is absorbed. Remove from heat and let it sit, covered, for 5 minutes. Fluff the rice with a fork before serving.

7. To serve, divide the cooked jasmine rice between four plates. Top with the Mongolian seitan stir-fry and a generous portion of saut√©ed spinach. Enjoy!",t2_2t7zs0u,"Vegan Mongolian ""Beef"" (Seitan)",0.99,379,1732977324.0,1732977324.0,9,Whiterabbit2000,1h3dtpq

My twist on an Indian classic, usually called Chilli Paneer, using tofu instead, it's a must try!


Recipe:
Ingredients:
- 400g firm tofu, pressed and cubed
- 1 tablespoon cornflour
- 2 tablespoons vegetable oil
- 1 red bell pepper, chopped
- 1 green bell pepper, chopped
- 1 yellow bell pepper, chopped
- 1 large onion, diced
- 3 cloves garlic, minced
- 1-inch ginger, grated
- 2 green chillies, finely sliced
- 1 teaspoon cumin seeds
- 1 teaspoon coriander powder
- 1/2 teaspoon turmeric powder
- 1 teaspoon garam masala
- 2 tablespoons tomato pur√©e
- 1 teaspoon soy sauce
- 1 tablespoon vinegar
- Salt to taste
- Fresh coriander, chopped, for garnish
- Cooked basmati rice, to serve

Method:
1. Toss the tofu cubes in cornflour until evenly coated. This helps in creating a crispy exterior that will hold the spices well.
2. Heat oil in a pan over medium flame. Fry the tofu until golden on all sides, then set aside on a paper towel.
3. In the same pan, add the cumin seeds until they sputter. Saut√© the onions, garlic, ginger, and green chillies until the onions are translucent.
4. Stir in the bell peppers, and cook until slightly softened but still retaining some crunch.
5. Sprinkle in the coriander, turmeric, and garam masala. Stir well to coat the vegetables in the spices.
6. Add the tomato pur√©e, soy sauce, and vinegar to bring a tangy depth to the sauce.
7. Return the tofu to the pan, mixing gently to ensure each piece is enveloped in the sauce. Cook for a further 5 minutes.
8. Taste and season with salt. The key is to balance the heat, acidity, and salt to ensure the tofu is flavourful.",t2_2t7zs0u,Indian Style Vegan Chilli Tofu,0.99,142,1703701122.0,1703701122.0,9,Whiterabbit2000,18s77qd

veganrecipes,"[Full recipe available here.](https://www.plantifulpalate.com/post/korean-style-fried-vegan-dumplings)


Recipe:
Ingredients:
- For the dumplings:
  - 200g firm tofu, pressed and crumbled
  - 1 cup napa cabbage, finely shredded
  - 1/2 cup carrots, grated
  - 1/2 cup shiitake mushrooms, chopped
  - 2 spring onions, finely sliced
  - 3 cloves garlic, minced
  - 1-inch piece of ginger, grated
  - 2 tbsp soy sauce (or tamari for gluten-free)
  - 1 tbsp sesame oil
  - 1 tbsp gochujang (Korean red chilli paste)
  - 1 tbsp cornflour
  - 30 round dumpling wrappers (check they are vegan)
  - Vegetable oil for deep frying

- For the dipping sauce:
  - 4 tbsp soy sauce (or tamari for gluten-free)
  - 1 tbsp rice vinegar
  - 1 tbsp sesame oil
  - 1 tsp gochugaru (Korean chilli flakes)
  - 1 tbsp toasted sesame seeds

- Garnishes:
  - Fresh coriander, chopped
  - Red chilli, thinly sliced
  - Sesame seeds

Method:

1. Start by preparing the dumpling filling. In a large mixing bowl, combine the crumbled tofu, shredded napa cabbage, grated carrots, chopped shiitake mushrooms, spring onions, minced garlic, grated ginger, soy sauce, sesame oil, gochujang, and cornflour. Mix thoroughly until all ingredients are well combined and evenly distributed, ensuring the flavours meld together.

2. Set up a dumpling assembly station. Lay out one dumpling wrapper on a flat surface and spoon a small amount of the filling into the centre, taking care not to overfill. Wet the edges of the wrapper with water using your fingertip, fold it over to create a half-moon shape, and press firmly to seal the edges, making sure there are no air pockets. For an added touch, pleat the edges to achieve a traditional look. Repeat this process for all the wrappers and filling.

3. Heat a deep frying pan or wok with enough vegetable oil to submerge the dumplings, aiming for an oil temperature of around 180¬∞C (350¬∞F). To test the readiness, drop a small piece of wrapper into the oil‚Äîit should sizzle and float to the top quickly. Fry the dumplings in batches, making sure not to overcrowd the pan. Fry for about 3-4 minutes, turning occasionally, until they turn golden brown and crispy on all sides.

4. Once the dumplings are fried, remove them from the oil using a slotted spoon and place them on a plate lined with kitchen paper to drain any excess oil.

5. Prepare the dipping sauce by combining soy sauce, rice vinegar, sesame oil, gochugaru, and toasted sesame seeds in a small bowl. Stir well to mix all the flavours, and taste to adjust the seasoning if needed.

6. Serve the dumplings hot, garnished with fresh coriander, thinly sliced red chilli, and a sprinkle of sesame seeds. Serve with the dipping sauce and enjoy!",t2_2t7zs0u,Fried vegan dumplings,0.99,384,1726743527.0,1726743527.0,9,Whiterabbit2000,1fki03b

Ingredients:
Vegetable or canola oil, for frying
1 block extra firm tofu; frozen, then thawed and pressed
1/2 c extra creamy oat milk 
1 tbsp apple cider vinegar
1 tbsp hot sauce
1 tbsp cornstarch

Nashville Hot Seasoning:
1/2 c melted vegan butter
2 tbsp cayenne pepper
1 tbsp brown sugar
2 tsp smoked paprika
1 tsp garlic powder
1 tsp onion powder
1/2 tsp chili powder
pinch of salt & pepper

Breading:
1/4 c flour
1/4 c panko or other fine bread crumbs
2 tbsp cornstarch
1 tsp salt
1 tsp black pepper
1 tsp paprika

Instructions:
First, prepare the Nashville Hot butter sauce in a small bowl by adding the Nashville Hot spices to the vegan butter. Mix well and set aside. 

Then, prepare your wet and dry dredge. Combine the oat milk, hot sauce, apple cider vinegar, and 1 tbsp cornstarch in a shallow dish and wisk ingredients together well. Allow to sit covered with a kitchen towel while preparing the other ingredients. 

Combine the breading ingredients together in another shallow dish. In a fry pan, heat about an inch of oil on medium-high heat. 

Take the thawed, pressed tofu and slice it so you will have about four evenly-sized ""patties"" and DO NOT pat them dry. Dredge each tofu patty first in the breading, then once, quickly, in the ""buttermilk"", then back in the breading again. Be sure each patty is thoroughly breaded. 

Check that the oil is hot enough by tossing a drop of water into the pan; if it immediately evaporates then the oil is ready for frying. Carefully place the breaded tofu in the hot oil and fry until golden (about 5 minutes each side). Place the patties on a paper towel to absorb excess oil. 

Brush the fried tofu with the Nashville Hot butter sauce and serve on toasted buns with pickles and vegan mayo! Serve with French fries, coleslaw, or a shredded cabbage salad. ",t2_92s78,Nashville Hot Tofu sammiches ü•µü§§,0.98,266,1726794147.0,1726794147.0,9,daeglo,1fl03xr

veganrecipes,"Ingredients:
2 c Soy Curls 
2 c vegetable broth or ""chick'un"" boullion (for soaking)
2 tbsp olive oil
1 large red onion, thinly sliced
Juice of 1 lemon
3 garlic cloves, minced
2 tsp ground cumin
2 tsp ground coriander
2 tsp paprika
1 tsp white vinegar
1 tsp ground fenugreek (or 1 tsp maple syrup)
1 tsp ground turmeric
1/2 tsp ground allspice
1/4 tsp ground cinnamon
1/4 tsp ground cardamom
1/4 tsp ground cloves
1/4 tsp cayenne pepper (optional)
Salt to taste
Fresh soft flour buns or rolls
Fresh veggies (thinly sliced raw red onion, tomato slices, sliced cucumber, chopped romaine lettuce)
Tahini sauce or vegan yogurt sauce

Instructions:
Place the Soy Curls in a large bowl and cover with hot vegetable broth. Let them soak for about 10 minutes until rehydrated. Drain and squeeze out excess liquid.

In a bowl, mix soy curls with olive oil, garlic, cumin, coriander, paprika, turmeric, allspice, cinnamon, cardamom, cloves, cayenne (if using), lemon juice, vinegar, and fenugreek. Toss until well-coated. Let marinate for at least 30 minutes, but an hour or more is better. 

You can broil the soy curls in the oven for a crispy texture. You can skewer the curls on two skewers, or spread them on a baking sheet and broil for a few minutes until they get some char.

Alternately, heat a large skillet over medium-high heat. Add the marinated soy curls and sliced onions. Cook, stirring occasionally, until the soy curls are golden brown and onions are caramelized, about 10-15 minutes. Season with salt to taste.

Warm the buns or rolls. Fill with the cooked soy curls mixture, fresh veggies, and drizzle with tahini sauce or vegan yogurt sauce. Add finely chopped fresh herbs like parsley or mint for extra flavor.

Serve with chips or fries! ",t2_92s78,"Egyptian-style ""Chick'un"" Shawarma",1.0,110,1722300619.0,1722300619.0,9,daeglo,1efg4kr

veganrecipes,"[Full recipe available here.](https://www.plantifulpalate.com/post/vegan-tofu-salmon)

Ingredients:
- 400g firm tofu
- Sea salt and cracked black pepper, to taste
- 1 tablespoon vegetable oil
- Fresh coriander, chopped, for garnish
- Fresh lemon wedges, for serving

Marinade:
- 1 tablespoon soy sauce
- 1 tablespoon tomato paste
- 1 tablespoon apple cider vinegar
- 1 teaspoon liquid smoke
- 1 teaspoon maple syrup
- 1/2 teaspoon smoked paprika
- 1/2 teaspoon garlic powder
- 1 sheet nori, crumbled

Sweet Chilli Glaze:
- 4 tablespoons sweet chilli sauce
- 1 tablespoon soy sauce
- 1 teaspoon rice vinegar
- 1/2 teaspoon sesame oil

Method:
1. Remove tofu from packaging and wrap in a clean kitchen towel or paper towels. Place on a plate, set another plate on top, and weigh it down with a heavy object (like a cookbook or a can) to press out excess liquid. Leave for 30 minutes.
2. Unwrap the pressed tofu and slice into four equal 'steaks'. Season each piece with a pinch of sea salt and cracked black pepper.
3. Combine the marinade ingredients in a shallow dish. Submerge the tofu steaks, ensuring all sides are coated. Leave to marinate for 30 minutes (overnight for best results), flipping halfway through.
4. Preheat a non-stick frying pan over medium heat. Add the vegetable oil. Once hot, place the tofu steaks in the pan, frying for 4-5 minutes on each side until golden and crispy.
5. In a small bowl, whisk together the sweet chilli glaze ingredients. Pour over the cooked tofu in the pan, coating evenly, and cook for an additional 1-2 minutes until the glaze is sticky and slightly reduced.
6. Arrange the tofu on a serving platter, drizzle any remaining glaze from the pan over the top, and garnish with fresh coriander.
7. Serve immediately with a side of your choice and lemon wedges to squeeze over.

veganrecipes,"This is a recipe I‚Äôve been working on for a bit and I‚Äôm sharing it now because I‚Äôm very happy with how it came out tonight. Carnivore approved too. It‚Äôs a relatively simple dish to prepare, it just takes some time. 

Base Seitan Ingredients: 
240g vital wheat gluten
120g all purpose flour
8g salt
20g garlic powder
20g onion powder
50g tomato paste
265g water

Preheat oven to 350F and line a loaf pan (I used an 8.5in x 4.5in pan) with parchment paper.

Whisk all dry ingredients together in large bowl.

Whisk tomato paste and water together until combined, then gradually pour the water/tomato paste mixture into the dry ingredients as you stir. Stir with a spatula until the dough is mostly combined and shaggy, then switch to using your hands to bring it all together. Knead just until everything is mixed together and the dough stops sticking to your hands. Form it into a ball. 

Place the dough ball into the loaf pan, and press down on it to spread it out so it fills the pan.  

Cover pan with aluminum foil and bake for 2 hours. After 2 hours, remove from oven and allow seitan to cool.

While seitan cools, prepare dredging mixes.

Dry Mix (omit cayenne for plain)
Whisk together:
250g all purpose flour
1 tbsp cayenne
2 tsp paprika 
1 tsp EACH: Onion Powder, Garlic Powder, Baking Powder, Salt

For the wet mix, stir together listed ingredients and then whisk in 2 tbsp of the corresponding dry mix to thicken. 

Wet Mix (Spicy):
250ml unsweetened neutral plant milk (I used almond)
1 tsp lemon juice or white vinegar
60ml hot sauce (I use Frank‚Äôs)
1/2 tsp salt
1/2 tsp pepper
2 tbsp spicy dry mix

Wet Mix (Plain):
250ml unsweetened neutral plant milk (I used almond)
1 tsp lemon juice or white vinegar
1/2 tsp mustard powder
1/2 tsp salt
1/2 tsp pepper (optional)
2 tbsp plain dry mix

Note: if you want to make half the seitan spicy and half plain, you should halve the amounts of dry/wet mix ingredients for each flavor to reduce waste.

Once seitan is cool enough to handle, cut the loaf into 4 equal size pieces, then divide those pieces into thirds - you should have 12 ‚Äútenders‚Äù total. Or you can cut them smaller for nuggets. One issue I ran into at this stage was that the ‚Äúcrust‚Äù was kind of tough and chewy in places, so after cutting into 4 pieces, I chose to trim it all off with a sharp knife. The inside was fine though. If you can think of anything I can try doing next time to keep the outside softer while baking, please let me know! 

Coat the tenders or nuggets in dry mix, wet mix, dry mix, wet mix, dry mix. Shake them off each time before putting them into the next container.

Fry in 350 degree oil (I used canola) until golden, then remove seitan to a paper towel lined dish for a minute or two to drain some of the oil. They needed only 1-2 minutes per side.

Let me know if you try making this! ",t2_64oc4kmo,Spicy (left) and Plain (right) Seitan Chicken Tenders (or nuggets),0.99,160,1728002700.0,1728002700.0,8,espressoyourlove,1fvmxpo
veganrecipes,"Vietnamese style Omelette 

Just egg, sliced shiitake mushrooms,  diced jalape√±os, halved cherry tomatoes, diced onions and minced garlic. 

Seasoned with mushroom/vegetable bouillon powder, soy sauce, vegan fish sauce salt msg and sugar and pepper.

before cooking: mix Just egg with a teaspoon of bouillon powder, a teaspoon of soy sauce, a teaspoon of vegan fish sauce, and salt msg and sugar to taste. (note: for me, I actually used a bit more than than a teaspoon of soy sauce and vegan fish sauce because I like it a bit more salty. Adjust to taste) 

1. On a non stick pan, medium high heat, oil on pan (maybe a couple tablespoons? add more if the pan looks dry), stir fry and cook down the onions mushrooms and jalapenos until slightly charred/browning. I added pinches of salt to these to help them release water. 

2. Add cherry tomatoes and let them cook down. Also added pinches of salt to help release water. 

3. once cherry tomatoes are  starting to wrinkle add garlic 

4. when the cherry tomatoes are even more wrinkled and blistered  add some pepper, smush them a bit to release the juices and stir. 

5. make sure evrything is evenly leveled and then pour in the Just egg mixture. 

6. Once you start to see the surface of the just egg bubbling turn down the heat to a medium low and just let it sit there (you can use this time to clean up!) 

7. Its cooked once the omelette can easily slide around the pan.  Before plating, sprinkle more black pepper over the omelette. Take it off the heat and flip and fold it onto your serving surface. 

8. Enjoy with some rice!

Ingredients:

	‚Ä¢	400g firm tofu, cubed
	‚Ä¢	1 tbsp vegetable oil
	‚Ä¢	1 large onion, finely chopped
	‚Ä¢	2 cloves garlic, minced
	‚Ä¢	1-inch piece of ginger, grated
	‚Ä¢	1 tsp cumin seeds
	‚Ä¢	1 tsp ground coriander
	‚Ä¢	1/2 tsp turmeric powder
	‚Ä¢	1 tsp garam masala
	‚Ä¢	2 large tomatoes, pureed
	‚Ä¢	500g fresh spinach
	‚Ä¢	1/2 cup coconut milk
	‚Ä¢	Salt, to taste
	‚Ä¢	Fresh coriander, chopped (for garnish)

Method

	1.	Bring a large pot of water to a boil and add a pinch of salt. While waiting, fill a bowl with ice water and set it aside. Add the fresh spinach to the boiling water and blanch for about 1-2 minutes until it turns vibrant green. Quickly transfer the spinach to the ice water to stop the cooking process and preserve its colour. Once cooled, drain the spinach and blend it into a smooth puree. Set aside.
	2.	Start by pressing the tofu to remove excess moisture. Wrap the tofu in a clean kitchen towel and place a heavy object on top for about 10 minutes. Once pressed, cut the tofu into 1-inch cubes and set aside.
	3.	Heat the vegetable oil in a large pan over medium heat. Add the cumin seeds and let them sizzle for a few seconds until fragrant. This step releases the aromatic oils that form the base of the dish‚Äôs flavour profile.
	4.	Add the chopped onions to the pan and saut√© them until they turn golden brown, about 5 minutes. The caramelisation of onions adds a natural sweetness that balances the earthy spices. Stir in the minced garlic and grated ginger, cooking until aromatic, about 2 minutes.
	5.	Pour in the pureed tomatoes and mix well with the onion, garlic, and ginger. Allow this mixture to cook until the oil starts to separate from the masala base, about 5-7 minutes. This process is essential for developing the deep, rich flavours characteristic of Saag dishes.
	6.	Stir in the ground coriander, turmeric powder, and garam masala. Cook the spices for 2-3 minutes to bloom their flavours, enhancing the overall depth of the dish.
	7.	Add the pureed spinach and coconut milk to the pan, stirring to combine. Let the mixture simmer gently for about 5 minutes, allowing the spinach to meld with the spices and form a creamy base.
	8.	Gently fold in the tofu cubes, making sure they are well-coated with the spinach and spice mixture. Simmer for an additional 5 minutes to allow the tofu to absorb the flavours.
	9.	Adjust the seasoning with salt to taste. Garnish with freshly chopped coriander and serve hot with steamed basmati rice or naan.

It's refined sugar-free, gluten free and is made with a blend of silken tofu, cashews, and coconut yogurt instead of cream cheese, with a touch of miso paste for an umami boost! 

[IG post with more pictures](https://www.instagram.com/p/C8SCb2RID95/?igsh=OTE2bmJocGp1Y3h3) 

Ingredients (3-4 servings):

- 100g silken tofu ( I used @clearspringuk)
- 100g coconut yogurt (unsweetened)
- 50g cashews, soaked overnight
- 40g maple syrup or sweetener of choice
- 10g tapioca starch
- 1/2 lemon, juice and peel (highly recommended)
- 1/4 tsp white miso paste (very highly recommended; sub shio koji or salt)
- 1/2 tsp vanilla extract, optional 

Directions:


1. Preheat oven to 220¬∞C (Fan)


2. Blend all ingredients until the mixture is smooth. 


3. Strain and transfer batter into a parchment-lined springform pan pr bakeware of choice. Optionally pop bubbles with a blowtorch.


4. Baked at 220c for about 22-25 minutes (second highest rack, until the top is dark golden and center is slightly jiggly). Place a water bath on the lowest rack of the oven. This helps to create a moist baking environment, which prevents cracks and drying out (especially as the batter contains tofu).


5. Remove the cheesecake from the oven and let it cool at room temperature for about an hour.


6. Once cooled, cover the cheesecake and let it rest overnight in the fridge. This allows the cake to set properly.


7. Slice and serve chilled - topped with your favourite sauce!

veganrecipes,"Ingredients: 6 Impossible or Beyond Patties (Fully thawed but cold). 1 can of Jackfruit in Brine (Drain Brine, Remove Seeds & Break Apart Jackfruit).
Vital Wheat Gluten and Liquid Smoke of Your Choice.

Materials: 1 Large Bowl & 2 Large Cutting Boards.

Instructions:
1. In a large bowl add 3 Impossible or Beyond Patties, 1 handfuls of Jackfruit, 1 Tablespoon of liquid smoke of your choice & two tablespoons of vital wheat gluten. The seitan will act as a binding agent. Incorporate ingredients with both hands and then form into a ball. (Repeat this process with the remaining 3 plantbased patties).

2. Now get a large cutting board, spray it with non stick cooking spray and shape meatball  into a rectangle. Use another large cutting board for the other ‚Äúmeatball‚Äù and spray with non stick cooking spray. 

Your rectangle should not be too thick or too thin but somewhere in the middle so that your ribs won‚Äôt fall apart during the cooking process. Get 6 to 7 medium sized popsicle sticks and place them a few centimeters apart on top of one of your rectangle shaped jackfruit ‚Äúmeat.‚Äù Carefully place the other rectangle on top of the rectangle that has the popsicle sticks on top. Add an additional two tablespoons of vital wheat gluten on top of your slab of ribs and pinch/seal all edges. The seitan will also help with sealing faster. Once you have it fully sealed, gently pick slab of ribs up with both hands to make sure ribs are sturdy or won‚Äôt break apart.

3. Bake or Barbecue üî• your barbecue jackfruit spareribs. I love to Char them using Kingford‚Äôs High Heat Charcoal on a Weber Jumbo Joe. If you choose to grill, pre bake ribs for 20 mins. 10 minutes on both sides high 450 degrees. Be gentle when flipping ribs in the oven and on the grill. Serve with your favorite barbecue sauce & side dishes. Enjoy üòäü§ç",t2_cs54ydvsc,Barbecue Jackfruit üî• Spareribs Recipe,0.98,112,1719789429.0,1719789429.0,6,purplerain0123,1dseg33

Recipe:
Ingredients:

For the Pakoras:  
- 200g gram flour (besan)  
- 1 tsp cumin seeds  
- 1 tsp ground coriander  
- 1/2 tsp turmeric powder  
- 1/2 tsp baking powder  
- Salt, to taste  
- 150ml water  
- Vegetable oil, for frying  
- Handful of fresh spinach, chopped

For the Kadhi:  
- 300g vegan plain yoghurt  
- 150g gram flour (besan)  
- 800ml water  
- 1 tbsp vegetable oil  
- 1 tsp cumin seeds  
- 1 tsp mustard seeds  
- 1/2 tsp fenugreek seeds  
- 1 large onion, finely chopped  
- 2 cloves garlic, minced  
- 1 tbsp grated ginger  
- 1 tsp turmeric powder  
- 1 tsp ground coriander  
- 1 tsp ground cumin  
- 1/2 tsp red chilli powder (optional, for extra heat)  
- Salt, to taste  
- Handful of fresh spinach leaves

For Serving:  
- Steamed basmati rice

Method:

1. Prepare the Pakoras: In a mixing bowl, combine the gram flour, cumin seeds, ground coriander, turmeric powder, baking powder, and salt. Gradually add the water, mixing well to form a thick batter. Stir in the chopped spinach until well combined.

2. Heat vegetable oil in a deep frying pan over medium heat. Once hot, drop spoonfuls of the pakora batter into the oil, frying until golden brown and crisp on all sides, about 4-5 minutes. Remove with a slotted spoon and drain on paper towels. Set aside.

3. Prepare the Kadhi: In a separate mixing bowl, whisk together the vegan yoghurt, gram flour, and water until smooth and free of lumps. Set aside.

4. In a large saucepan, heat the vegetable oil over medium heat. Add the cumin seeds, mustard seeds, and fenugreek seeds. Let them splutter for about 30 seconds, releasing their aromatic flavours.

5. Add the finely chopped onion and saut√© for 4-5 minutes until softened and lightly golden. Stir in the minced garlic and grated ginger, cooking for another 1-2 minutes until fragrant.

6. Add the turmeric powder, ground coriander, ground cumin, and red chilli powder (if using). Stir well to coat the onion mixture with the spices.

7. Gradually pour in the yoghurt and gram flour mixture, stirring constantly to avoid lumps. Bring the kadhi to a gentle boil, then reduce the heat and let it simmer for about 15 minutes, stirring occasionally until it thickens slightly.

8. Add the pakoras to the kadhi and gently simmer for another 5-7 minutes, allowing the pakoras to absorb some of the curry's flavours. Add the fresh spinach leaves and let them wilt into the curry for the final 2 minutes of cooking. Season with salt to taste.

9. While the kadhi is simmering, rinse 300g of basmati rice under cold water until the water runs clear. In a medium saucepan, add the rinsed rice and 600ml of water. Bring to a boil over medium-high heat, then reduce to a simmer, cover, and cook for 12-15 minutes, or until the rice is tender and the water is absorbed. Fluff with a fork before serving.

10. Serve: Ladle the Vegan Kadhi Pakora into bowls and serve with the cooked basmati rice. Garnish with additional fresh spinach or coriander leaves if desired.

Ingredients:

	‚Ä¢	400g vegan tagliatelle
	‚Ä¢	2 tbsp olive oil
	‚Ä¢	1 clove garlic, minced
	‚Ä¢	100g fresh basil leaves
	‚Ä¢	50g rocket (arugula), plus extra for garnish
	‚Ä¢	30g pine nuts
	‚Ä¢	3 tbsp nutritional yeast
	‚Ä¢	100ml extra virgin olive oil
	‚Ä¢	Juice of 1/2 lemon
	‚Ä¢	Salt and freshly ground black pepper
	‚Ä¢	100g sun-dried tomatoes, drained and roughly chopped
	‚Ä¢	80g pitted black olives

Method:

	1.	Bring a large pot of salted water to a boil. Add the tagliatelle and cook according to the package instructions, or until al dente. Once cooked, drain and reserve a cup of the pasta cooking water. Set the tagliatelle aside.
	2.	While the pasta is cooking, prepare the pesto. In a food processor, combine the fresh basil leaves, rocket, pine nuts, nutritional yeast, lemon juice, and minced garlic. Blend until well combined, slowly pouring in the extra virgin olive oil while processing until a smooth pesto forms. Season with salt and black pepper to taste.
	3.	In a large frying pan, heat 2 tablespoons of olive oil over medium heat. Add the drained sun-dried tomatoes and saut√© for 2-3 minutes, allowing their flavours to deepen. Add the pitted black olives and stir well to combine, letting them warm through for another minute.
	4.	Reduce the heat to low and add the cooked tagliatelle to the pan. Toss gently to coat the pasta with the sun-dried tomatoes and olives. Add the prepared pesto to the pasta, using a little of the reserved pasta cooking water if needed to help loosen the sauce and ensure every strand is evenly coated.
	5.	Once everything is well combined and heated through, remove from the heat. Serve the tagliatelle in bowls, garnishing with a handful of fresh rocket leaves for an added peppery bite.

Ingredients:

For the lava cakes:
* 100g dark chocolate (70% cocoa, vegan)
* 60g vegan butter, plus extra for greasing
* 50g plain flour
* 30g cocoa powder (preferably dutch-processed)
* 70g caster sugar
* 1/2 teaspoon baking powder
* 1/4 teaspoon salt
* 120ml almond milk (or any plant-based milk)
* 1 teaspoon vanilla extract

For serving:
* 4 scoops of vegan vanilla ice cream
* 50g dark chocolate, melted (for drizzle, optional)

Method:
1. Preheat the oven to 200¬∞C (180¬∞C fan) or gas mark 6. Generously grease 4 ramekins with vegan butter and dust with cocoa powder. Place the ramekins on a baking tray for easier handling.
2. Chop the dark chocolate into small pieces and melt it with the vegan butter in a heatproof bowl set over a saucepan of simmering water. Stir occasionally until smooth and glossy, then remove from heat and allow to cool slightly.
3. In a mixing bowl, sift together the flour, cocoa powder, caster sugar, baking powder, and salt.
4. In a separate bowl, whisk together the almond milk and vanilla extract. Gradually add the wet ingredients to the dry, whisking until a smooth batter forms.
5. Gently fold the melted chocolate mixture into the batter. Take care not to overmix, as you want to maintain a light texture.
6. Spoon the batter evenly into the prepared ramekins, filling them about three-quarters full. Smooth the tops with the back of a spoon.
7. Bake the lava cakes in the preheated oven for 12-15 minutes, or until the edges are firm and slightly pulling away from the ramekins but the centres still appear soft and jiggly.
8. Remove the ramekins from the oven and let them cool for 2-3 minutes. Run a knife around the edges to loosen the cakes, then carefully invert each ramekin onto a serving plate. Tap gently to release the cakes.
9. Drizzle each cake with melted dark chocolate and then top with a scoop of vegan vanilla ice cream. Serve immediately while warm. And of course enjoy!",t2_2t7zs0u,Vegan Chocolate Lava Cakes,0.99,298,1733681717.0,1733681717.0,6,Whiterabbit2000,1h9oxx2

1 can (15oz) of pure pumpkin (roughly 2 cups)
1 block (11oz) of firm silken tofu (I use Mori Nu)
3/4 of a cup sugar
2tbs of maple syrup (optional, I sometimes use brown sugar)
1tsp vanilla extract
3tbs corn starch
1tsp cinnamon 
1tsp nutmeg
1/4tsp ground clove
1/4tsp ginger
1/4tsp allspice

Blend until fully combined and there is no visible tofu. Pour into your favorite pie crust and bake at 350f for one hour. Let cool for an hour before covering and placing in the fridge overnight.

veganrecipes,"I've been making mapo tofu for over a year, experimenting with different types mushrooms (or no mushrooms), chilli bean pastes and choice of stock. Happy to share a version I made last week (pic 1) which is the best mapo tofu I've had till date, restaurants included! Would love to hear your thoughts or any personal tweaks you swear by for your version of Mapo Tofu :)

Recipe (2 servings) : 
Ingredients: 

1 tbsp oil
1 green onion, chopped
1 tbsp sliced garlic
1 tbsp finely chopped ginger
1/4 cup dried porcini mushrooms
2 tbsp fermented chilli bean paste (Juan Cheng's recommended for the best flavor)
1 tsp ground Sichuan pepper
1 cup porcini mushroom soaking liquid
300g silken tofu
1 tsp light soy sauce
1/2 tsp sugar or sweetener
1/2 tbsp cornstarch (1 tbsp for a thicker sauce) mixed with 2 tbsp water
Optional: Green onions and white sesame seeds for garnish 

Directions:

Prep:

1. Rehydrate porcini mushrooms in hot water. Let them steep for 20-30 minutes, then strain, reserving the liquid for the stock.

2. Toast about a tbsp of Sichuan peppercorns until fragrant (about 2 minutes on medium flame). Grind them into ; you'll use this twice in the recipe.

3. Optionally, gently boil the silken tofu in lightly salted water to enhance flavor and slightly firm up the texture. This makes it less prone to crumbling during the stir-frying process.

Cooking:

1. Heat oil in a wok or pan over medium heat.

2. Add the green onions, garlic, and ginger, stirring for 2-3 minutes.

3. Mix in the chopped porcini mushrooms, saute for 3 minutes. Optionally, add a tablespoon of the soaking liquid midway to prevent any burning.

4. Stir in the broad bean chili paste and sugar (if using), blending it well with the saut√©ed mixture.

5. Add warm or hot mushroom soaking liquid, light soy sauce, sweetener (if not using sugar) and half the amount of ground Sichuan pepper. Let it simmer gently to infuse the flavors.

6. Gently add the tofu, trying not to break the cubes, and ensure they are well-coated with the sauce. Cover and Simmer for 10 minutes.

7. Add cornstarch slurry, gently stir. Simmer, uncovered for another 3 minutes or until the sauce reaches  your desired consistency.

8. Sprinkle remaining sichuan pepper over the dish.
 
9. Garnish with green onions / sesame seeds, Serve and enjoy!

Notes:

- Porcini mushrooms offer the best umami depth of flavour (other mushrooms I've tried are oyster mushrooms and fresh and dried shiitake) without overpowering the overall flavour profile. A 1:4 mushroom to liquid ratio worked best for me.


- I recommend getting a good quality Chilli Bean paste (google Pixian chilli bean paste). It is the cornerstone of this dish, and the right one can elevate your Mapo Tofu from good to sublime. Juan Cheng's Sichuan Chilli Bean Sauce has given me the best results.


- Highly recommend boiling the silken tofu in salted water. It does make a difference in the texture and taste of the tofu!


- Also highly recommend toasting whole peppercorns and grinding it yourself rather than using pre ground sichuan pepper powder.

Recipe:
Ingredients:

For the vegan meatballs:
    * 1 can (400g) of chickpeas, drained and rinsed
    * 1 cup of breadcrumbs
    * 1/2 cup of chopped onions
    * 3 cloves garlic, minced
    * 1/4 cup fresh parsley, chopped
    * 2 tbsp tomato paste
    * 2 tbsp soy sauce
    * 1 tbsp nutritional yeast
    * 1 tsp dried oregano
    * 1/2 tsp smoked paprika
    * Salt and pepper to taste
    * 2 tbsp olive oil for frying

For the spaghetti and sauce:
    * 400g spaghetti
    * 2 tbsp olive oil
    * 1 onion, finely chopped
    * 4 cloves garlic, minced
    * 1 can (400g) crushed tomatoes
    * 1 tsp dried basil
    * 1 tsp dried oregano
    * Salt and pepper to taste
    * Fresh basil, chopped for garnish
    * Vegan Parmesan cheese, for topping

Method:
1. Begin by preparing the meatballs. In a large mixing bowl, mash the chickpeas using a fork or potato masher until slightly chunky but mostly smooth.
2. Add breadcrumbs, chopped onions, garlic, parsley, tomato paste, soy sauce, nutritional yeast, oregano, and smoked paprika. Season with salt and pepper to taste. Mix until all ingredients are well combined.
3. Shape the mixture into 16-20 balls, about the size of a golf ball. If the mixture is too crumbly, add a bit more tomato paste or a splash of water.
4. Heat olive oil in a large frying pan over medium heat. Fry the meatballs in batches, turning them until all sides are golden brown and crisp, about 8-10 minutes. Remove from the pan and set aside.
5. Cook the spaghetti according to the package instructions until al dente. Drain and set aside.
6. For the sauce, heat olive oil in the same pan used for the meatballs. Add the chopped onion and garlic, saut√©ing until fragrant and translucent, about 3-4 minutes.
7. Pour in the crushed tomatoes, dried basil, and oregano. Season with salt and pepper. Simmer the sauce for 10-15 minutes, allowing the flavours to meld together.
8. Add the meatballs back into the sauce, gently stirring to coat them evenly. Let the meatballs simmer in the sauce for an additional 5 minutes.
9. Serve the meatballs and sauce over a bed of spaghetti. Garnish with fresh basil and a sprinkle of vegan Parmesan cheese.

veganrecipes,"I love char siu buns and I wanted to try my hand at a good vegan version. I replaced the pork with a mix of tofu (for firm meatiness) and eggplant (for fattiness). 

First I roasted a whole eggplant, just stabbed it with a knife a few times and put it in the oven for about an hour at 350 degrees. Then I opened it and scooped out the flesh when cool enough. I salted it for flavor and to draw out the moisture a bit. All that was done a couple days in advance. When it was time to cook I squeezed as much liquid as I could out with a strainer. 

For the tofu I bought firm cottony type and sliced it into planks that I froze for a few days. Freezing helps to get the water out and given it a meatier texture. I would use extra firm or super firm tofu next time.  Once it was time to get cooking I microwaved the frozen tofu until it water stopped coming out. Then I gave the planks a quick fry to get both sides golden brown. When they were out of the pan and cool enough to handle I broke them into small pieces by hand to give it a more natural texture than sliced cubes.

After all that was done I just used this recipe for the rest (left out the skim milk powder): https://www.marionskitchen.com/chinese-bbq-pork-steamed-buns/ The video mentions cake flour so I used that instead of all purpose but I‚Äôm sure either would work.

Overall I was really happy with the results! Tasted pretty much exactly like the pork version. Next time I might use some red food coloring for that classic look but that‚Äôs the fault of the sauce.

veganrecipes,"Snowskin Matcha Mooncake with Sweet Red Bean and Nuts Filling üíö

I love mooncakes, especially the mochi or snowskin variety - chewy delights with a surprise inside and so fun to make! This recipe uses a modified version of Souped Up Recipes' Snowskin wrapper recipe. The filling is a delicious sweet red bean energy bar I often meal prep. Highly recommend using cacao butter in the wrapper (cacao butter + sweetener + milk gives it a white chocolate undertone).

[Instagram Video Link](https://www.instagram.com/reel/C-71_C9oHHu/?igsh=MXh4dWl6cDVqZjV3Zg==)

Ingredients (14 Mooncakes - 25g Snowskin, 30g Filling):

Snowskin Mochi / Wrapper: 
  - 35g glutinous rice flour
  - 35g regular rice flour
  - 25g cornstarch (substitute for wheat starch)
  - 30g icing sugar
  - 10g matcha powder (I used Ted)
  - 20ml melted cacao butter (highly recommended, or substitute with oil/melted butter)
  - 15ml maple syrup (or your preferred liquid sweetener)
  - 140ml soy milk (or your choice of milk)

Red Bean Filling:
  - 150g sweet red bean paste
  - 2 tbsp peanut butter
  - 2 tbsp chopped dried fruits (e.g., apricots, cranberries)
  - 1/2 cup chopped nuts and/or seeds (e.g., walnuts, almonds, hazelnuts, hemp seeds, sesame seeds)
  - 1/4 cup desiccated coconut flakes
  - 1/4 tsp salt

For Dusting:
  - About 2 tbsp lightly toasted glutinous rice flour

Optional: Edible Gold Glitter Spray

Directions:

i. Prepare Red Bean Filling (Energy Ball):
   - Mix sweet red bean paste and peanut butter until smooth.
   - Stir in dried fruits, coconut, and chopped nuts/seeds.
   - Divide into 30g balls and refrigerate.

ii. Prepare Snowskin/Mochi Wrapper:
   - In a microwave-safe bowl, sift together glutinous rice flour, cornstarch, icing sugar, and matcha powder.
   - Add milk and cacao butter, stirring until smooth.
   - Cover loosely and microwave for 1 minute (800W).
   - Stir, then microwave in 30-second intervals for 2 more minutes until doughy (no liquid remains).
   - Alternatively steam the mixture for 25-30 minutes. 
   - Refrigerate (covered) for 10 minutes to cool slightly.
   - Knead the dough for about 5 minutes until completely smooth.

iii. Assemble:
   - Divide dough into 25g portions.
   - Flatten each portion between two sheets of parchment paper into discs.
   - Place a red bean energy ball in the center of each disc and seal.
   - Shape using a mold (dust with lightly toasted glutinous rice flour for easy unmolding) or by hand.

iv. Chill: Refrigerate for at least 1 hour.

v. Serve: Enjoy chilled, warmed or lightly pan-fried for a crunchy base (not traditional, but the texture contrast is fantastic!). They mooncakes are also freezer-friendly.

Ingredients:

For the Tortellini Dough:
- 300g all-purpose flour
- 100g semolina flour
- 1 tsp salt
- 150ml warm water
- 2 tbsp olive oil

For the Tortellini Filling:
- 150g firm tofu, crumbled
- 2 tbsp nutritional yeast
- 1 clove garlic, minced
- 1 tbsp lemon juice
- 100g fresh spinach, wilted and chopped
- Salt and freshly ground black pepper, to taste

For the Tomato Cream Sauce:
- 2 tbsp olive oil
- 1 large onion, finely chopped
- 3 cloves garlic, minced
- 1 tsp dried basil
- 1 tsp dried oregano
- 1/2 tsp chilli flakes (optional)
- 400g canned chopped tomatoes
- 3 tbsp tomato pur√©e
- 200ml coconut cream (or unsweetened oat cream)
- 2 tbsp nutritional yeast
- 1 tsp sugar (optional, to balance acidity)
- Salt and freshly ground black pepper, to taste

To Serve:
- Freshly ground black pepper
- Fresh basil leaves (optional)

Method:

1. To make the tortellini dough, mix the all-purpose flour, semolina flour, and salt in a large bowl. Make a well in the centre and pour in the warm water and olive oil. Mix until a dough forms, then knead on a floured surface for 8-10 minutes until smooth and elastic. Wrap in cling film and let rest for 20 minutes.

2. For the filling, combine the crumbled tofu, nutritional yeast, minced garlic, lemon juice, chopped spinach, salt, and black pepper in a bowl. Mix well until fully combined.

3. Roll out the dough on a floured surface until very thin (about 2mm thick). Use a 7-8cm round cutter to cut out circles of dough. Place a small teaspoon of the filling in the centre of each circle. Fold the dough over to form a half-moon, pressing the edges to seal. Bring the two corners of the half-moon together and pinch to form a tortellini shape. Repeat with the remaining dough and filling.

4. Bring a large pot of salted water to a boil. Cook the tortellini in batches for 3-4 minutes, or until they float to the surface. Remove with a slotted spoon and set aside.

5. In a large frying pan, heat the olive oil over medium heat. Add the chopped onion and saut√© for 6-8 minutes until softened and translucent. Stir in the minced garlic and cook for another 1-2 minutes until fragrant.

6. Add the dried basil, oregano, and chilli flakes (if using) to the pan, stirring to combine. Let the spices toast lightly for about 30 seconds to release their flavours.

7. Stir in the canned chopped tomatoes and tomato pur√©e. Bring the mixture to a simmer and let it cook for 8-10 minutes, stirring occasionally, until the sauce has thickened slightly.

8. Reduce the heat to low and stir in the coconut cream and nutritional yeast. Taste and adjust the seasoning with salt, black pepper, and a pinch of sugar if the sauce is too acidic. Let the sauce cook for another 2-3 minutes until creamy and well combined.

9. Add the cooked tortellini to the sauce, gently tossing to coat each piece in the rich, creamy tomato sauce. Ensure the tortellini are evenly covered and heated through.

10. Serve the tortellini in bowls, topped with a sprinkle of freshly ground black pepper and fresh basil leaves if desired.",t2_2t7zs0u,Creamy Tomato Vegan Tortellini,0.99,262,1734791658.0,1734791658.0,4,Whiterabbit2000,1hjb0q2

Highly recommend using cacao butter in the Snowskin batter for the best flavour and ideal firmness. Best substitute would be coconut oil. Oil can be used but the Snowskin would be relatively softer and may not hold shape as well as when made with cacao butter / coconut oil. 

[Instagram Recipe Link](https://www.instagram.com/reel/DAyP3ZSIZtJ/?igsh=MTVlaGc2bmFzbjNqMA==)

Ingredients (6 Mooncakes, 50g each):

Black Sesame Snowskin:

- 20g rice flour, toasted
- 20g glutinous rice flour, toasted
- 20g icing sugar
- 10g wheat starch (sub corn starch)
- 12g melted cacao butter
- 65g milk of choice (I used unsweetened almond milk)
- 1 tbsp black sesame, toasted

Black Sesame and Walnut Filling:

100g black sesame paste (Got it from the local Asian store, brand Honor)
20g glutinous rice flour, toasted
30g chopped walnuts, toasted

Directions 

i. Prepare Snowskin/Mochi Wrapper:

- In a dry pan over medium heat, roast the glutinous rice flour until slightly golden and fragrant.

- In a microwave-safe bowl, sift together roasted glutinous rice flour, cornstarch, icing sugar, and matcha powder.

- Add warm milk and melted cacao butter, stirring until smooth.

- Cover loosely and microwave for 1 minute (800W).

- Mix with a silicone spatula until smooth. Then microwave in 30-second intervals for 2 more minutes until doughy (no liquid remains).

- Alternatively, steam the mixture for 25-30 minutes.

- Refrigerate (covered in cling film) for 10 minutes to cool slightly.

- Knead the dough for about 5 minutes until completely smooth. 

- Refrigerate dough for 1-3 hours or overnight. The use of cacao butter helps with form texture once cooled. Hence even 1 hour is sufficient. If using oil, sufficient firming would take longer. 

ii. Prepare toasted walnuts:

- Toast walnuts at 190C (fan) for 10 mins 
- Let it cool for at least 10 minutes. 
- Scrub the walnuts between palms and use a fine sieve to separate it's skin
- Chop into smaller pieces

iii. Prepare filling: 

- Mix sweet black sesame paste and toasted glutinous rice flour until well combined. 
- Fold in the toasted walnuts.
- Portion into 25g balls
- Refrigerate for 3 hours or freeze for an hour for firmer texture (Helps while covering with Snowskin wrapper). 

iv. Assemble:

- Divide the Snowskin wrapper dough into 25g portions.

- Flatten each portion between two sheets of parchment paper into discs.

- Place filling in the center of each disc and seal.

- Shape using a mold (dust with lightly toasted glutinous rice flour for easy unmolding) or by hand.

v. Optional: Apply Gold Dust:

- Mix gold dust with a few drops of oil to create a smooth, paintable consistency.

- Use a fine brush to carefully apply the gold to the surface of the mooncakes for an elegant finish. 

vi. Serve:

Enjoy chilled, warmed, or lightly pan-fried for a crunchy base (not traditional, but the texture contrast is fantastic!). These mooncakes are also freezer-friendly.

veganrecipes,"This dish is inspired by the traditional Chinese Almond Tofu. The combination of melt in your mouth texture of the pudding paired with the viscous saffron and rose flavoured apricot syrup is absolutely delicious. üòã

Ingredients (Serves 2):

- **For the Pudding:**
  - 500 ml almond milk (I used 20% homemade blend)
  - 1/2 tsp agar agar powder
  - 2 tbsp sugar
  - 1/8 tsp almond extract

- **For the Apricot Saffron Syrup:**
  - 1/4 cup apricot conserve
  - 1/2 cup water
  - A few strands of saffron
  - 1/8 tsp rose water

Instructions:

1. Begin by soaking the agar agar in almond milk for about 5 minutes.

2. Heat the mixture on medium flame, bring it to a boil, then simmer for 5 minutes, whisking continuously. Ensure it doesn't boil over.

3. Add sugar and continue whisking until it fully dissolves, roughly 2-3 minutes.

4. Mix in the almond extract and turn off the heat.

5. Pour the mixture into your chosen container or mould. Allow it to cool at room temperature for about 20 minutes, where it should begin to set, then refrigerate for at least an hour.

7. Simmer the apricot conserve with water until bubbles form, about 3 minutes on medium heat.

8. Add the ground saffron, simmer for another minute, then remove from heat and stir in rose water.

veganrecipes,"If you don‚Äôt know Logan, he‚Äôs famous for his cucumber recipes on TikTok. You can find him there under @logagm, I think he‚Äòs also on Instagram. 

You need a container with a lid: first you slice the cucumber into the container. Then you add kapers with some juice, a big spoon of vegan cream cheese (I use one with herbs in it), half of an avocado, some lemon juice and some vegan salmon.
Since I don‚Äôt own an ‚Äûeverything but the bagel‚Äú seasoning mix, I put in some sesame seeds, garlic and onion powder, as well as some pepper, salt and MSG (obviously). Then you close the container and shake it until everything is combined. Of course you can just mix it with cutlery, but shaking it is more fun! 
You can stop here, it tastes delicious as it is, but for some volume I like to add some lettuce and bean sprouts. ",t2_bfl6n,I veganized one of Logan‚Äôs cucumber recipes,0.95,108,1730551974.0,1730551974.0,3,ninja-fox,1ghvqtz

Ingredients: 
1 cup textured soy 
Spices to taste (I used bay leaves, cumin, pepper, salt, paprika)
3 tablespoons of cassava starch or any other starch

Preparation:

Soak the soybeans in boiling water for 15 minutes. (The water can be vegetable broth, or it can have soy sauce added to it for flavor.) 
Once soaked and drained, add the seasonings and starch. 
Mix everything together and wrap the chorizos in plastic wrap suitable for cooking (as in the second photo) Tie two knots at the tip so it doesn't open. 
Boil for 40'
Once boiled, remove the plastic wrap and brown in the oven.

veganrecipes,"I came up with this recipe for kids refused to eat vegetables at all. I thought, why not make the food cute, fun, and intriguing something kids would actually enjoy? 

Here‚Äôs the recipe:

Ingredients:

	‚Ä¢	¬Ω cup green peas
	‚Ä¢	¬Ω cup carrots, chopped
	‚Ä¢	¬Ω cup corn kernels
	‚Ä¢	Salt, to taste
	‚Ä¢	Garlic powder, to taste
	‚Ä¢	Onion powder, to taste
	‚Ä¢	1 radish (peeled and grated)
	‚Ä¢	1 small beetroot (peeled)
	‚Ä¢	Black sesame seeds (for decoration)

Instructions:

	1.	Prepare the Vegetables:
	‚Ä¢	Boil the green peas, carrots, and corn kernels separately until soft.
	‚Ä¢	Mash each one individually and season each with salt, garlic powder, and onion powder.
	‚Ä¢	Shape the mashed vegetables into small balls‚Äîgreen (peas), orange (carrots), and yellow (corn). Set them aside.
	2.	Create the Pink Coating:
	‚Ä¢	In a pot, boil the grated radish together with the peeled beetroot. The beets will naturally dye the radish a beautiful pink color.
	‚Ä¢	Once cooked, strain the radish and let it cool and dry.
	3.	Assemble the Veggie Balls:
	‚Ä¢	Roll each vegetable ball (green, orange, yellow) into the pink-colored grated radish until fully coated.
	‚Ä¢	Use black sesame seeds to add tiny ‚Äúeyes‚Äù and make them look cute and playful.
	4.	Serve and Enjoy:
	‚Ä¢	Arrange the veggie balls in a bowl or bento box for a fun presentation.

Tip: Kids will love the cute look, and they might not even realize they‚Äôre eating veggies! Each balls will surprise them with 3 different colors üòâ

Ingredients:

For the Creamy Filling:
- 100g vegan cheese, grated  
- 2 tbsp olive oil  
- 1 large onion, finely chopped  
- 3 cloves garlic, minced  
- 400g potatoes, peeled and diced into small cubes  
- 200ml unsweetened almond milk  
- 100ml vegetable stock  
- 2 tbsp nutritional yeast  
- 1 tsp dried thyme  
- Salt and freshly ground black pepper, to taste

For the Filo Pastry:  
- 10 sheets filo pastry  
- 4 tbsp vegan butter, melted  
- 1 tbsp black sesame seeds  
- 1 tbsp white sesame seeds

Method:

1. Preheat your oven to 180¬∞C. In a large frying pan, heat the olive oil over medium heat. Add the finely chopped onion and saut√© for 6-8 minutes until softened and translucent. Stir in the minced garlic and cook for an additional 1-2 minutes until fragrant.

2. Add the diced potatoes to the pan and stir to combine. Pour in the almond milk and vegetable stock, bringing the mixture to a simmer. Cover and cook for 15-20 minutes, or until the potatoes are tender and the liquid has thickened slightly. Stir in the nutritional yeast, grated vegan cheese, dried thyme, salt, and black pepper. Mash some of the potatoes slightly with the back of a spoon to create a creamy texture, while leaving some chunks for added texture.

3. Lightly grease a baking dish. Lay one sheet of filo pastry into the dish, allowing the edges to hang over the sides. Brush with melted vegan butter, then layer another sheet of filo on top, brushing with more butter. Repeat until you have layered 5 sheets of filo.

4. Spoon the creamy potato filling into the baking dish, spreading it evenly. Fold the overhanging filo sheets over the filling, then layer the remaining 5 sheets of filo on top, brushing each layer with melted vegan butter. Tuck in the edges to create a neat finish.

5. Score the top layer of filo with a sharp knife to create squares, being careful not to cut all the way through. Sprinkle the black and white sesame seeds over the top.

6. Bake in the preheated oven for 25-30 minutes, or until the filo pastry is golden and crisp. Allow the pie to cool for a few minutes before cutting and serving.

veganrecipes,"I wish I could take credit for this recipe, but I totally just asked chatgpt for a vegan pastry recipe with ingredients I already had that would help me practice dough lamination. Turned out great, though.

Ingredients: For the Dough:

1 1/2 cups all-purpose flour
1 1/2 cups cake flour
1/4 cup sugar
1 tsp salt
2 tsp instant yeast
1 cup plant-based milk (like almond or oat), warm
2 tbsp vegan butter, softened
For the Lamination:

1 cup vegan butter, very cold (recommended to use a block-style butter)
For Assembly:

Vegan chocolate batons or chopped dark chocolate pieces
Instructions:

Prepare the Dough: In a large bowl, combine the cake and all-purpose flours, sugar, salt, and yeast. Add the warm plant milk and softened butter, kneading until the dough is smooth and elastic (about 8 minutes). Form into a ball, place in a greased bowl, cover, and let rise until doubled, about 1‚Äì1.5 hours.

Butter Block Preparation: Shape the cold vegan butter into a 6x6-inch square between two sheets of parchment paper. Chill until firm.

Lamination Process:

Roll out the dough into a 10x10-inch square and place the butter block in the center.
Fold the edges of the dough over the butter to enclose it completely.
Roll out the dough into a 20x10-inch rectangle, then fold it into thirds like a letter. Wrap in plastic and chill for 30 minutes.
Repeat this rolling and folding process two more times, chilling the dough each time.
Shape and Add Chocolate:

Roll out the dough into a large rectangle about 1/4 inch thick. Cut into smaller rectangles, roughly 3x5 inches.
Place a chocolate baton or small amount of chocolate at one end of each rectangle and roll up tightly.
Final Proofing: Place each rolled pain au chocolat on a baking sheet, seam side down. Cover lightly and let rise for 1‚Äì1.5 hours, until puffy.

Bake: Preheat the oven to 400¬∞F (200¬∞C). Bake for 15‚Äì20 minutes, until golden and flaky.

Serve: Let cool slightly, then enjoy warm with the melty chocolate inside",t2_atoloosi,Vegan pastries - pain au chocolat,0.99,160,1731262954.0,1731262954.0,1,Chamomile_Tisane,1go73wx
