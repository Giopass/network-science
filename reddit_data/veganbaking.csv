VeganBaking,"The third slide is two cookies, kind of on top of each other— it looks like one giant, misshapen cookie. It’s two lol. Second slide is a single cookie. First slide is a single cookie cut in half. 

Recipe is from here:  https://sycamorebakingblog.com/vegan-levain-cookies/

I didn’t include the walnuts, so I did add 50g of flour. I added a little extra sugar and vanilla. The 340g of chocolate did seem like a lot, at first. Before the cookies cooled down, the amount of chocolate was bit overpowering. Now, it’s okay. If you don’t like a ton of chocolate, maybe add less and just compensate by adding a couple tbsp more flour. The amount of mix-ins does help to minimize spread and provides stability. So, just something to consider. 

The cookies have completely cooled and are STILL gooey on the inside. Scaled them out to 6oz each. Since I did a little extra flour, I ended up with a little bit of leftover dough. So, I just ate it 🤷‍♀️ 

These still came out great and I accidentally poured the soy milk and extract in with the sugars and butter. I poured it back out and put in a small bowl off to the side. Then, I creamed the butter and sugar. I also didn’t use white room temp butter. I put it in the microwave for a little bit… like 10-12 seconds on one side and, then, 10-12 on the other side. Probably would just be easier to plan ahead, next time. But, yeah, even with those little mishaps, these still came out great. 

They barely spread. Just be aware.  My second batch seemed to spread a little more than my first. Either that, or I just got used to how they looked. Not sure, now that I think of it 🤔. I baked three at a time, on a half sheet. 

I did chill for 12 hours. Really, 13 hours. And I also did put in the freezer for 20 minutes prior to baking.

VeganBaking,"first time making vegan donuts and i learned a lot! …like how i should let them cool a little bit before dipping them in the glaze. they were so delicious though and i can’t wait to make more and get creative with the glaze/toppings and dough! 

recipe: 

Let’s Make Maple Donuts! 🍩

For the Dough: 

- 1 1/4 Cups [300mL] of Plant-Based Milk ( i used soy)
- 1 Packet of Yeast [or 2 1/4 tsp]
- 1 tsp [5 ml] Sugar 
- 1/3 cup [75g] Vegan Butter 
- 1/4 cup [50g] Sugar
- 1 tsp [5ml] Vanilla 
- 4 Cups [650g] Bread Flour 
- 1/4 tsp [1.2ml] Salt

Glaze:
  - 2 Cups [225g] Powdered Sugar 
- 2 Tbsp [30ml] Maple Syrup 
- 1/4 tsp [1.2ml]  Maple Extract 
- 2 Tbsp [30ml] Milk 
- Pinch of Salt (optional)

• Add yeast & 1 tsp of sugar to the warm mix and allow to bloom. 
• In a separate bowl, cream together the butter, sugar, and vanilla. 
• Once the yeast-milk has bloomed, add that to the butter and sugar mixture and mix. 
• Add the bread flour and 1/4 tsp salt and mix and knead until you get a smooth dough ball 
• Add the dough to a lightly greased bowl, cover, and let rise until it’s doubled in size. About 1-2 hours
• Roll out the dough and shape the donuts. 
• Place shaped donuts onto individual pieces of parchment paper and cover for 1 hour. 

• When ready to fry, place donuts in oil (that we allowed to get hot on LOW HEAT) along with the parchment paper. 
•CAREFULLY remove the parchment paper after a few seconds. Fry donut for 2-3 minutes each side. 
• Transfer to a cooling rack and let cool for a few minutes before dunking donut into maple glaze.

Maple Glaze: 

•Sift the powdered sugar into a bowl. 
• Add maple syrup, maple extract, and milk. Mix. 
• Add more milk for a runnier glaze, less for a thicker glaze. 
• Add a pinch of salt (optional)

VeganBaking,"Hi! I have been vegan for about 8 years and love to cook/bake so I'm decently experienced and knowledgeable as a home cook/baker but have never done so professionally. 

I have been working at a business unrelated to food for almost a year now, and frequently tell my coworkers about what I cooked the day before/show them photos of my food/bring in leftovers and extra sweets to share. I guess because of that plus the fact that I've shown that I am a hard worker, detail-oriented, organized, etc., the boss offered that I could start baking in the cafe that they also own to get some extra hours on my own schedule. 

I was taught the recipes for 2 types of cookies that they already sell there, but they aren't vegan (one has butter, the other has egg whites.) The boss told me that I can choose to sometimes make those options, but that I can also get creative and make ANYTHING that I want to try out. I can just run it by the cafe manager so he can approve to reimburse me for ingredients, and then have him sample it, and see if it sells well or not. 

This is obviously a great opportunity to add some more interesting vegan options to the rotation (They are fine with that, I'm not being sneaky about it or anything. There is definitely a market for vegan options in my area, most local cafes have multiple vegan baked goods and savory vegan options.) 

So, what would you want your local cafe to add as a vegan baked good? I have a list so far of ideas such as Earl grey cookies, banana muffins, apple muffins, no bake chocolate oatmeal cookies, savory scones... I want to start pretty simple since I've never done this before and I want to give vegan baked goods a good reputation. Other things they already sell include a nuts and seeds cookie, pecan tahini cookie, oat and berry bar, savory filled pastries, a few sandwiches that have egg or cheese... more emphasis on the beverages here than food so just smaller snacky type items.

I am looking to get them thin, crispy on the edges and still a little chewy in the center but not falling apart. I want them to turn a nice browned golden color on the tops but not be burnt or dry. My most recent batch I followed Purely Kaylie’s recipe online for her vegan chocolate chip cookies. I have used this recipe before and followed it to a T but still was not happy. Most recent batch I made I used vegan stick butter and cut the brown sugar by the tiniest bit. I flatten my cookies a bit with the back of a spatula before baking since I’m never satisfied with their thinness if I don’t do this step. I cooked at 350 for 18 min because they are never crispy enough any less time but I have followed the instructions with the time in the oven in the past but was not happy with crispness. I left them for 2 minutes in the oven turned off and then left on baking tray for like 10 before moving to cooling rack. Here’s a pic how they turned out. I have not tasted them yet but I want them more brown on the tops and want them to have the edges sort of crisp and taller and then centers more crinkly looking and slightly sunken down from the edges.

Apparently patience is the key ingredient for everything from baking to decorating, which is good because I can always use to work on it. 

I tweaked this cake recipe to make it Vegan, then I made up my own Peanut Butter Buttercream frosting using PB2, confectioners sugar, and butter. For the drizzle, I just took heavy plant based cream, Adams peanut butter, and confectioners sugar and blended until it was the texture I wanted. It's filled with a Peanut Butter cream made from silken tofu, heavy cream, PB2, Peanut Butter, confectioners sugar, salt, and vanilla and Whipped until light. It ended up being the consistency of like Bavarian cream that you fill donuts with, maybe a little lighter. I mostly just make things up as I go anymore so I can't give much more info than that.

VeganBaking,"I managed a naked cake with a design made of batter.

I did a sponge cake which was very dense (not sure why) that turned out to be perfect for piping. In fact, I had to add milk with the food coloring to make sure it was slightly thinner. Next time I'll add even more in the hopes that it will help remove the many air bubbles you can see. I did drop my pan on the counter before baking but the batter was slightly frozen so the air remained trapped.

I was slightly worried about using the sponge cake batter for the whole cake given its texture so I ended up doing my usual vanilla cake for the actual cake.

What I learned:
- You really don't need a lot of batter.  My sponge cake batter probably yielded 3-4 times more that what I needed.

- The sponge cake batter was totally pipeable.  It actually needs to be thinned out a little bit EXCEPT for the black which I used for the outline.  Next time, I'll (gently) drop the pan on the counter to remove air bubbles before freezing.

- Between the outline and the other colors, put the cake pan in the freezer for around 10 minutes.  This ensures that the design stays in place.  I also put it back in the freezer before I added the vanilla cake batter.  I made sure to add the cake batter from the outside in.  Not sure if it was necessary but I wanted to make extra sure the design wouldn't spread.

- Not sure how to fix this but the parchment paper ended up soaking moisture from the batter and became wavy which you can see on the design (the vanilla batter is totally flat though so I'm guessing my piping of the design took too long?).",t2_5gas1,I did it!,0.99,426,1731896008.0,1731896008.0,28,GotSomethingToSay,1gtu6ee

VeganBaking,"You guys. I can’t believe it took me this long to finally brown some vegan butter. I missed that depth of flavor!  I am so pleased with the taste of these cookies. Texture is good, too!  

Looking forward to experimenting more, again, now. I lost my fire for a bit, there.  My vegan cookies were “good,” but I was struggling to get the same depth of flavor that I used to get with my “regular” chocolate chip cookies. At first, I actually preferred vegan chocolate chip to “regular” chocolate chip. The taste was nostalgic.  It reminded me of these giant, super-soft chocolate chip cookies that were sold in our school cafeterias. They were 50¢ each and, sometimes, the lunch ladies would pull them nice and early. They’d be so fudgy and dense in the middle— barely baked cookie dough that managed to set just in time for lunch. The edges had just enough of a bite, but they were not “crisp.”  I never bought a hot lunch.  I never packed a lunch, either. I would, however, indulge in one of those cookies— at least twice a week.  I did that for years. Always told myself I was going to save at least half a cookie to bring home and warm up. All those years— not once did I possess the self control required to successfully complete such a task. 

Anyway, I had always wanted to recreate those cafeteria cookies and, until I started baking vegan, I couldn’t crack it. I didn’t realize that their classically simple, sweet, doughy taste was due to the fact that they weren’t made with butter. For a while, these types of vegan chocolate chip cookies sustained me. I rode that nostalgia train. Then, I got bored. I shook things up by baking off some Levain copycat recipes. That definitely helped… for a few days. After this three-day biscuit-like cookie binge, I went through a weird time. Baked oats had me in a chokehold. Cookie dough baked oats, to be exact, and I lost a bunch of weight. 

I was in a chocolate chip cookie depression, it seemed. Eventually, things progressed to the point where I wasn’t even “baking” these cookie dough oats anymore. I was.. microwaving them.  Then, I couldn’t even be bothered to do that. “Raw protein cookie dough?” I asked myself. “That’ll do.”  

For weeks, this continued. My mother asked me if eating the same exact thing, every single day, was healthy. “Probably not,” I’d shrug. 

So, I switched to chocolate chip cookie dough *pancakes* (with added protein, too).  I ate this, every day, for weeks, instead. Progress. 

Salvation came in the form of a Broma Bakery YouTube short. I can only watch so many shorts, of ingredients being thrown together, mixed up into a dough, portioned out, baked off, and devoured by some influencer with a cookbook, before I find myself needing to do the same. Minus publishing the cookbook. Last “night,” at 3AM, I decided to make some cookies. Proper [vegan] cookies. 

I knew I could brown vegan butter. I just had some weird aversion to actually following through with it. Fear of… disappointment, perhaps. Sheer laziness?  Whatever the case, I looked up a basic “brown butter chocolate chip cookie” recipe (not Broma Bakery’s, ironically enough) and I was off to the races.

This is the result. I only chilled the dough for 12 hours, but I’d like to do a full 24 and actually use dark brown sugar, instead of light brown. That was all I had, however. The cookies have all been eaten, now, but they truly continued to get better the longer they sat. I can only imagine how they’d be with a 24hr+ chill *and* a solid 12-hour… set?  

I heard roasted/toasted soy bean powder can also give a nutty taste to cookies. Really want to try that along with a… roasted vegan white chocolate ganache filling?  That would be so good. Maybe.. add some orange zest?!  A brown butter toasted cornmeal cookie sounds good, too— with some sort of berry (toasted cornmeal inspo from Justine Snacks). 

Anyway..

**TLDR**:  I hate to say it, but I sort of lost my ummpf when I started baking vegan. All it took to get it back was browning some Violife butter. I’m a simple (wo)man.  **Recipe** was from Pinch of Yum- https://pinchofyum.com/browned-butter-chocolate-chip-cookies

Used flax egg to sub for egg (2tbsp flax with 6tbsp water— I use hot water.  Not sure if that’s correct, but that’s what I always do). Browned a whole block of Violife butter. Added a couple tbsp of almond milk because I thought my dough needed to be a little wetter. Recipe has forgiving measurements— it’s very basic, so there’s wiggle room. I also threw in a few tsp of cornstarch. I was just doing whatever I wanted. Also, I used cake flour. That was all I had… aside from bread flour, oat flour, coconut flour.. and a couple of Gluten-Free blends. Of course, you could use AP flour, as called for. I ran out of vanilla, so I threw in a tbsp of dark amber maple syrup, instead. I used a little more brown sugar than cane sugar. Not sure it was enough to make any real difference, though. I used diamond kosher salt.  More than called for. Oh, and I finished with flaky salt— but smoked salt would be so cool, here. Scooped with 3tbsp cookie/portion scoop. 350F for 10-12 mins for softer cookies. Overnight chill recommended!   Cookies get a nicer color than the posted picture shows.

# Ingredients

* 1 pie crust homemade or store-bought
* 1½ cups granulated sugar (300g)
* ½ cup unsweetened cocoa powder (50g)
* 2 cups milk\* (480ml)
* 4 large egg yolks
* 3 tablespoons all-purpose flour
* ½ teaspoon salt
* ¼ cup unsalted butter cubed (57g)
* 1 teaspoon vanilla extract
* whipped cream for serving

# Instructions

* Preheat the oven to 400F.
* Line a 9-inch pie pan with pie crust and crimp as desired. Line with parchment paper and fill with pie weights. Bake for 20 minutes. Remove parchment and weights and continue baking until the edges and bottom are golden and appear dry, 10 to 15 minutes. Cool completely.
* In a medium saucepan, whisk together the sugar and cocoa powder. Slowly whisk in 1½ cups of milk until well combined. Place over medium-high heat and bring to a simmer, stirring frequently. Reduce the heat to medium-low.

Meanwhile, in a large heat-proof mixing bowl, whisk together the remaining ½ cup of milk, ***egg yolks***, flour, and salt until well combined. When the milk comes to a simmer, slowly whisk the hot milk into the egg mixture. Pour back into the saucepan.

* Cook over medium-low heat, stirring constantly until thickened and bubbling, about 5 minutes. Remove from the heat and stir in the butter and vanilla until melted and completely combined. Pour the pudding into the baked pie shell. (For an extra velvety filling, run the pudding through a fine mesh sieve before filling the pie.) Refrigerate (uncovered) for at least 4 hours or overnight before slicing. Serve with whipped cream, if desired.

VeganBaking,"I don't know if I'm going crazy but I feel like most baking recipes (vegan and non vegan) have INSANE amounts of sugar in them. Not even coming from a health perspective but from a taste perspective. I would say I have a sweet tooth but it's just so over the top. 

I half the sugar in a recipe as a general rule but even doing that I am blown away by the sweetness. I made brownies and it feels like I'm eating wet sugar flavoured with cocoa powder and flour. I couldn't imagine if I put the full amount and I'm gald I didn't serve it at a special occasion. 

I feel like recipe makers go full blast with the sugar from the start but they should start below threshold and work their way up until they get to the (literal) sweet spot. A treat you can indulge in but actually taste the other flavours. In my opinion, so many recipes are ruined by excessive sugar. 

Most of the time reducing it doesn't ruin the texture (talking about cakes, custards, or cookies) but I get that some things rely on a lot of sugar structually (merignues, buttercreams/icings). It's frustrating for me because I want to make something good the first time without tweaking the recipe so much, and it's hard to guess how much I should actually put in. Most of the time it's half, but sometimes that's still too much or not enough.

VeganBaking,"Sorry, I didn’t get a picture of the insides for you guys. I gave one to my sister, one to my mom, and then my fat🍑 ate the rest. 

These are so good and I put protein in them!  And, yes, that’s the actual color then come out. 

So, I don’t have an exact recipe… but, this is, generally, what I do: 

I start out with 2 big scoops of KOS unflavored, unsweetened protein powder. This comes out to about 34-40g of protein powder. I’ve also used Whole Foods unflavored pea protein powder. The Whole Foods one does have quite a bit less calories per serving, if you care about that. I’m sure your favorite protein powder will, generally, work here. It might alter the flavor, slightly, but it could be in a good way. I have added even more protein powder than this— like twice this amount.  You may just need to add a little more of the other ingredients, if you do that. 

Next, I do 16g of monk fruit light brown sugar 

60-75g of Siggi’s plant-based coconut yogurt. It’s vanilla-flavored.  I have used other coconut yogurts. I’m sure you can use other kinds. Just be sure it is rather thick. If it’s not so thick, you may have to use a little less. 

Up to 32g of cashew butter. I have done less, shy of half of that, depending on how much I care about calories that day. 

I also do 12-18g of coconut sugar and like 10-16g of maple syrup. You can adjust this range, based on what you like. 

1tsp vanilla. You can do more.  I’ve done as much as a tbsp.  Imitation is fine. Don’t use your good vanilla for this! 

A good pinch of Maldon smoked salt. A few grams at least. This is just what I use. Any salt is fine. Salt it to taste. It will likely not be sweet enough for some of you. You can add more towards the end, don’t worry. So be aware I have a rather vicious sweet tooth. If you do not, maybe be a bit more conservative with the sweetener amounts. Just taste as you go. 

1tsp of butter flavoring. Tiny bit more, if you want. You can wait till the end to do that. 

Up to 30g of oat flour.  If you add a little much and it’s too thick, add a few tsp of soy milk.  Any milk is fine, really. I mostly use soy, here.  I say “up to 30g” because that’s the serving size and I try not to make this even more calorie-dense than it is. This morning, however, I accidentally dumped 54g in. It still worked. 

This is when I taste again. If it needs to be sweeter, I add 5-7 drops of stevia vanilla creme drops. I stir, taste again, add 3-5 more drops (single drops, not the whole dropper), stir again, and taste again. Usually that’s fine. You can also add a sprinkle more of coconut sugar if you want more of that flavor, now, too.  

Then, I add some baking soda. This really helps give it a cookie dough taste!  I promise you.  I’ve put as much as 3/4tsp. That’s probably a bit too much haha. Start with 1/4tsp, taste it, add more if need be. 

The consistency, when you’re finished, should be like a slack cookie dough. It should be spreadable, but thick. Somewhere in between an ultra-thick batter and shortbread dough.  

Top with dark chocolate chunks, chips, shavings, or chopped chocolate.  I use Enjoy Life Mega Chunks; 80g. Usually, this works out to about 12 pieces. I bake the small ramekins for 12 mins at 350F, and that’s sufficient. You want the top to crack (see pics) just a little bit. If you want it a little mushier, bake for a bit less time. There’s really no “messing” these up. It’s a matter of preference. Be aware that it will firm up slightly as it sits and cools. The larger pan I used (pictured) is a 6x2 Fat Daddio’s cake pan. That takes about the same about of time; maybe a couple minutes more. Also, it does rise quite a bit when you bake it, so leave a little bit of room for that. It won’t overflow, it’ll kind of just puff up like a soufflé, if that makes sense. You can see that in the pictures of the smaller ramekins. Before eating, top with flaky sea salt and devour!  You can really eat it within 5 minutes of it coming out of the oven.  I’ve also added a scoop of vegan ice cream on top.  That’s so delicious. Salt the ice cream a little bit, also. 

You can even microwave these. Although the texture is not as great, it’s still very satisfying for something sweet and, mostly, healthy.  Also, when microwaving, I do it for 30 second intervals up to 1:30 (90 seconds). That tends to be enough.  Top with chocolate after, not before, when using the microwave. 

This amount makes about 2 ramekins (can see in pics) worth, or a small 6x2in pan (shown).  You’ll see that, once you make this a couple times, you’ll be able to easily tweak it to your liking and/or increase the serving size :)

VeganBaking,"Ok, so the question is in the title. At home I don't bake gluten free. But when dining or eating out, I have at times tried gluten free vegan cakes or cookies out of curiosity. With almost no exception, these baked goods have been horrendous. Either too dry, or fudgy/dense with no air and lift.

I'm not an expert on this, but it seems to me that gluten free vegan baking starts with a double disadvantage. Vegan baking to begin with omits eggs, which do so many things in non-vegan baking, inluding creating air and structure. But cutting-edge vegan bakers have largely solved the egg issue, IMO (using aquafaba, potato protein, etc). When you also go gluten free, however, you even lose out the gluten protein, which is responsible for much of the structure in baked goods. So to me it seems only logical that it will be very very hard to pull off really good gluten free vegan baking.

But so my question is: Are there examples of really good gluten free vegan baking? Is it possible to create gluten free and vegan baked goods which are not horrible? I assume it would be easier with simple cookies, for example, which do not depend that much on rise and air compared to cakes.

for a 20 cm pan

marble cake base  
100 g flour  
75 g white sugar  
1 tsp vanilla sugar  
1 tbsp baking powder  
1 pinch of salt  
2 tbsp vegetable oil  
125 g sparkling water  
1 tbsp dutch cocoa powder  

cheesecake  
500 g vanilla soy yogurt (other plant-based yogurts like oat or coconut tend to yield a flan or custard texture)  
150 g vegan cream cheese (almond and coconut oil based works well)  
80 g white sugar (add more if desired)  
1 slice of lemon (with the peel, seeds removed)  
60 g corn starch  
60 g raw pistachios, peeled and soaked in water for 1 hour  
2 tbsp raspberry powder (made from blending freeze-dried raspberries)  

decoration  
100 g vegan white chocolate  
1 tsp raspberry powder  
pistachios  

preheat the oven to 180 °C, brush a pan with vegetable oil and line with baking paper  

combine the dry ingredients (except cocoa powder), add the oil and sparkling water. mix until just combined, avoiding overmixing. divide the batter in half, add the cocoa powder to one portion and mix. to create the marbling, pour a layer of vanilla batter in the center of the pan, then add a spoonful of cocoa batter in the center, alternating until the batter is used up. bake for 10 min. meanwhile, prepare the cheesecake filling  

in a blender, add vanilla soy yogurt, vegan cream cheese, sugar, lemon slice, vanilla extract, and corn starch. blend for 1-2 minutes, scraping down any unmixed starch if necessary. pour half of this mixture into a separate bowl. in the blender, add the soaked pistachios to the remaining mixture and blend for another minute  

in the other half of the cheesecake mixture, add the raspberry powder and stir with a fork until smooth and clump-free  

pour a layer of the pistachio mixture onto the marble base, then alternate with the raspberry and pistachio mixtures. drag a knife or chopstick through the layers to create a swirled pattern  

bake for 45-60 min, or until the surface is dry and slightly browned. let cool at room temperature for 1 hour  

for the white chocolate topping, melt the white chocolate over a hot water bath, stirring continuously. spread ¾ of the melted chocolate onto the cheesecake. in the remaining chocolate, add the raspberry powder. dot the raspberry chocolate over the white chocolate layer and swirl with a toothpick. decorate with pistachios. chill in the fridge for at least 6 hours before serving",t2_ukaq5wap,raspberry pistachio cheesecake with marbled cake base💅🏻,1.0,689,1730224968.0,1730224968.0,16,yynnss1,1gf135x

VeganBaking,"Just continuing to experiment with Levain/“NYC”-type cookies. 

Excuse the crappy lighting.  My kitchen lighting is meh, but I didn’t care enough to search for better light. I also think my phone camera was a little fogged up around the edges. I think it only affected the picture in slide two. 

Jk I actually do care because I just went back and took a couple pictures in my dining room and cleaned my lens. Lighting isn’t great there, either, but those pictures still came out better than the picture in slide two..

Anyway… 

🍪 🍪 🍪:  

Recipe is from:  https://labelessnutrition.com/vegan-levain-chocolate-chip-walnut-cookies/

Some of these pictures were taken within 15 minutes of the cookies being taken out of the oven. The last ones were about 45 minutes after. I wanted these SOFT. The outside has the littlest bit of crunch. Just enough to encase the gooey middle. I’m sure you could increase the bake time, and decrease the size of the cookie, for a different experience. 

I didn’t add walnuts, so I did add more flour to compensate for less mix-ins. 

Made with VioLife salted butter. I love this VioLife butter. So far, I definitely prefer it to earth balance and Miyokos— at least with my last three bakes, which have all been cookies. 

I picked this recipe because this was an impulse bake I didn’t want to chill them. I also wanted a super soft, giant cookie. These looked like they’d be super soft and gooey, so I made them. Scaled them out to 6 oz each. Made each ball of dough, nice and tall. I did place them in the freezer for like 20 minutes before baking. I kept them in there until I eventually baked all of them, so some did get more than 20 minutes. I didn’t bother to cover them. I just didn’t feel like it. Baked three cookies at a time on a half sheet.  Used parchment. Not silpat.  I wouldn’t bake four at a time, at this size. These definitely spread quite a bit more than the previous two Levain-style recipes I tried. Not a bad thing. Just a thing. They’re still very good. 

When they bake, I did notice they didn’t spread evenly. That was probably a skill issue, on my part. My approach with these was pretty lax. I probably made them too tall. Or, the fact that some were baked colder than others could have influenced this.  Or, both.  Anyway, If you do bake these, and you notice some uneven spreading, don’t panic. Mine seemed to have turned out just fine, despite this 🤷‍♀️. You can see in slide three what I mean by that uneven spread. You can see the bottommost “layer” is more done. 

🍌 🍞 : 

The first recipe is from:  https://rainbowplantlife.com/best-easy-vegan-banana-bread/#wprm-recipe-container-5565 

^^^ This was for the banana bread with the streusel on top. I added the streusel, but it wasn’t called for.  I just googled “vegan streusel recipe.”  Usually it’s 2tbsp of cold butter, 5-6tbsp of flour, and 4-5tbsp of sugar. Some add cinnamon, too. Like 1/4tsp. 

The darker banana bread is from Hummusapien:  https://www.hummusapien.com/vegan-banana-bread/#tasty-recipes-23066-jump-target

^^^ I gave it a sugary crust by added Demerara sugar prior to baking. I did an even coating; fairly liberal with the application. I highly recommend doing this. I always do this, or streusel, when it comes to banana bread. A sugar crust is such an easy way to elevate banana bread and it takes less than a minute. It looks lovely on its own, but it looks extra nice when paired with a halved banana as garnish. I would have added the halved banana, but I ran out of bananas :/  

Both banana breads were well-liked and enjoyed, but the Rainbow Plant Life banana bread was the favorite.  It was all gone before I could get pictures of the inside. 

I baked these both in a 6x3-inch, round Fat Daddio’s (my favorite) cake pan lined with parchment paper, on all sides.  My loaf pan is no longer alive and well, otherwise I would have just used that (RIP). The Rainbow Plant Life bread rose quite a bit. I was surprised, actually. That ended up being fine because I lined the pan with parchment paper that went at least an inch above the pan.  Might have been closer to two inches. Just be aware of that, if you do use something other than the size pan that was called for. The Hummusapien didn’t rise as much, so you can be more reckless. This was my experience, at least. 

Yes, I am also the person who cut the slices.  Yes, I am aware that I did not do a good job 😂.

VeganBaking,"I tried to make soft pretzels twice tonight, and both batches failed in the same way. I tried two different recipes, so I would love to know if anyone has any ideas as to why I failed so hard.
Both times my dough would not come together when I was kneading. While attempting the first batch, I tried to add water one tsp at a time, but the dough wouldn't take it- as in it stayed rough and ended up with a puddle underneath it. I gave up on the first batch and started round 2.  
The second time the dough came together a tiny bit better, but even after 15 minutes of kneading it was still very stiff and very rough. I set it aside for proofing for an hour and 20 minutes, and it grew a tiny bit, but not much. I attempted to roll the dough into snakes to twist, and upon rolling it has more or less the texture of washed wheat seitan and absolutely no stretch.

 My activated yeast was nice and frothy when I added the flour, but I have considered that I killed it at some point. 
My flour was a store brand, which I know isn't great, but I'd baked from it several times before with no issues. 

Any ideas?

Hope you are having a good weekend. I want to veganize this devil's food cake with peppermint meringue frosting (not sure if it's OK to link here). I think there are vegan recipes for the cake, chocolate ganache, and maybe an aquafaba version of the meringue. There is also a vanilla cream filling though, and I was wondering if any of you had tips on how to veganize it. Here are the ingredients and original text:

>White Chocolate Cream  
>  
>12 ounces high-quality white chocolate (such as Lindt or Perugina), finely chopped  
>  
>3 cups chilled heavy whipping cream, divided  
>  
>1 1/2 teaspoons pure peppermint extract  
>  
>Place white chocolate in large heatproof bowl. Bring 1 cup cream to  simmer in saucepan. Pour hot cream over white chocolate. Let stand 1  minute; whisk until smooth. Whisk in extract. Cover; chill until mixture  thickens and is cold, at least 4 hours. DO AHEAD Can be made 1 day  ahead. Chill.  
>  
>Add  2 cups chilled cream to white chocolate cream and beat until smooth and  peaks form. DO AHEAD Can be made 3 hours ahead. Cover and chill.  Rewhisk to thicken, if necessary, before using.

Would coconut cream work for the heavy whipping cream, and then I could buy some vegan white chocolate? What do you think?

I am a huge baker and bake for lots of people around this time of year. My vet's office always enjoys everything I bring, but they have a new Doctor who is vegan and I want to make sure he feels included when I drop off goodies.

Which baking chocolate bars are safe? I used google but most of the results are all over the place or lead me to chips. I really need the bars and I really want to make sure they are vegan but still taste good.

Any help would be amazing!

Also  is one brand of egg substitute that is better than the others?

Thanks so much!

VeganBaking,"Hi there, I’m a vegan of 7 years and I’m turning 25 at the end of the month and I want to order a custom cake from a vegan bakery but there’s so many flavour possibilities I can’t decide. Funfetti is always a classic and I do love it but I also love lemon and raspberry flavoured things so it’s tough

#1 Funfetti cake with vanilla Swiss meringue buttercream (listed by bakery)

#2 Raspberry white chocolate (vanilla sponge cake with raspberry Swiss meringue buttercream filling and white chocolate ganache) (listed by bakery)

#3 Lemon Funfetti cake with vanilla Swiss meringue buttercream (not Listed by the bakery but thought it would be a nice twist maybe on the classic Funfetti) 

#4 very similar to #3 vanilla funfetti cake with lemon Swiss meringue buttercream 

#5 vanilla cake with key lime and coconut meringue buttercream  (just an idea I had)

I am making tiramisu for christmas, but I am not a coffee drinker, so I always struggle when it comes to getting the coffee flavor right.

Since, as I stated, I rarely drink coffee, I don't have any equipment in the house for making coffee, so I will be using instant coffee powder (not esspresso, as stated in many recipes), since that is what I have on hand.

Can anyone give me any directs of how much water + instant coffee powder I will need to make 250 ml strong coffee?

I am also interested in how much I would need if in the future I can find instant esspresso powder OR if I would make regular strong brewed coffee.

VeganBaking,"I recently witnessed a debate between two chefs regarding egg substitutes in vegan pastries. One of the two chefs was breaking down the egg into its components (water, fat, protein) and suggested creating a homemade substitute containing precisely water, a vegetable oil, lecithin and chickpea flour (because of its high protein content). The idea was that the proteins in the chickpea flour, when cooked, would denature and coagulate in a manner similar to egg proteins, effectively binding the dough in which they are contained. Obviously, if we have to replace 4 grams of egg protein, and we use 4 grams of chickpea flour, we will not have included the same amount of protein (since chickpea flour is not pure protein), and to get to that amount we would have to add a lot of chickpea flour, which would alter the balance of the recipe. The other chef, on the other hand, felt that using chickpea flour made absolutely no sense and that the only sensible substitute for egg was potato protein. Certainly, the first chef agreed that chickpea flour cannot be whipped like egg whites, but in the case of whipped cakes he suggested using baking powder. I wonder then... 

1. Does it really not make sense to use chickpea flour as a substitute in vegan baking? Do legume proteins behave so differently from egg proteins?

2. Is it a quantity issue since the protein in chickpea flour will never be enough? Is it such a big deal in preparations such as shortcrust pastry or custard?

3. Is potato protein that essential both in performing the functions of whole egg and egg white? ?",t2_iyaxjxx8,Egg substitutes in vegan pastry (professional advice required!),0.94,34,1719420805.0,1719420805.0,12,Major_Profit1213,1dp3hj3
VeganBaking,"[Super-Sized, Super-Soft Chocolate Chip Cookies](https://www.kingarthurbaking.com/recipes/supersized-super-soft-chocolate-chip-cookies-recipe). I made the smaller 50g size and they are still huge!

I veganized the recipe by replacing the butter with a mixture of Miyoko’s unsalted butter and soy-free Earth Balance, replacing the eggs with Bob’s Red Mill egg replacer, and replacing the milk with almond milk. (Shout out to Jessica in the KAB reviews who shared her success using almost the exact same vegan ingredients!) I did decrease the salt by 1/4 teaspoon due to some of the vegan butter being salted. Also, I ended up using SIX different kinds of chocolate because somehow I had a lot of partial bags and bars to get through!

They are delicious. Everyone who had them raved about them (except my dairy-eating sister, who prefers the taste of real butter). However, they are a lot of work, and I don’t think I like them as much as my usual chocolate chip cookie recipe, which uses applesauce and results in a much crispier cookie.

VeganBaking,"Followed Claire Saffitz recipe with these modifications:
- subbed califa dairy free cream for heavy cream -> not as good as the silk cream imo, didn't whip quite as well even when using a stand mixer 
- used just egg instead of egg yolk
- used a vegan marshmallow recipe for the topping. this is where I made the most mistakes.

 almost all veg aquafaba marshmallow recipes I saw called for agar agar, which I couldn't find, so I tried to substitute pectin (using 5 tsp pectin where it called for 3 tsp agar). however, I read that pectin shouldnt be heated much past 220F, while the sugar syrup for mallows needs to reach 240F. I tried cooking the pectin to 220 first with 1/2 c each sugar and water, and thought I could stream in the gel after I stream in the sugar syrup - it formed a thick chunk though so then I thought that I could re-melt it into my sugar syrup once it cooled a bit. this kind of worked? but left me with some chunks, so I tried to strain it, which clogged the strainer. then I tried to re-melt the pectin in water and add that (after some additional straining because it was still only partially melted at 220). this also kind of worked?? but I should have just left it as a swiss merigune topping and skipped the thickener because the pectin was a total headache 😭 I also realized that Claire's recipe calls for a total of 2/3 c sugar + 2 tbsp corn syrup, whereas the recipes I found for vegan mallows called for 1.5 c sugar and 1.25 c corn syrup - so mine was way sweeter. I'm worried that the additional sugar is adding some structural support for the vegan mallows but I would still try reducing it next time because it was quite sweet

VeganBaking,"Vegan vanilla cake, vegan buttercream and a fresh strawberry mint compote.

This post is also a follow up to my buttercream nightmare in my previous post.

I had my buttercream “split” and was unable to properly incorporate any food colouring into it. I was able to save it with a few different techniques.

1. I made a single batch of buttercream using tub butter(I know now to never use tub butter for ANY buttercream needs) and it split. I ended up making another batch of buttercream with 50% stick butter and 50% vegetable shortening(this is to help stabilize the high water content of the tub butter) once made I added the split buttercream in small batches and re whipped it. The colour was lighter than I needed so I also added another 3 drops of gel food colouring.

When I was piping the cake I always kept the buttercream in the fridge and only put enough for what I needed in my piping bag to ensure that it was stable, wouldn’t run and wouldn’t split.(The apartment was quite hot)

2. Because I realized I didn’t have enough buttercream I made another single batch of buttercream using 100% stick butter but I also changed the brand of food colouring. Switch to Wilton gel instead of using chef master liquid gel and that worked perfectly

What do you all think?

I got chatGPT to make me a receipe - but I know it can be pretty silly. 

  
This is what it gave me - might be a good starting point - but I could do with some proper direction from an expert here:

Sure, I can help you create a vegan tiger cake recipe that includes vanilla, orange, and chocolate layers to mimic tiger stripes. Here's a detailed recipe to follow:

# Vegan Tiger Cake Recipe

# Ingredients

* For the Cake:
   * 3 cups all-purpose flour
   * 1 ½ cups granulated sugar
   * 2 tsp baking soda
   * ½ tsp salt
   * 1 ¾ cups plant-based milk (almond, soy, or oat milk)
   * 1 cup vegetable oil
   * 2 tsp vanilla extract
   * 2 tbsp apple cider vinegar
   * Zest of 1 orange
   * 2 tbsp cocoa powder (ensure it's vegan)
   * Optional: vegan orange food coloring for a more vibrant orange layer

# Instructions

1. Preheat the Oven and Prepare Pans:
   * Preheat your oven to 350°F (175°C).
   * Grease two 8-inch round cake pans and line them with parchment paper.
2. Make the Base Batter:
   * In a large bowl, whisk together the flour, sugar, baking soda, and salt.
   * In another bowl, mix the plant-based milk, vegetable oil, vanilla extract, and apple cider vinegar.
   * Combine the wet and dry ingredients and mix until just combined. Avoid overmixing.
3. Create Flavored Batters:
   * Divide the batter evenly into three bowls.
   * Leave one bowl plain (this will be your vanilla batter).
   * Add orange zest to the second bowl and orange food coloring if using (for the orange batter).
   * Mix cocoa powder into the third bowl (for the chocolate batter).
4. Layer the Batters:
   * Start by pouring two tablespoons of the vanilla batter into the center of one cake pan.
   * Directly on top of it, pour two tablespoons of the orange batter.
   * Follow with two tablespoons of the chocolate batter.
   * Continue this process, always pouring in the center. The weight of the batter will push it outward and create the tiger stripe effect.
5. Bake the Cake:
   * Bake for 30-35 minutes or until a toothpick inserted in the center comes out clean.
   * Allow the cakes to cool in the pans for 10 minutes, then turn out onto a wire rack to cool completely.
6. Assemble and Frost:
   * Once cooled, you can assemble the layers with your choice of vegan frosting between them. A simple vegan buttercream or chocolate ganache would work well.

# Optional Vegan Frosting

* Vegan Buttercream Frosting:Mix all ingredients until smooth and fluffy, adjusting the milk to get your desired consistency.
   * ½ cup vegan butter, softened
   * 2 cups powdered sugar, sifted
   * 2 tsp vanilla extract
   * 2-4 tbsp plant-based milk

This cake not only looks spectacular with its tiger stripes but also caters to various taste preferences with its vanilla, orange, and chocolate layers. Enjoy baking and celebrating with this special treat!

VeganBaking,"Or is three too many for that to work?

I'd like to take the plunge and veganise a recipe myself for the first time, tonight or tomorrow.

I've got two tins worth of liquid from chickpeas in the fridge, and a somewhat opulent range of plant milks, though almond and oat are the ones that already have opened cartons.

It's a pretty simple loaf cake. I've been making cakes from existing vegan recipes for a couple of years now, including a number of loaf cakes, though I don't bake sweet stuff every week. Last few months I've gone over to exclusively vegan baking.

[https://annajones.co.uk/recipe/chocolate-olive-oil-and-rosemary-loaf](https://annajones.co.uk/recipe/chocolate-olive-oil-and-rosemary-loaf)

Really in the mood for a cake with chocolate chip, but not too chocolatey like brownies, and some interesting other flavours to balance the sweetness. This looked like just what I was after, except the eggs.

If replacing three eggs is too much, I might just get another ready vegan loaf cake recipe that uses oil and put the choc and rosemary in it.

Update: I ended up using flax eggs and it wasn't a great success. Couldn't get it to bake properly all the way through. Though it has been eaten, as it would still have been safe. Next time I try and convert a recipe, it'll be one with 1-2 eggs.

VeganBaking,"i just started diving into some vegan baking recipes last week and i’m super excited about them so far! over the weekend i made mini pumpkin spice muffins and they were so so yummy!! & tonight i made some snickerdoodle blondies — also came out yummy. BUT with both recipes i ran into the issue of the bakes coming out too soft, especially with the blondies. it wasn’t quite as noticeable with the muffins, but more so with the blondies which i was expecting a little more of a cookie consistency out of. the texture of the blondies feel nearly raw, which threw off the flavor experience for me. 

is this typical with vegan baking, for things to come out a lot softer than traditional bakes? are there things i can do/ingredients i can gravitate towards that might help firm up my bakes a bit? 

i’m attaching screenshots of the recipes i used for reference to ingredients! both were baked at 350 degrees — pumpkin muffins went in for about 13 minutes & snickerdoodle blondies were in for 30.

2) Is cornstarch necessary?
3) Classic basque cheesecake needs flour. Should I add into the vegan version too?
4) Should all ingredients be room temperature? Is there any risk in overbeating the mix?

I want to veganize the cream cheese portion, which calls for 70 grams cream cheese, 62 grams powdered sugar, 2 tsp vanilla extract, and 1 egg yolk.

Two questions:

1. What would you substitute for the yolk in the filling? Or do you think I would even need a sub? I imagine that it helps the cheese ""set up"" within the finished cookie.
2. If you have made a similar cheesecake cookie filling, what are the chances that it will just melt into the cookie? I will either have to use the tub Tofutti or tub Violife cream cheese.

Thank you in advance!

Appreciate the tips everyone!

I ended up using Tofutti cream cheese, powdered sugar, and added 2 tsp lemon juice instead of the 2 tsp vanilla. In general, I think vegan cream cheese just needs more tang. I also used the Bob's Red  Mill egg replacer (1.5 tsp to 1 tbsp water) and froze the cream cheese mixture overnight. I think this process was a win overall! I also didn't have enough sugar to roll them in, but frankly I think they're perfectly great without it.

In the NY Times comments section, a reader suggested checking out the [pumpkin cheesecake cookies from Sweet Simple Vegan](https://sweetsimplevegan.com/pumpkin-cheesecake-cookies/). Prop also to Vegan Dollhouse for these [strawberry cheesecake cookies](https://vegandollhouse.com/recipes/strawberry-cheesecake-cookies/). You'll notice that neither cheesecake filling calls for an egg yolk substitute, so it might not be a necessary ingredient after all. I have not cooked either of those recipes but do appreciate them for research.

VeganBaking,"I was hoping someone could help me figure it out. I've tried making scones (dairy free) a couple times and each time they turned out flat. The first time I used cold butter, which I realized is not how you make traditional english scones. The second time I used room temperature butter however I worked in the butter and dry ingredients with my hands and I think I heated up the dough too much. The first time (cold butter), the dough was so dry and hard, and basically cracked as I was trying to roll it out. The second time (warm butter), the dough was soooo wet and soft it was more like batter. I couldn't even roll it out or shape it. I ended up scooping the battery dough with a spoon and plopping it like cookie dough on to the baking sheet. I've read that english scone dough is meant to be wet and that's what makes them fluffier but this was just so wet I couldn't work with it at all. I've also seen people use food processors to create the dough so as to not heat up the butter/dough. I'm going to try again but wanted some help to figure out where I'm going wrong and why they are coming out so flat.

&#x200B;

**UPDATE**: I incorporated some of the suggestions from the comments and used fresh baking powder and fresh self-rising flour. I also used a sharp cookie cutter when cutting out the circles. They still didn't puff up as much as I'd hope they would but they were definitely better! The texture was there, the taste was there, it just didn't rise that much. I used [this recipe](https://www.bbcgoodfood.com/recipes/vegan-scones#commentsFeed) and prepped my ingredients with a scale to get the amounts accurate.

VeganBaking,"I have taken on a challenge of baking for a family member who survived cancer and is now very careful with what she eats so it doesn't come back. She needs gluten free, soy free, dairy free, sugar free which includes, honey, agave, etc., egg free, peanut and cashew free, no carrots or sugary vegetables or fruits or starchy vegetables, no canola oil or palm oil. I need all the tips and suggestions please!

I have been baking gluten free, dairy free and some sugar free (keto) for a while, but have not done any of the other requirements she mentions. I use vegan butter and things like that but I cannot find a good brand of butter free of all the things she can't have.

The main reason I have come on here is for a Spice cake I made for her, [this is the recipe](https://trinakrug.com/keto-spice-cake/) I used and the only recipe I found that used swerve for sugar free and adpated it to fit to her needs, she loves it but to me the texture is awful and have no idea why she loves it, the texture is wet and like mush. I want to improve the texture for her.

I have made it using a 9x9 pan, 9x13, and tried a double layer cake. Pictures below to see the texture. All of the pans I used worked but the texture is just off and I need help trying to improve it. I don't know what else to do, If I need to add anything else as a binder or what. The adaptions I made is: So delicious dairy free unsweetened coconut yogurt instead of eggs, coconut oil instead of butter, and dairy free cream cheese in the icing (removed the butter since I couldn't find a brand for her) The layer cake didn't work with the icing as it was way too soft and was a goopy mess.

I tried this with flaxeggs and it was horrible, so I just stuck with the yogurt and at a loss of how to improve it further. If you have any tips for me that would be greatly appreciated!

Thanks

VeganBaking,"walnut sponge cake with a white coffee buttercream+whipped cream and chocolate ganache

recipe for a removable 10x30 cm cake pan
oven preheated to 180 °C

walnut cake:
150 g flour  
50 g white sugar  
30 g brown sugar  
3 tsp baking powder  
1 pinch of salt  and cinnamon
60 g ground walnuts
3 tbsp vegetable oil  
50 g soy milk  
120 g sparkling water  

mix the dry ingredients, then add the liquids. mix just enough to get a smooth batter with no lumps. pour into the oiled pan and bake for 20 minutes. the top of the pan should reach no higher than the middle rack. let the cake cool before trimming the top.

coffee cream:
200 g soy milk  
25 g cornstarch  
25 g whole coffee beans  
60 g sugar  
1/2 tsp vanilla extract  
100 g vegan butter or shortening (should have at least 70 % fat) 
100 g cold vegan whipping cream + 1 tsp cornstarch  

in a saucepan, heat the soy milk, vanilla, and coffee beans over low heat for 15 minutes, stirring occasionally. the mixture should not boil. let cool then remove the coffee beans.  
add the cornstarch and sugar to the milk and heat again over medium heat to make a custard, stirring constantly. pour into a bowl and cover with stretch film directly touching the surface to prevent a crust from forming. let cool to room temperature. take the margarine out of the fridge (it should be at the same temperature as the custard)
whip the margarine with a handmixer until its creamy and pale. add the custard one spoonful at a time, beating on low speed. the mixture should be fluffy and smooth (thats called a german butter cream!) 

prepare the whipped cream by adding the cold cream to a COLD bowl (glass or stainless steel if possible) and whipping for a few minutes. add the spoon of cornstarch. whip again until the cream holds. gently fold the whipped cream into the buttercream using a spatula.  
spread over the cake base in the pan and chill for 2 hours

ganache:
100 g vegan milk chocolate 
1 tsp vegetable oil  
4 tsp vegan whipping cream  

melt everything in a double boiler and mix well. let cool a few minutes before drizzling over the cake. decorate with walnuts. let set at room temperature before chilling again to keep the ganache from turning cloudy - as you can see on the picture😭

This cookie has been our first go. We swapped grass fed butter for our own vegan butter (found a simple recipe online) and the eggs for equal weight in apple sauce. 

I wasn’t sure if the apple sauce was causing a bit of caving in the centre so we’ll try chia and flax egg just to compare results but pretty happy overall.

* Won't leave me with a partially-used container of something perishable (e.g. aquafaba or pumpkin puree)
* Don't involve decorating/frosting/fussing over the individual cookies - everything's gotta be in the batter!

sponge cake with almond custard cream, caramelized pear, and blackcurrant glaze

[the sponge cake recipe is from here](https://www.zuckerjagdwurst.com/en/recipes/vegan-sponge-cake-so-fluffy-and-easy)

caramelized pear  
150 g pear, peeled and diced  
50 g sugar  
a drizzle of lemon juice  
1 tbsp margarine  

in a bowl, combine the diced pear with the sugar and a drizzle of lemon juice, and give it a quick stir. let sit for 30 minutes until the pears release their juice. heat a small pot over medium heat, then carefully pour in the juice only, and bring to a simmer. reduce the heat to low and let it lightly caramelize. add the margarine and stir until fully incorporated. turn off the heat, add the pear pieces into the caramel, and coat them well. set aside. 

almond cream  
250 g almond milk  
20 g cornstarch  
40 g sugar  (could use more!) 
1 tsp vanilla sugar  
100 g room temperature margarine  
2 tbsp white almond butter  

make the custard by combining the almond milk, sugar, and cornstarch over low heat, stirring continuously until the mixture thickens. transfer to a bowl and cover with plastic wrap pressed directly onto the surface to prevent a skin from forming. let cool to room temperature.  
whip the margarine and almond butter until pale and fluffy. add the custard, one spoonful at a time, thoroughly mixing between each addition until all the custard is incorporated.  

blackcurrant glaze  
1 cup / 200 g blackcurrants  
40 g sugar  
1/2 tsp agar agar  
white almond butter for decoration  

blend the blackcurrants and sugar into a smooth puree. strain the puree into a pot to remove the seeds, then whisk in the agar. bring to a simmer, then turn off the heat. for glazing, ensure the mixture stays slightly above 40 °C; if it gets too cool, it could set immediately.  

spread half of the almond cream over the first sponge cake, layer with the caramelized pear, add the other sponge and spread the remaining almond cream on top. pour the blackcurrant glaze over the cream.  drizzle some white almond butter across the glaze and use a toothpick to create cute patterns. garnish with fresh blackcurrants and blanched almonds. chill the cake for at least 2 hours before serving.

Hi all!

I have been trying to make croissants for the last few years. The first time I made them, the dough rose and proofed as expected but I wasn't experienced in laminating or handling the dough so I had a lot of shaping issues and tearing of the dough. Every single time I have made them after, they have been yummy but dense and small. The dough won't rise at all... I have tried activating the yeast first, using different types and brands of yeast, using bread flour, using different vegan butter brands, doing an initial proof of the dough (still won't really rise much), proofing the shaped croissants extra long... and nothing has worked. I'm wondering if you all see anything in the recipe that could indicate potential issues for less experienced bakers lol or if you have any suggestions?


I was also told that plant based butter creates less steam than dairy butter and that's why there isn't as much of a rise in the oven so I was thinking of trying to bake them covered at first like I do with sourdough bread. Anyway, I would much appreciate your thoughts!!


This is the recipe I used:

VeganBaking,"Hi, I have my own (relatively new) vegan bakery business and I have been asked if I would make some cupcakes for an animal sanctuary to raise money for them ❤️ BUT the customer who wants these cakes has let me know that it's a near 6 hours drive away!

Now I often use 1:1 shortening to vegan butter ratio when doing custom cakes with a lot of detailed piping. I also know that cupcakes are slightly less risk in the fact that if they melt a tad it's not as noticeable.. but obviously I want them to still be in good condition when she gets to the sanctuary. I just have a feeling that even with a high shortening buttercream and the AC on in the car, there's a high risk of the cupcakes looking pretty terrible by the time she gets there. Six hours is a lot :/ 

Open to any suggestions, do you think it's worth the risk or should I just say I can't do it?

VeganBaking,"*the B(acon) is not from scratch—it’s [Mrs. Goldfarb’s Unreal Deli Bacon](https://unrealdeli.com) and it rules. 

She’s been teaching herself to bake bread for about a month and this week she decided to tackle sourdough. It’s been a rough and messy process—lots of trial and error. My kitchen has looked like a series of cocaine bombs have been detonated inside for days. But then today I’m at work, and out of the blue, I get a text that just says, “Nailed it.” Knew exactly what she meant and I was stttttoked. 🤤

So we ended up having vegan BLTs for dinner (see strangely cropped photo) which is basically my default order if I see one on a menu. I took a bite, and it was legitimately the best BLT I’ve ever had. Not exaggerating here—just a solid sandwich, done perfectly. Perfect ingredients, perfect ratios. And the bread was for sure the main attraction. I almost teared up. 

She’d never post this herself and doesn’t like to brag, but I have no such qualms and I’m super proud of her. She wasn’t even vegan when we started dating (just me) and now she’s a gourmet vegan chef 🥦👩‍🍳!

VeganBaking,"TL;DR: how do I make it not fall apart? MIL blamed it on the flax eggs not binding it enough. Should I add another tablespoon?

Hello! So for my daughter’s birthday a few months ago, I used a boxed mix and added flax egg. The cake was DELICIOUS and so unbelievably moist. All the guests were blown away. The problem was, it was falling apart as we were plating and frosting it, and then as we were serving it. No one complained except my omni MIL who used to bake cakes for money. I was breaking all the rules for baking by not using eggs. Now it’s my husband’s birthday and I want to try again.

Last time, I used the 1:1 ratio for flax eggs. Should I add more? Reduce or add any other ingredient? Bake it for longer?

VeganBaking,"nussecke is a german shortcut pastry topped with apricot jam, caramelized hazelnuts and coated with chocolate

for a 22x30 cm rectangular pan
oven preheated to 180 °C, middle rack

shortcrust pastry:
100 g room temperature margarine or shortening (at least 75 % fat) 
80 g white or brown sugar (i use both) 
240 g wheat or spelt flour
20 g roasted soybean flour (can be found in some asian supermarkets, optional but gives an heavenly toasty flavor) 
70 g plant based milk
1 tsp vanilla extract
1 tsp baking powder
1/4 tsp salt
+ 4 tbsp apricot jam for later
cream the margarine with the sugar and vanilla, using a spatula. gradually add the milk—the mixture won’t be fully smooth, but that’s fine. 
add the remaining dry ingredients and knead to form a smooth, soft dough that isn’t sticky; add a little flour if necessary
press the dough into the oiled pan and flatten it evenly. you can also shape it directly on a baking sheet without a pan, trimming the edges afterward
spread the apricot jam, about 100 g, over the dough and prepare the hazelnut topping

caramelized hazelnuts:
65 g margarine
75 g white or brown sugar
2 tbsp liquid (water, rum, or other liquors as you prefer) 
300 g chopped hazelnuts (you can also substitute part of the hazelnuts with walnuts)
1 tsp vanilla extract

in a saucepan, combine margarine, sugar, liquid, and vanilla, melting everything over medium heat until it just begins to boil, reduce heat and let slightly color without fully browning —the oven will take care of this step
add the hazelnuts and stir with a spatula until they’re fully coated in the pre-caramel. the mixture should be moist but not overly sticky (if it's the case carefully add a splash of liquid and stir further). pour immediately over the dough and spread evenly

bake for 30-35 minutes, until the hazelnuts are well caramelized with no more bubbles on the surface. let cool at room temperature for about 20 minutes before cutting into triangles with an oiled knife. 
allow to cool completely before dipping the edges in molten vegan milk chocolate or gianduja (what i used), or dark chocolate if you prefer :) 

150 g chocolate are enough for a batch. 
if using dark chocolate, let it set overnight at room temperature. if using gianduja, it might only harden in the fridge! ",t2_ukaq5wap,Nussecken - shortcut pastry w caramelized hazelnuts 🇩🇪,1.0,378,1730485846.0,1730485846.0,6,yynnss1,1ghcdkk

I used a 1:1 soy milk to coconut oil recipe, added xantham gum, chilled and attempted to whip but couldn't get more than very soft peaks. I went wrong by combining the aquafaba meringue and chocolate mixture before the whipped cream was ready and it hardened in the fridge while I was figuring that out 😐 I'm gonna tweak the whip recipe and make sure that's done before making the rest of the recipe but I am excited because the chocolate mousse recipes I've seen are usually JUST aquafaba and chocolate and not the meringue/whipped cream mix.

Ingredients:

For the lava cakes:
* 100g dark chocolate (70% cocoa, vegan)
* 60g vegan butter, plus extra for greasing
* 50g plain flour
* 30g cocoa powder (preferably dutch-processed)
* 70g caster sugar
* 1/2 teaspoon baking powder
* 1/4 teaspoon salt
* 120ml almond milk (or any plant-based milk)
* 1 teaspoon vanilla extract

For serving:
* 4 scoops of vegan vanilla ice cream
* 50g dark chocolate, melted (for drizzle, optional)

Method:
1. Preheat the oven to 200°C (180°C fan) or gas mark 6. Generously grease 4 ramekins with vegan butter and dust with cocoa powder. Place the ramekins on a baking tray for easier handling.
2. Chop the dark chocolate into small pieces and melt it with the vegan butter in a heatproof bowl set over a saucepan of simmering water. Stir occasionally until smooth and glossy, then remove from heat and allow to cool slightly.
3. In a mixing bowl, sift together the flour, cocoa powder, caster sugar, baking powder, and salt.
4. In a separate bowl, whisk together the almond milk and vanilla extract. Gradually add the wet ingredients to the dry, whisking until a smooth batter forms.
5. Gently fold the melted chocolate mixture into the batter. Take care not to overmix, as you want to maintain a light texture.
6. Spoon the batter evenly into the prepared ramekins, filling them about three-quarters full. Smooth the tops with the back of a spoon.
7. Bake the lava cakes in the preheated oven for 12-15 minutes, or until the edges are firm and slightly pulling away from the ramekins but the centres still appear soft and jiggly.
8. Remove the ramekins from the oven and let them cool for 2-3 minutes. Run a knife around the edges to loosen the cakes, then carefully invert each ramekin onto a serving plate. Tap gently to release the cakes.
9. Drizzle each cake with melted dark chocolate and then top with a scoop of vegan vanilla ice cream. Serve immediately while warm. And of course enjoy!",t2_2t7zs0u,Vegan Chocolate Lava Cakes,1.0,311,1733681815.0,1733681815.0,6,Whiterabbit2000,1h9oz9w

VeganBaking,"[Full recipe available here.](https://www.plantifulpalate.com/post/cheesy-vegan-pie)


Ingredients:

For the Creamy Filling:
- 100g vegan cheese, grated  
- 2 tbsp olive oil  
- 1 large onion, finely chopped  
- 3 cloves garlic, minced  
- 400g potatoes, peeled and diced into small cubes  
- 200ml unsweetened almond milk  
- 100ml vegetable stock  
- 2 tbsp nutritional yeast  
- 1 tsp dried thyme  
- Salt and freshly ground black pepper, to taste

For the Filo Pastry:  
- 10 sheets filo pastry  
- 4 tbsp vegan butter, melted  
- 1 tbsp black sesame seeds  
- 1 tbsp white sesame seeds

Method:

1. Preheat your oven to 180°C. In a large frying pan, heat the olive oil over medium heat. Add the finely chopped onion and sauté for 6-8 minutes until softened and translucent. Stir in the minced garlic and cook for an additional 1-2 minutes until fragrant.

2. Add the diced potatoes to the pan and stir to combine. Pour in the almond milk and vegetable stock, bringing the mixture to a simmer. Cover and cook for 15-20 minutes, or until the potatoes are tender and the liquid has thickened slightly. Stir in the nutritional yeast, grated vegan cheese, dried thyme, salt, and black pepper. Mash some of the potatoes slightly with the back of a spoon to create a creamy texture, while leaving some chunks for added texture.

3. Lightly grease a baking dish. Lay one sheet of filo pastry into the dish, allowing the edges to hang over the sides. Brush with melted vegan butter, then layer another sheet of filo on top, brushing with more butter. Repeat until you have layered 5 sheets of filo.

4. Spoon the creamy potato filling into the baking dish, spreading it evenly. Fold the overhanging filo sheets over the filling, then layer the remaining 5 sheets of filo on top, brushing each layer with melted vegan butter. Tuck in the edges to create a neat finish.

5. Score the top layer of filo with a sharp knife to create squares, being careful not to cut all the way through. Sprinkle the black and white sesame seeds over the top.

6. Bake in the preheated oven for 25-30 minutes, or until the filo pastry is golden and crisp. Allow the pie to cool for a few minutes before cutting and serving.

I made some delicious chocolate chip cookies 🍪😋 

Recipe: https://www.thelittleblogofvegan.com/2021/01/the-best-vegan-chocolate-chip-cookies.html

Thanks u/Sirichstar for the recommendation!

Notes:

* 16 cookies, 172 kcal each.

* I used margarine (and not butter).

* I left the dough in the fridge for about 2h 45min.

* I preheated the oven to 200°C (392°F) instead of 180°C (356°F) because I don't have a convection oven.

* I baked the first batch for 13min (too long), and the second batch  for 13min total, shutting off the oven after 11min, and opening it once after 12min to see how the cookies look.

* Next time I'll only bake 1 row of 4 cookies in the front of the oven so that the bottoms don't get too dark.

VeganBaking,"Hello bakers,

I’m planning on making my own wedding cake from Nora Cooks. My issue is, the wedding is on a Saturday and the venue is 2 hours away. We’re going to be going down Friday morning to set everything up. So that only leaves me with Thursday to make the cake. Im pretty comfortable with baking and don’t have an issue with that, I’m just worried that having the cake done up and in the venue fridge will dry it out? Especially if I had to make it Thursday and make it last till Saturday. I could just bring the icing and the cakes separately and construct it at the venue but I don’t know if I’ll be pulled around a lot. Has anyone dealt with something like this before? Or have any tips on how to keep the cake moist for those two days?

Thank you!!

VeganBaking,"I'm searching for white chocolate chips to use for cookies.  The only ones I can find are Healthy Crunch and Enjoy Life.  They both have terrible reviews, but not too many reviews on the Canadian Amazon, and I can't find them on [Amazon.com](http://Amazon.com) US.  I'm tempted to try the Healthy Crunch though.

I wanted to make my own white chocolate bars and chop them into chunks, from cacao butter, coconut milk powder, powdered sugar, but literally all the recipes mentioned that you have to store them in the fridge or freezer, because they don't stay hard at room temperature, also these recipes added a soft oil to their mixture like shortening or coconut oil, so I'm guessing that's the reason, or maybe because it's not tempered...how do you temper it anyway?  Is it the same as doing it with storebought chocolate?  The only recipe I could find used something called mycryo which doesn't exist anywhere near me, they didn't even have a substitute or a way to do without, so helpful!  I know you can omit the soft oils, but will that work to keep it more solid at room temp?  They say it tastes less ""rich"" with the added oils, I'm guessing they mean less bitter?  I have no idea.  I already have the ingredients on hand but I'm too nervous to attempt it.

Hawaiian sovientry vegan spam and black garlic with scallion muffins 
(With links to Kanaka Maoli Scholar Hiʻilei Julia Kawehipuaakahaopulani Hobart)

🌺200 grams (2 cups) grated zucchini
🌺small kine vegan spam (nah nah nah add one quarter of a can finely diced)
🌺150 grams (1 cup + ⅓ cup)  flour (or almond flour if you are not on AIP nor nut intolerant)
🌺50 grams (¼ cup + 1 Tbsp) corn starch or arrowroot (see notes for substitutions)
🌺entire black garlic head or one entire head of regular line garlic if no can
🌺1small lemon juiced
🌺4 Tablespoons extra virgin olive oil
🌺 1 capful aloha shoyu
🌺1 teaspoon baking soda
🌺Pinch of sea salt




Instructions
 
Preheat oven to 360° F (180° C)


🌺Skin the 2 large zucchini then grate fine. Dice scallions, add black garlic, and shoyu and massage in with finger tips. Squeeze out most the extra water and discard. Add oil. 
🌋In a separate large bowl, mix all the dry ingredients ( flour, baking soda, and salt).
🌋Add grated zucchini mix to the dry ingredients, and finally the vegan spam cause can, and mix with a spoon until well combined. 
🌋As you keep mixing with your spoon, the humidity of the shredded zucchini will allow you to form a dough.
Line or lightly oil a muffin pan (or a a rectangular 4 x 8 inches (10 x 20 cm) baking tin). 🌋Fill each muffin cup with dough, you should get about 6 muffins depending on your pan.


🌋Bake for about 20 minutes for the muffins (or for about 30 minutes for the loaf). To make sure that they are cooked, insert a thin bladed knife into the centre of one the zucchini muffins, the knife should come out clean. And voilà! Wait for them to cool down before removing from the tin. Serve at room temperature.

🌋🌋“With the colonization of Hawaiʻi came the spread of disease, the loss of land that Hawaiians used to grow traditional foods like kalo, and a breakdown of agricultural systems in favor of monocultures.¹ Hawaiʻi’s food scene drastically changed after colonization as land previously devoted to growing food intended for local use was converted to land used to grow food like rice, sugar, and pineapple for exportation.² Innovations in transportation and shipping companies like Matson, which was introduced in Hawaiʻi in 1882, also made it easier to import foods from the Pacific Coast to Hawaiʻi.³ Today, Hawaiʻi imports around 85-90% of its food.⁴”🌋🌋

For those who say why are you MAKING food POLITICAL. Why you talking about how spam not Hawaiian but you make dis about Hawaiian sovereignty???
Food is inherently political especially vegan food. You cannot eat vegan food, and not consider not just vegan food’s impact but all food. Spam became a part of local people’s diet because of imperialism and an economy built on barges. 
🌸🌸🌸🌸🌸🌸🌸🌸🌸🌸🌸🌸🌸🌸
I’m not Native Hawaiian, I’m Japanese Disapora, who’s family worked as sugar cane plantation workers in Hawaii in the late 1800s. 
But you don’t have to be to see that Kanaka Maoli people deserve sovereignty over their land and over their food systems.  
Also veganism isn’t inherently white sooo you no like, dats fine, uwehe, ami, and sliiiide to da left so da rest of da localz can grine vegan food.

VeganBaking,"The typical way to make clotted cream is to do just that with heavy dairy cream. Of course, just about any plant-based cream is going to have a rather different chemical composition than dairy cream, even if some of its properties are similar, and as such other properties will be a bit different. I've used Country Crock Plant Cream to great success before in frosting a Black Forest cake, and I'm wondering now: would it scald and separate effectively enough to make a thick treat for putting upon scones and such? Or would it just turn into a horrid mess, or would it simply do nothing at all?

Update: Upon further research, it seems that Country Crock Plant Cream is designed not to curdle with heat. I'll attempt this with Silk Heavy Whipping Cream instead, and maybe with a few other plant creams/milks, both Devonshire style (as in the title) and kaymak style (boiling and simmering).",t2_jn1sfnxgr,"Theoretically, what would happen if I were to bake Country Crock Plant Cream at 170°F for 8-12 hours?",0.73,5,1729528385.0,1729528385.0,4,st00perduck,1g8u1d3
VeganBaking,"Hi

I have started to experiment with no bake desserts and discovered I actually like them more than the ones that have to go in the oven (easier to prepare and hot weather friendly).

I mostly prefer the ones in layers with creamy things on top (I'll add some examples), but I find that the ingredients for these are crazy expensive, because they rely on an absurd amount of nuts, coconut milk, dates and all.

Since I try to buy as much organic food as I can afford, it is even more expensive, so I normally try to use my ""special ingredients"" like nuts in small doses.

So I am looking for healthy ideas to make these with equally tasty results, but friendly on the budget.

Ideas to replace the cashews (no silken tofu), would also be great.

I only cook/bake whole foods gluten free and only use dates or fresh fruit to sweeten things (so no syrups, sugar, butters, etc.).

I had some succes with making things with a banana/coconut milk base or with peanut butter, but as much as I love peanut butter and bananas, I don't want all my treats tasting the same way.

Thanks!

I ended up using margarine for this batch.  Didn’t have enough vegan butter left.  I also added vanilla paste and lemon extract. Not called for in the recipe. Used Bob’s Red Mill 1:1  and a tiny bit extra salt than called for.

I hadn’t made a pie crust from scratch in well over a decade, tbh was thrilled with how this turned out (though it’s admittedly on the rustic side.)

The crust recipe is from It Doesn’t Taste Like Chicken, and the filling is adapted from My Vegan Kitchen. I swapped pecans for walnuts to replicate a childhood favorite. 

I’d had an inkling that oatmeal could replicate the gooey layer usually achieved by corn syrup & an emulsifier, so I was very excited to find a recipe implementing that idea. It absolutely worked!

Now I don't have shortening, nor do I have time to make a homemade crust before going over to my family's home for Thanksgiving dinner.

Any suggestions for what I can do with my pumpkin pie filling? I do have Graham crackers but that crust wouldn't bake as long as I want the pie filling to bake. 

Also: I live in the country in the middle of nowhere and have no way of getting ingredients like shortening or butter in time.",t2_d4h938zl,SOS! Canadian Thanksgiving and JUST realized I don't have pie crust necessities,0.92,11,1728835378.0,1728835378.0,3,CreamyCashews,1g2sysh

VeganBaking,"briouat are a moroccan pastry made with brick (a type of thin crepe, unlike filo dough it's already cooked) filled with an almond paste, flavored with orange blossom water and mastic, an edible resin. they are deep-fried and coated in syrup (traditionally honey).

recipe  
1 package of brick crepes, around 120 g / 8 sheets (30 cm each)  
200 g peeled almonds  
50 g sugar  
1-2 tbsp orange blossom water  
1/2 tsp mastic, ground in a mortar  
1 pinch cinnamon  
2 tsp flour  
4 tbsp water  
oil for frying  
agave syrup  
toasted sesame seeds or ground almonds/pistachios, i used pistachios because i have so many of them 

cut each brick sheet into 6 strips.  
mix the flour and water to make a liquid, sticky paste. set aside.  
in a mixer, grind the almonds into a fine powder that holds together when pressed between your fingers. the texture should be similar to flour mixed with oil: clumpy but cohesive, forming a dough-like consistency when worked.  
transfer to a bowl and add the sugar, ground mastic, and cinnamon. use your hands or a spatula to work the mixture until it becomes compact and holds together. gradually sprinkle in the orange blossom water while continuing to knead until it forms a dough-like paste.  
form the almond paste into small balls, one for each brick strip.  
place a ball of almond paste at one end of a brick strip and fold into a triangle, continuing to fold until only a small flap remains. brush the flap with the flour-water paste and fold to seal.  
heat vegetable oil in a deep pan over medium heat and fry the briouat in batches until light golden brown, making sure not to overcrowd the pan.  
in a pot, warm the agave syrup over low heat to make it more fluid. dip the fried briouat into the syrup, coating them fully, then set them on a plate. sprinkle with toasted sesame seeds or ground nuts.

i don't know any substitute for mastic, so you can simply leave it out. also im pretty sure the recipe works with filo dough as well! 🤗 ",t2_ukaq5wap,"briouat, a moroccan delicacy 🇲🇦 ",1.0,246,1731605681.0,1731605681.0,3,yynnss1,1graa18

VeganBaking,"first one is with vanilla custard and mixed berries, second with apples, raisins, cinnamon and crushed biscottes (a type of rusk)

strudel dough (for 1 strudel):
150 g flour
1 tbsp sugar
1 pinch of salt 
2 tbsp melted margarine
6-7 tbsp plant-based milk (I used soy)

knead the ingredients into a soft and oily dough. chill in the fridge for 15 minutes, then roll out as thinly as possible using a little flour.

berry version:
i dyed part of the dough with acai powder for a cunty touch. the custard is made from 250 ml alpro vanilla milk, 4 tbsp sugar, and 20 g cornstarch. cook over medium heat, stirring continuously until it thickens to a spreadable consistency. use a frozen berry mix, sweetened with a bit of sugar and lemon juice, and let it sit for half an hour. drain the excess juice before using. spread a thin layer of custard over the rolled-out dough, add the berries, roll it up tightly, and bake at 180 °C for 30 minutes. once cooled, decorate with leftover custard.

apple version:
the apple filling is made from 2 diced medium apples mixed with 4 tbsp sugar, a handful of raisins soaked in lemon juice and water, cinnamon, and some crushed biscottes to absorb the excess moisture during baking. scatter the filling evenly but sparingly over the dough, roll it up, brush with sugar syrup, and bake for 25 minutes (it needs less time than the berry version since it’s less moist). the sugar syrup will help powdered sugar stick to the pastry ✨",t2_ukaq5wap,berry vanilla strudel and apple raisin strudel 🧚🏻‍♂️ ,0.99,170,1730997285.0,1730997285.0,3,yynnss1,1glumos

This is a link to her lion loaf, I couldn’t find the elephant one. 

https://thegreatbritishbakeoff.co.uk/recipes/all/rosie-tomato-basil-lion/

I mostly used her method, but used some ground up black sesame seeds and made a little flavor paste. 

My personal review: the best loaf I have ever made, baked to perfection, but needs MORE SALT! lol. Always… always more salt. 

This was really fun! Very grey. Like Paul said on the show, “I have never had grey bread before!” haha

VeganBaking,"So, I'm vegetarian, & I've been trying to make vegan gummies for the past week or so. I've tried them with agar agar, but I'm not fond of the texture. I've read that you can get a chewy/more traditional gummy texture (though not exactly like regular gummies). And I just bought some. However, I can't find any information about how to substitute carrageenan for agar agar, even though the web has plenty of results for substituting agar agar for carrageenan.   


Whenever I search for recipes for carrageenan gummies, I can only find one.  And It's a recipe meant to be used with a specific product, which is a mix of carrageenan & other ingredients. Most vegan gummy recipes I've seen call for 2 teaspoons of agar agar. How much carrageenan should I use instead? And should I try using both or just the carrageenan?

VeganBaking,"Hey everyone, I'm Jon! I started baking during lockdown and fell in love with the Ingredients and creativity. I moved to a vegan based diet for health reasons but could never find sweets I was able to eat. So I started baking at home and one recipe led to another until it turned into a small business. I can now share what I love doing with so many other people and it is the most rewarding feeling!
Recently I've been competing in 'The Greatest Baker' with Buddy from Cake Boss and it is such an honor, but I need votes from the public to get to each next round.
So please, help a home baker out and take a second to click vote, you can even vote every day! If I win the $10,000 I’ll be the first vegan baker to ever win and l'Il finally be able to launch my business and share my bakes with more people around middle Tennessee and eventually across the country. Thank you for the love and support! - Jon

VeganBaking,"Some days ago I tried making the ""new chocolate muffins"" from ""The vegan baking bible"" cookbook. Based around aquafaba, with a taste of coffee in addition to chocolate. The first try did not work out. Became way too dry. Then it dawned on me that I had made a noob mistake which was so stupid that I'm almost embarrassed to disclose it... I was in a hurry and used icing/powdered sugar instead of regular sugar, without thinking about it. But icing sugar makes a dough much more dry.

Today I followed the recipe properly. And lo and behold - fantastic result! Perfectly moist but not dense, just slightly crispy on the outside, great balance taste-wise between cocoa, sweetness and the hint of coffee. Will definitely make again.

(I need to learn proper food photography though!)

VeganBaking,"My family is from the South, and every holiday season my grandmother makes charlotte from an old family recipie. It was one of my favorite desserts she made before I went vegan, and my family often pairs it with pound cake or pecan pie. For those unfamiliar, it's like a really thick vanilla whipped cream, marvelously creamy and rich. All of the leg work is done with egg, whipping cream, and gelatin to give it it's rich, light texture. 

I've never made a vegan recipe like this, but I figure I could easily replace the gelatin with a vegan version, and the whipping cream with the pre-whipped version of a soy milk/coconut oil whipped cream. The eggs are separated, both the yolks and whites being well beaten before being combined with sugar or whipping cream. Thinking aquafaba for the whites and a mix of silken tofu and yogurt for the yolks.

VeganBaking,"What you'll need

1¼ cups all-purpose flour, plus more for rolling 
¼ teaspoon salt 
1 cup pecans, finely chopped
 ⅓ cup granulated sugar 
1 teaspoon ground cinnamon 
½ cup vegan butter, at room temperature 
½ cup vegan cream cheese, at room temperature

Directions 

1. Line 2 large rimmed baking sheets with parchment paper. In a small bowl, combine the flour and salt. In another small bowl, mix the pecans, sugar, and cinnamon.

2. Using an electric hand mixer in a large bowl or a stand mixer with paddle attachment, beat the butter and cream cheese on medium for about 2 minutes, or until creamy. Reduce the speed to low and slowly add the flour mixture, scraping down the bowl as needed. Turn the dough out onto a sheet of plastic wrap and form into a rectangle. Freeze for 30 minutes.

3. Lightly flour a flat surface and a rolling pin, and gently roll the dough out into a roughly 15-by-12-inch rectangle. Sprinkle the pecan mixture evenly across.

4. Starting from one long side, tightly roll the dough into a log. Brush the last ½ inch of the dough with some water to help the edge stick. Cut in half and transfer both logs to 1 baking sheet. Cover with plastic wrap and freeze for 45 minutes.

5. Preheat the oven to 400°F. Remove 1 log from the freezer and using a serrated knife, cut into ¼-inch-thick rounds. Lay the rounds about ½ inch apart on the remaining prepared baking sheet. Bake for 12 to 14 minutes,
or until lightly browned. Remove from the oven, let cool for 5 minutes,
then transfer to a wire rack to continue cooling. Repeat with the remaining log.

VeganBaking,"Ok, so made some seriously good banana muffins today! Texture was lovely, perfect balance between moist and airy. Nice banana taste with a sweetness that was not overpowering. The vanilla flavored whipped cream on top balanced everything out.

I combined two recipes. The recipe for the muffins was from Karolina Tegelaar's cookbook ""The vegan baking bible"" (the book lives up to its title and is strongly recommended). Recipe is based around aquafaba, banana, oil, flour, sugar and vanilla. Don't want to infringe on her copyright and publish the recipe here, but Rainbow Plant Life also has a recipe which looks good as well, with similar ingredients: [https://rainbowplantlife.com/vegan-banana-muffins/](https://rainbowplantlife.com/vegan-banana-muffins/)

Then as a topping I used a French-style diplomat cream. Diplomat cream is traditionally made by mixing in gelatine and starch to whipped cream, in order to make it more sticky. Last time I put plain whipped cream on muffins, the cream just sort of slid off... so tried out diplomat cream for the first time. Worked perfectly as a topping! I used this recipe from the excellent French blog Perle en sucre, which replaces gelatine with agar-agar: [https://perleensucre.com/creme-diplomate-ou-creme-legere-vegan/](https://perleensucre.com/creme-diplomate-ou-creme-legere-vegan/)

Tried translating the recipe with Firefox, and it worked well... except that ""vanilla pocket"" should be ""vanilla pod""!

I'm doing a final push for getting responses to my dissertation questionnaires. My dissertation is exploring how TV ads affect people's perceptions of vegan alternative foods - i.e., plant-based meat and cheese alternatives. Plus, I want to see if any differences in opinions can be linked back to people's dietary choices, age, and/or gender.

Amazingly, I've gotten over 100 responses for both my questionnaires! All I'm seeking now is a few more responses from vegetarians and meat eaters (and flexitarians if possible), as currently I've gotten a lot more responses from vegans. Obviously, that makes sense I guess, but I'm doing my best to try get the numbers more balanced. 

There are two 10-minute long questionnaires, but doing one is totally an option. They truly are about 10 minutes long, and that time includes watching 4 short ads.
Here are the links to them:
