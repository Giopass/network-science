foodhacks,"So, I'm fairly big into food preservation, ie canning, dehydrating etc. 

For example I'll buy a big bag of garlic, peel and dice it, slap it into a ziplock bag ( spread thin / flat) so it's easy to use in anything we need. Plus it lasts for months if not years.

We buy lots of veggies, but sadly the GF and I work different shifts so we aren't always able to eat the veggies when they're super fresh or before some of them go bad. 

She recently started cutting the veggies up and putting them in glass jars full of water in the fridge. I feel soooo stupid for not thinking of this before! 

They taste super fresh, going on two months now. I've eaten a few of these already, otherwise keep the water topped up. Perfect for a nice cold snack or to make thing easier in the future.

She has also done this with the big bags of lettuce we buy, wash it, dry it very well, place a paper towel at the top and place in fridge. Super fast if you're running behind and want to make a salad for work or home.

foodhacks,"Condensed milk: 4pt powder, 2pt sugar, 1pt hot water, 1/4pt melted butter or margarine

Evaporated milk: 1 part powder, 1.5 parts hot water

Milk milk: 1/4pt powder, 1pt hot water

You can make drink mixes at home like hot chocolate, chai, milk tea, etc.

Plus the process of making it into a powder makes it have much less lactose than regular milk. It's a godsend to someone who usually has to bolt to the bathroom holding their butt 20m after drinking a sip of real milk. Also it comes out creamier than regular milk despite having waaayyyy less fat. It's only $10 on Amazon too. Highly recommend.

foodhacks,"I purchased these strawberries at a Farmers Market. A few weeks ago, I was able to store them well enough to last all week. My method was to soak them for 3-5 minutes in a bath of 6 cups water, 3/4 cup vinegar, wait for them to dry, then lay them on a paper towel, lay a paper towel on top and add another layer of berries, and so on. (Detailed in this video https://youtu.be/PsYlbR0C16U?t=3m9s ) Finally, I place the lid on, and put the container in the fridge.

Lately I've been doing 3 cups water 1 cup vinegar instead because it is easier to remember, and I soak them for more like 5-8 minutes. Because I have such a high volume of strawberries, I pat them dry instead of waiting, and I dump each layer onto the paper towel instead of arranging them perfectly. This time I used ACV instead of white vinegar. I saw that the berries were a little moist, so after I let them sit in the container a few hours, I removed them and repeated the layering with new, dry paper towels.

I don't know if it's because I'm buying them in the summer heat and driving them home in a hot car, or if my vinegar portion is no good, but these berries are holding miserably. I bought these on Saturday and it's only Monday today. What are these moist spots? I've been cutting them off and tossing the okay bits in the freezer, but should I be tossing the berries? It's not mold, is it? Some of the berries look yellow on the inside, but I think they were like that when I bought them.
