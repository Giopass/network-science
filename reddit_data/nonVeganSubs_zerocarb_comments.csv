kzacyqx,t1_kz9t9wv,1c1nw98,"it was an illustration of ""never too old to start""    

 the people at that home had expected what the standard of care brings: they went in needing assisted care and expecting progressive decline and continuing to need ever higher levels of assisted care. .    

but instead, they had  substantial improvements, including some able to leave the home.    

ps: OP being 84, they are likely very familiar with some of her cohort having to go into assisted care, especially if she is in the US, where the disability free life expectancy is 15 years shorter than it is for eg France.  

 OP's age is the average age to go into assisted care,  with about 1/3 of the people in assisted care being younger, between 75 - 84.

Let your body guide you. 

Salt's the other one. It looks like we need it during adaptation. I feel I need it after alcohol but not otherwise

Incidentally I really know I'm on the right track when 

1. I'm feeling great
2. I feel I must spend some energy and do exercise",
m1v9kfi,t1_m1srp4q,1g586uz,"Meat contains all the minerals you need for great health. It contains them in the correct ratio and in a form your body can absorb. Salt was found to be completely unnecessary and people do great without it. Some of the early and most successful carnivores (Stefansson, Donaldson, Stanley) all forbid the use of salt and believed it caused people issues and was, ultimately, unhealthy. Carnivores in the animal kingdom do not consume salt. That's an herbivore trait.

In my experience, it seems like lightly salting food to taste rarely causes issues. Anything beyond that is often a problem. Less is better. Personally, I have gone months without salt, and find that it's really not much different than lightly salting. So, I will lightly salt many foods, for taste. It's not to get access to some elusive electrolytes or minerals from, though.

The problem with excessive amounts of salt is that the kidney end up dumping other electrolytes with the sodium. Combine that with under-eating (which is probably why they feel crappy in the first place) and you're just making the problem worse. Then the solution is to try and manually calculate and consume the right balance of everything. It's messy, complicated, and prone to failure.

It's just so much easier to eat as close to the right proportion from the start. And, that right proportion is very close to what is in muscle meat without added salt to start with.",

ln2uwyc,t3_1fgkkpi,1fgkkpi,"Maybe we are evolved to drink blood too, which has a lot of sodium and electrolytes, which is why I like to salt everything to taste and eat until it tastes boring(cause I could probably water fast for 10 days without no hunger at all, unless my period comes). But if it somehow throws off your electrolites, then maybe you need more of the other electrolytes like magnesium etc. Do you drink tea or coffee or use high-oxalate spices?(Bella drank coffee daily at the time.) Even the substances in unfilteler tap water can bind to electrolytes and reduce their absorption. 

I will probably test quitting salt too to see if it affects energy levels. But don't we just pee excess salt out? I don't mind drinking, eating and peeing more, but for more energy and no excess water retention I would definitely quit it, so i am curious too!",

For sure, without needing to process a lot of carbs, our bodies do need less sodium. However, with lower blood glucose, we also need adequate sodium as it is a primary way we regulate our blood pressure. Myself, I use salt based on how I feel at a meal. Something in my head always tells me if I need to salt or not what I am about to eat. Generally my first meal of the day gets a lot of salt and then maybe no more that day. I do use a lot of salted butter both for cooking as well to garnish my meat so that probably plays a role as well.",

Even small amounts of carb/fibre will stop those from happening and you want actually be adapting to carnivore in any meaningful way.

Keto adaptation can be smoothed somewhat with electrolytes.  
  
Your bowel just has to learn to work without fibre.  It's possible that \*very, very\* small amounts of fibre during the first couple weeks \*may\* help with diarrhoea/constipation that is common, but I'm not sure there's any magic here other then giving your body time.

And the longer term fat adaptation won't happen until you are in stable ketosis for long enough for your body to get efficient at metabolising fat.

My hypothesis was three parts:

* That adding salt sends all of the other electrolytes out of balance, since they need to be finely balanced. It makes no sense that this is a manual process that we need to control with off-the-shelf supplements.
* That people are drinking too much water and flushing out essential electrolytes that they have consumed. Far too many people follow common published literature on water consumption such as ""drink two litres per day"" rather than just drinking to thirst. If you don't add salt and just drink to thirst, you drink a lot less and thus pee a lot less.
* That eating 100% grass-fed meat should have a much better electrolyte profile and balance.

Improvements were: not drinking as much, not sweating as much, not waking in the night to pee, better-formed and less-frequent bowel movements, no sudden desire to drink, better appetite control. My mate thought I'd get cramps and/or palpitations, but I had no such thing.",

luomx5p,t1_lunz0jw,1gg5ka5,"This is incorrect in two major ways. Hormones regulate the utilization of fat stores, independent of food consumption. If the hormone insulin is kept low, fat stores will be in continuous use, making it very hard to store excess. Furthermore, in the absence of dietary carbohydrates, our hunger signaling hormones are fantastic at informing us if when we are hungry or full, making over consumption hard to accomplish. This is not true with sugar, starches, and carbs. Those inputs break our hunger signaling. When you view dietary inputs in terms of their effect on our hormonal processes, you can rid yourself of the very false notion of calorie counting, which is practically useless. One last point to refute your claim. You seem to believe that everything that goes into your digestive tract enters into your body. This is also not true. One example is fat intake. We can only intake a finite amount of fat into our systems independent of how much we consume. This is mediated by the availability of bile. What can't be absorbed due to a physical limitation will be passed. This is another example of the falaciousness of CICO.

Modern meat very likely does *not* have enough iodine. Add to that that bromides are everywhere (they suppress iodine uptake) so we likely need *more* iodine than ever before. Supplementing is cheap and worth some experimentation, IMO.

There are many, like yourself, where they were having trouble at some point with cramps, extreme unquenchable thirst, brain farts, et cetera. Quite a slew of hard to diagnose, sometimes hard to describe symptoms, which appeared to only go away after supplementing x/y/z.

The fact that the symptoms go away while you supplement is great news, and becoming adept at recognizing the different electrolyte issues that invariably come back time and again is impressive.

For me, I feel like this is temporary and finicky solution for an underlying electrolyte imbalance.

I think a better approach is to stop supplementing altogether, and take the time to let your body figure it.

But the caveat to this, is maybe somewhere along the line there's a collection of people who's bodies have adapted to their new eating habits enough to destroy their ability to manage their electrolytes effectively for this way of eating?

But you could further counter this, by saying the human body is very adept at adapting to it's environment, so if you feel the need to supplement at the beginning, maybe it's worth trying to stop supplementing later?

\---

It's a tough topic to approach, because it's extremely hard to test either way.

ku5cmoa,t3_1b9robx,1b9robx,"I don’t know what caused your grief, but in a 10 month period I lost both of my horses, then my husband suddenly died, and my best dog got aggressive cancer. Between the 5 days my husband was in the ICU and the 3 days after he passed, I lost 12 lbs because I had zero appetite. Neighbors brought me tons of food, but due to allergies and sensitivities I couldn’t have eaten it even if I’d been able to keep food down (I did try to eat a few times). After a couple of weeks I finally started feeling a bit hungry, but I wanted to die so I could join my husband. So I went on a bender with food eating and eating and eating…nothing but junk. Quickly regained the weight and then some, as you can imagine. You’re smart to be thinking about this, I wouldn’t stress super hard about being a perfect carnivore maybe stick with low carb so you can keep things around that are easy to prepare. As someone else said, get fresh air as much as you can. I started volunteering at a horse rescue to make myself get out of bed because the dark thoughts when I’d stay in the house came close to winning multiple times. We’re often warned about stress, but it wasn’t anything I thought much about until everything I loved got ripped away and I was left standing in what felt like a wasteland holding a bunch of sticks, trying to figure how to rebuild my life and if I even wanted to. I wound up in the ER twice because they thought I was having a heart attack. I developed all kinds of health issues that all go along with extremely high stress. There are various podcasts that are focused on healing from grief and I found that helpful. If you’re having dark thoughts there are hotlines that can get you help. It’s perfectly ok to take things minute by minute. It’s ok to scream and rage at the universe for your loss. Everyone proceeds through grief in their own way. I’m so sorry you’re going through this. It may seem like it will never get better, but the pain softens over time. It’s been 14 months for me and I finally laugh and smile again, but not a day goes by that I don’t miss my family (my animals are part of my family not just humans). Be kind to yourself and heal at whatever pace feels right for you. Do your best to not spend too much time trying to shut the world out and praying you’ll wake up and find out you had the worst nightmare ever. In other words, don’t let yourself get stuck in the grief. An amazing quote someone shared with me that I keep posted on my fridge is, “grief never ends…but it changes. It’s a passage, not a place to stay. Grief is not a sign of weakness, nor a lack of faith…it is the price of love.” For awhile I truly thought I was cursed or that I’d kicked puppies and kittens in another life, but then I realized that all this horrific pain was because I’d shared and received so much love and made so many amazing memories with my husband, horses, and dog…a cursed person wouldn’t experienced all of that. I truly don’t take a single thing for granted these days and I never, ever assume I have more time to spend with someone etc. I truly live every moment now as though I may not have another. I’m sorry to ramble on, please take care of yourself physically, mentally, and spiritually. 💕",💕

Maybe there's a link between depression and leptin levels. If leptin is high, your probably not going to feel hungry. I would go back to carnivore basics with something like a fatty steak or red meat cooked in something savory like butter or ghee. Salt it well. If you take a bite, and it tastes fantastic, keep eating until it doesn't taste as good anymore. Complete conjecture but you may need something incredibly tasty to elevate your ghrelin signaling to an appropriate level.   


There's also nothing wrong with going through periods of not eating much. I'm 4 years carnivore and I've had times where I've impulsively had the desire to fast for a few days. Lately, the past couple of months, I've been eating breakfast early, skipping lunch and eating dinner early (I normally either eat lunch and an early dinner or just dinner). Our biological needs are not necessarily routine. We definitely don't live in a vacuum. It may not be a big deal unless you find this state of mind and lack of eating your new normal.

l5v8epu,t3_1d1oaoh,1d1oaoh,"This is an interesting line of thinking for me too. The first time I seriously gave carnivore a short was in a horrifically stressful and traumatic part of my life. I found freedom in the very simple ""always knowing what to eat"" aspect of it, and I lost 10lbs in about 5 weeks... 

But then I did some body composition measurements. I'd lost about 18lbs of fat and gained about 8lbs of lean mass. Without so much as a single pushup, squat etc. 

It wasn't just a function of ""getting more protein"" as I'd played that game before doing lifting and swimming in HS and college... Using whey protein to essentially put my daily intake to the maximum absorbable amount by the body. 

So that's my validation of your question and perspective. I would offer a simple explanation to why one should exercise, however, and that is to maximize the functional muscle mass available at all times. As people age the amount of time it takes for the muscle mass to drop after a period of inactivity decreases. That is to say: (I'm making up the numbers here, for illustration purposes) that at age 20 a week of bedrest will lead to a 10% loss in muscle mass, but at age 40 it takes only 5 days, and at age 60 it takes only two days. So the rate of loss even increases with age. (Again I'm not totally sure the actual numbers but this is directionally correct)

An important caveat here would be that all these data are from people on standard diets, so we might expect that, given our shared experience of how easy it is to stay functionally healthy with this way of eating, as carnivore dieters age they not only maintain, and regain, muscle mass easier, but that the rate at which that acceleration occurs is also lower...

That being said we have no evidence to suggest that carnivore is somehow magical and will actually stop that rate of change, and so thus it becomes a question of how much you're willing to gamble, and how much of a reserve you want when the shit hits the fan.",

I had 10,000 steps before I was awake for two hours this morning... Don't get me wrong, walking is awesome and underrated, but it's nowhere close to being as beneficial as an intense cardio workout. 

By the way, cardio is the way to get healthy. Lifting weights will grow your muscles, improve bone density, and will make you stronger, but will have not nearly as much of an effect as high intensity workouts.

So, I am 33f, 27%bf and 78kg. I’m considered overweight but I train 5x a week weight training. I don’t drink, I sleep well. I get sun. 

I have felt that my body has been VERRY inflamed for a while now. I listened to Ken Berry speak about carnivore and I was very interested as he was talking about how people will try this diet and sort of reset their system. Get rid of their chronic inflammation and pre diabetes etc. 

Now, prior to this for the past year I’ve been low carb animal base, so it will be I believe a relatively easy transition. But I’m curious, how do women do on zero carbs? I’m worried of disrupting my hormones in some way? I havnt found the answer yet but I guess I’m worried I will “stress” my body out. 

I’ve been 1700 cal, 159g protein, 59 carbs (berries and sweet potatoes) and the rest fat. I was eating all animal protein, Greek yogurt, cheese, eggs, avo, berries, and butter. I was also eating a square of dark chocolate which had raw sugar. 

I feel like I need to completely stop with all the excess glucose and see how my body responds.

also not known is why the inflammation would contribute to whichever fire was already burning (maybe it contributes everywhere but is felt most in those areas?) whatever it is, I'd have flare-ups of both a skin reaction and GI pain if I ate it. but I was able to have bacon everyday, with no problems.

for blood glucose, here is a trace from a CGM, https://x.com/_eleanorina/status/1735829961938989121?s=46

But some ppl may find their fasting runs higher, Marty Kendall describes it this way:

""This is an area where your mileage may vary.  I have seen some people run at very low carbohydrate levels and end up with progressively higher fasting blood sugars.  Others see their fasting blood sugars continue to come down and ketones go up as they decrease the insulin load of their diet.
When on a lower carbohydrate diet you won’t have high levels of insulin floating around in your system and your body may choose to run blood glucose levels a little bit higher by secreting more glucose from the liver.  This is not really a problem if you feel OK.

Many people find this to be a passing phase and after a time of keeping the insulin load of their diet low see their blood sugars come down.

As you keep the glucose load of your diet low you will ‘dry up the root’ and eventually after glucose stores in the liver are depleted, your fatty liver is resolved and your body fat levels are reduced you just won’t have as much glucose available for your liver to keep pumping into your bloodstream""

kk9iv4z,t3_1aepxhn,1aepxhn,"hi, some people who are lean include milk and cream in their zerocarb carnivore -- it's an animal source food.

For the people who are doing this way of eating to get lean, milk is fattening, even heavy cream can be, it depends on the state of their metabolism

. It is because of the uniquely insulinogenic properties of the milk and the cream.

Someone who doesn't fatten easily wouldn't notice -- just as they would be able to eat breads or pasta, and include fruits and not worry about gaining extra fat around the middle (visceral adipose tissue)

But people who have started to gain excess visceral adipose tissue have more insulin response to those foods (breads, milk, sugar, fruit, starches) and they can reach the point where even heavy cream, full cream stimulates their insulin enough to be a problem. They are also insulin resistant meaning as well as having more of a response, it takes hours longer to return to a near fasting baseline.

for people doing this for health reasons, dairy is frequently a problem. It's one of the common allergeens/intolerances and people should remove it.

In both those cases, butter is fine.

\[There's a tiny proportion doing zerocarb for health reasons who also need to avoid butter -- probably due to an outright allergy as they are responding to the trace amounts of lactose or  the small amount of casein in butter\]

kse2c50,t1_ksdnxgt,1b196fb,"purely on appetite (after transition)

during transition, appetite is low, so it's key to eat enough to avoid being low energy and moody :D

after that, appetite becomes a reliable indicator for most.

(I say most, because there was someone doing this diet for health reasons and she had no appetite, regardless of which diet she ate, so she always had to eat like it was her job, and eat towards goals -- strength gains, energy level. It was hereditary, her dad had the total lack of appetite too)

Appetite signalling is more subtle on zerocarb, in that it is seldom a tummy-rumbling hunger, often it is low mood or energy, as metabolism decreases to accomodate the low intake. With time, people learn how much they need to eat to feel optimal and eat in that way for a while.

The pattern here is quite different -- people usually eat more at the beginning and it gradually becomes less over the years.

The reason for more initially is because at the start, the body is increasing muscle, bone density, and repairing tissues and organs damaged from the see-sawing and high BG and insulin levels and inflammation.

The hormonal signalling from fatty meat only is different, people don't need to be afraid of eating.

Some explanation here of the hormonal signalling and why it matters, [https://www.reddit.com/r/carnivore/wiki/faq/#wiki\_how\_does\_this\_way\_of\_eating\_work.3F](https://www.reddit.com/r/carnivore/wiki/faq/#wiki_how_does_this_way_of_eating_work.3F)

He took the advice and went vegan for quite some time. His symptoms got worse, but he ignored it, thinking he was doing the right thing. He eventually had to remove his large bowel, and had it replaced by a colostomy bag. Around the same time, he discovered the carnivore diet, which ironically, may likely have been the solution to his initial problem, as well as other health problems he had been experiencing.

I don't think high fat diets will be supported by the many, shallow studies that are released these days. At least, not in the near future. I generally prefer to trust science over anecdotes, myself, but I've realized in more recent years that the science community is quite littered with misinformation and shallow/epidemiological studies that are typically presented as facts despite having a history of being debunked, and not actually confirming anything in the first place.

That's not as if to suggest that science is corrupt. There's nothing wrong with science, itself, but people don't have the patience to wait for something to be studied to such an extent that all variables and alternative possibilities can be ruled out, and so there's a high tendency to rely on ""the most likely outcome based on what we know"", rather than confirming something to be true. This is particularly true when it comes to medical science, and we simply don't possess the technology to map out and explore every nook and cranny of a particular field of medical science. Instead, scientists base their evaluations on what they do know, so that we have something to go by, rather than letting people rely on their own judgement. From a certain perspective, it's rational, but it also doesn't necessarily provide any clear cut solutions.",

I am fucking LIVID at my doctors about this.


I struggled with gout for YEARS. The absolute lowest my uric acid ever got on the gout diet and 300mg of allopurinol once a day was something like 7.4.


Now I'm eating more fatty red meat in weight at a single MEAL than I ever did in an ENTIRE WEEK of lean meat on my gout diet. The highest uric acid reading I've had after converting has been 3.6 and that's *without* allopurinol!


My supposed arthritis specialist swears up and down I'm setting myself up for disaster. That it's a ""fluke"" my uric acid lowered after switching to all meat. It's just a ""coincidence"" that the tophii growth on my right big toe has shrunk. It ""just so happens"" that I haven't had a gout attack in over 6 years after getting an attack every 2-3 months on the gout duet and meds. I'm an ""outlier"", an ""oddity"". I'm also a ""liar"" when I've said I've had no attack since converting because some patients want to convince themselves they're getting better so they lie to their doctors.",
m1k0anl,t1_m1jqie3,1hbsr5w,"> you are definitely at risk of that going into your arterial walls.

Yes, you are. But the LDL is not causal in that. It's a passerby that drops in to try and repair the damage present. _It will do that regardless of how much LDL is in your blood_. The only situation it won't go into the arterial walls is when there is no LDL in the blood and in that case, you're dead or dying. The causes for plaque in/on the arterial walls is inflammation, high blood pressure and high glucose (with high insulin being a very strong causal factor for all of that). Dr. Cywes has a couple of videos on that. Ben Bikman too. (and Ken Berry and probably a whole lot of other well known names in these circles)",
m1q6m8k,t1_m1jqie3,1hbsr5w,You’re at risk for that whether LDL is normal or high and diabetic. LDL is part of the body trying to fix the problems caused by high blood sugar and blood pressure. Lower LDL just means the repair takes longer or is less effective.,

With any diet you pick while on your GLP-1, you’ll want to make sure it is sustainable long term. Something that might be worth looking into is Paleo and/or Keto. Zero carb or Carnivore will accelerate weight loss for sure, but it might be too drastic of a change until you’ve spent some time on a lower carb diet for a while. It’s a great way to help support maintenance after you’ve adapted to a low carb lifestyle. 

I was keto for the last 7 years and it helped me so much to keep my weight down, until recently - when I went into menopause - and started gaining visceral fat (the kind that kills you) even though I was still following keto perfectly. So I recently started weight loss injections to help. 

Sorry to say this but you’re not going to get a lot of support here disclosing that you’re taking weight loss injections. Lots of uneducated people & judgement about using a GLP1 already in the comments. It’s sad but people just don’t know what they don’t know. It will take a while for society to truly understand how these injections work to correct something that is not functioning correctly in the brain and body. 

Only you and your doctor can decide if you’re doing the right thing, and don’t let people here make you feel bad about it. You might get more genuine and supportive responses asking in the GLP1 subreddits like Ozempic, semaglutide, etc.  Then come here for meal ideas, etc.",

saving you a click, 

""did you mean to say ""naturist"" or should it have been ""naturalist""?

anyways, they're wrong, carnivore can't fix those problems and you should avoid it with thalassemia minor.

frankly you should fire your naturopath and get another naturopath, this one's insanely wrong, because of the way hepcidin is low with thalassemia. (hepcidin is what controls the absorption of heme-iron, the iron in meat)

what you could try is a low carb ketogenic diet, chicken and eggs, for fish - cod, haddock, yellowfin tuna, halibut (low iron fish) for your protein as well as plant sources of it, and then vegetables high in folate but not in iron. cheese and yogurt are good bc they decrease absorption of iron. avoid anything fortified with iron (like cereals, breads, fortunately eating ketogenic cuts all that out)

it is a low inflammation way of eating, so might be helpful in that regard.
about 85% of your calories come from fat on a ketogenic diet, the protein level is good but on the lower side which helps too. keep the fats from animal sources as that is the body's preferred source, helps with formation of cellular membranes for blood cells and tissues , and the fat doesn't have iron.

all the best finding a better health care provider.""",

Protein is the most important macro in this way to hit a target.   If ketosis is your goal you should find your protein needs and consider that at absolute target not a minimum or a maximum but the goal.  Carbohydrates are always a number we will want to have as an absolute ceiling and fats are the number we fluctuate our goals with while being able to stay in ketosis.  If you’re trying to lose weight, fats will be at a level that will help us reach our goals while maintaining our protein.  If not looking for weight loss, fats are eaten until we are satiated at our goal protein.

you said that 3 hours postprandial you had "" I tested glucose today 3 hours after my meal and it was 9.6mmol/L.""   
that's a sign you need to consult with a doc  
this way of eating has a very low BG reponse, here's an example where you can't even see where the meals are: [https://x.com/\_eleanorina/status/1735829961938989121?s=20](https://x.com/_eleanorina/status/1735829961938989121?s=20)

for people with T2D, on the studies I've seen for zerocarb meals, they will have more of a glucose response, more than the flatline shown above, but lower than for any other food type, and not as high as yours & it returns to a near fasting baseline sooner.

>[https://reddit.com/r/zerocarb/wiki/faq#wiki\_why\_no\_cico.3F](https://reddit.com/r/zerocarb/wiki/faq#wiki_why_no_cico.3F)

Experiment with eating ...

\- at a fattier ratio (85% + fat, about the ratio of ribs or pork belly/lightly cooked thick cut bacon or fatty lamb)

\- and at a leaner ratio (70% fat) about the fattiness of a burger without the rendered fat

how do you feel? focus on mood, energy, appetite, digestive preference.

Usually we recommend 2lbs minimum of fatty meat a day, but you're quite tall, try a minimum of 3lbs / day to get started.

Once you have your meat appetite sorted -- which types you enjoy and feel best on, how fatty  -- then try a feast day where you eat 1.5 more than usual

How do you feel the next day, more energy? Hungry for your meals as usual?

That's a sign you were undereating

If you don't notice much of a difference, or even you're still feeling a bit stuffed from the day before, disinterested in your first meal, that's a sign you don't need that extra.

We don't know why, but some people lean out at the higher fat ketogenic ratio, others at the lower 70% protein ratio (that is pretty lean for zerocarb)

Your body's first priority will be restoring muscle and bone density, recovering from your prior restriction, so you may not lose weight for a while.

Focus on clothing size, energy level, and strength or exercise gains (if you have the energy to do so, you don't need to force it, especially while you're still figuring out your quantities)
