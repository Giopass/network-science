veganfitness,"I‘ve recently noticed that a lot of steroid users are gaining a lot of traction in this sub. I am honestly quite concerned about how much support there is for drug abuse. This is quite odd to me considering that there are a lot of issues that stem from steroid exposure. I‘m actually interested whether people are just not properly clarified about those issues or they just ignore them because „if he‘s buff and vegan it must be good for the movement“

It‘s not really a secret that steroids take years upon years off of your life. If you‘re into bodybuilding, you will have already learned about the countless deaths that came from this lifestyle. 
Steroids take a toll on your body like every other drug. The only difference is that other drugs don’t make you look healthy.

And of course, looking healthy and strong will get you the admiration from a lot of people. However, PED users should be looked down upon. Sharing pictures of unachievable physiques causes so many issues in self worth for all kinds of people who aren‘t clarified about the consequences of this kind of drug abuse. 
Look how many young guys jump on Tren just to be buff. Look how many women have developed eating disorders because beauty standards were forced onto them by beauty influencers and models. 

For those people saying that big physiques are good for vegan activism: why even do drugs to get big? What are the people you influence with steroid physiques expecting from the diet? - Either they come in with unrealistic expectations or they think that building a good physique relies on chemicals. 
The same goes for people that claim to „only take a small dose“. If you could have made it naturally, you would have done it. 

I am not saying that PED users are bad people, but they influence fitness in a very bad way. Stop supporting them and giving them exposure or we will contribute to the stigmatization of drug abuse.

veganfitness,"What’s up? I go by Jarvy or Jarv, I’ve been a vegan for a little over 5 years (March 2019). The transition happened seemingly overnight. When I became a vegan I started my fitness journey. Within 3-4 months I reached my goals! At the time I was running and lifting at a local gym. Then COVID hit, During the 6-7 months that the gyms were closed I picked up my running milage and did calisthenics here and there. 3 or so months into the gym I learned more about bodybuilding, I learned the divisions, I learned certain splits, and some posing. Although I was learning bodybuilding I was still running a lot while lifting. Eventually the running was lowered and I started diving deeper and deeper into bodybuilding. Eventually I learned more about nutrition, posing, bulking, and so forth. Now it’s lead me here! Here are some pictures throughout the years! I’m drug free and I’ve never used PEDS. These pictures are all very spaced out I went through a very big bulk for 19 months and cut then leaned out then maintained but currently I’m cutting and looking forward to competing for the first time this year.

Carnivore: (Either don’t know and assume they get enough because BACON) or say .5 gram per pound (or one of the other RDI’s that’s always debated)

Vegan: That’s a debated recommendation, protein deficiency doesn’t really occur in western countries, hypoproteinemia is only in places were people starve.

*Then its optional for me to be a dick and ask them why they said grams when it’s the amino acid profile that matters. State 3 amino acids that only meat has that lowers life expectancy. 

But my ghost is typing this as I just died from protein deficiency. Or this covid may kill me, no joke. 

Anyway, recovering from extended covid, can’t wait to hit the gym again it’s been about a month almost. 2kg away from being classed as underweight!

The fact of the matter is there is no magic ingredient in meat or dairy that builds muscle more efficiently.

Quite literally the only thing that matters when it comes to musculature is that you're eating enough protein and getting all of the amino acids needed. 

The cool thing is there is a multitude of plant-based sources that are loaded with aminos so you're lacking nothing in terms of what's needed to build muscle. Foods like tofu, tempeh & seitan just to name a few.

veganfitness,"Just a quick heads-up. I've been vegan for 5 years, healthier than ever, and doing DIY weight lifting for 3 years with great results (at least for me) I eat a lot of soy and peanuts and not planning to stop doing it. 100-120g of protein daily, mostly from isolated soy protein, tvp, tofu, gluten, lupini beans, edamame, beans, peanut butter. But 2 months ago I decided to lower salt intake (like 1-2grs per day max) and I started feeling weird, sleep badly, agitated easily and with a strange throat feeling, it appears to be a goiter. I was taking a multivitamin daily that has iodine but apparently it was not a sufficient amount, as I only get it from iodized salt and had the not great idea of reduce it (I don't eat seaweed on my diet) My thyroid blood tests are all normal, but I imagine that if I don't asume enough iodine it could quickly escalate to an hypothyroidism. So, eat your salt, check your thyroid health, eat seaweed, or supplement a low dose of iodine (as an excess can cause problems too) if you are a soy eater, especially if you are a woman (my husband eats exactly the same as me and he is perfect, the only difference is I do more cardio)

Stay healthy on the soy path!

This is not medical advice, but medical/nutricional insights would be great, as doctors tend to ignore iodine deficiency.",t2_3idqnn6w,Watch your iodine if eating tons of soy/peanuts like I do! ,0.96,123,1734516848.0,1734516848.0,63,Bakingdesign,1hgyltg

veganfitness,"Hey y’all. I’ve finally hit my goal weight and realized I def did not build the amount of muscle I wanted underneath. I am pretty toned but I’d really like larger glutes and a tighter waist, so I thought I might bulk up and then cut back down again before next summer.

I’ve never bulked before and am nervous to do it wrong (in the sense that I just gain fat and then lose that same fat again and end up in the same place).

So I guess what I’m asking is: what did you do that worked for you? What did you do that didn’t work? And also macro breakdowns + how often were u lifting/cardio? How much weight should I look to put on?

For reference: I’m about 128lbs, 5’9”, I lift 4-5x a week in an upper and lower body split as well as walk approx 8+ miles daily (I’m a college kid who lives in a big city so it’s my cardio and my transport lol). Calculated, my maintenance is about 2400 cals (mostly cuz of the cardio).

veganfitness,"I read some stuff awhile back and hear random confirmation that ""20% of our diet must be protein"" is a myth and far too much for the average person. Just realized I have a personal anecdote to back it up!

I got a DEXA scan and found I have 34% above healthy min for skeletal muscle mass in males. I also track calories and eat between *10-15% protein* and am below 2g per *lean* weight in kg. Somewhat relatedly bioavailable protein has always been dead center in the healthy range in any bloodwork done.

I'm not wading into the ""getting shredded and hitting max achievable lift"" realm, that's different than healthy and muscular for the 99% of average folks story I'm refuting. Just personally very happy to see how I've lived my life backed up what I felt was BS in our nutritional messaging.


EDIT:

Just cause sources are fun and I looked it up for a reply [Mayo Clinic ends up backing up my anecdotal story](https://www.mayoclinichealthsystem.org/hometown-health/speaking-of-health/are-you-getting-too-much-protein):

- 10 - 35% protein intake is healthy
- Most US men get far too much protein
- Weight lifters or active people should get 1.1-1.5g per kg - I actually hit the lower end of this comfortably
- 2g per kg is excessive intake

I'm neither interested (nor the person) to do a literature review on this, this is just the first result when searching mayo clinic and protein for me.

My only point is fitness isn't just min-maxing your diet for lift gains on bro science, it can be a lot of things.

I’m constantly trying to progressively overload. For a few weeks or a month, I’ll try to increase my rep count. After no progress with rep count, I’ll typically just try to up the weight by 2.5lbs or 5lbs but I can’t get a set of 8 reps in with good quality muscle contraction.

veganfitness,"Hello all! I am trying to get into the gym and into weightlifting, but I have so many questions!! I have tried googling, but I get very overwhelmed with the information. I thought that maybe if I came here y’all could send me in the right direction. So, about me: I am a 37 y/o female. I’m somewhere between 5’3 and 5’4 and my weight has been fluctuating between 230lbs and 245lbs for the past 15 years. All of my blood levels are good and I’ve never been close to being pre-diabetic or having high cholesterol. My issues are that I can feel my weight in my joints and I don’t feel good about myself. It’s time I become the best version of me. My goals: I want to lose weight so that I can get to a healthier weight for my height(I was 150lbs in high school and I remember feeling pretty good there). I don’t want to be in bodybuilder shape, but I would like to build a shelf booty and tone up my thighs. I want to build core strength, and I want to tone up my arms. I’d like to have a mixture of cardio and weightlifting. Also, I am starting from a more sedentary life style with a little bit of activity. 

Here are my questions(please bare with me)
1. How do I figure out how much protein I need to eat in a day?

2. How do I figure out how many calories I should be eating for both weight loss and muscle building?

3. What is a realistic number of days to be in the gym each week for a beginner and how should I split those days(full body each day or breaking up into muscle groups)?

4. Cardio before or after weights?

I have always strived to attain a chiseled muscular body but for most of my fitness journey, my muscle growth has been pretty stagnant. In terms of nutrition, I feel pretty confident. I have a bachelor's in nutrition and I understand the principles of bulking and cutting which I do apply to my diet. When I bulk, I usually try to gain 3-4 pounds a month (~500 cal surplus). My training hasn't always been the best however I've always been consistent. I use to train the standard bro split, then switched to starting strength for 6 months, followed up with more of an upper/lower twice a week. Keep in mind, my strength doesn't really increase throughout these programs. It feels like I'm just spinning my wheels. My current program is periodized, with 10 weeks of a hypertrophy mesocycle followed up by a 5 week high frequency low rep ""strength"" phase. I get most of my training advice from YouTubers like Mike israetel, Jeff nipples and the surf clam. It's too early to tell if my current program will be beneficial but it feels like I have to be 100x more analytical compared to the average gym goer to build half as much muscle.

veganfitness,"I've been into nutrition and fitness for a good 10 years, WFPB (vegan for the animals too) for ~3 years. I lift weights (heavy, 5x/week) and train krav maga and boxing (3x/week). 

One of my krav coaches told me WFPB ""caps"" and it can only be so good. He cited one olympic powerlifter for his source on this statement, that the guy couldn't compete because he was vegan. He also said it's not viable long-term and I can only do this for so long before my body starts breaking down from lacking nutrition for my training.

I'm so sick of this rhetoric. These people claim they understand nutrition, but refuse to see benefits of plant-based for high level fitness training. 

Let's devil's advocate this hypothetical for a second. If it's not viable long-term ([which it is](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/35150294/#:~:text=In%20addition%20to%20health%20benefits,in%20a%20plant%2Dbased%20diet.)), the point is moot regardless. I'm vegan for the animals, so I'm going to make it work. I don't know what that olympic powerlifter was doing, but him performing under expected standards has nothing to do with his diet, if he was balancing it incorrectly, etc. My point is that a omni diet would not be dissected this much. It's only when someone is vegan and they don't *excel* that we're told it's not viable long-term. And either way, I'm not an olympic powerlifter. I'm a hobbyist to be strong, fight-capable, and maybe a bit healthier than your average Joe.

Not that I need to prove anything, but I'm a 5'2"" ~145lb woman. I easily get ~120-130g of protein a day if this is what they're all worried about. This krav coach even said, unprompted, that he can tell I'm bulking well! I've progressively been gaining weight and lifting heavier the past year of heavy lifting.

veganfitness,"Hi all! I frrequently comment in this sub so I wanted to share more about me!
I'm a 23 year old with Autism. On the left I was under 120 lbs at 5'11"" when I was 18 years old. Autism caused me to develop a lot of sensory issues when I was younger, and one of those was food aversion as I hated eating. Starvation was also a way for me to distract myself from my sensory issues throughout middle and high school. I also used physical activity, especially lots of walking, running and jittering, as another means of releasing stress and dealing with my sensory issues. Both of these habits combined led to me becoming extremely malnourished.

I discovered both veganism and fitness at the end of my senior year, and they both re-invigorated a sense of purpose and direction within my life. Veganism made me fall in love with cooking and eating, which helped me actually eat enough. It also gave me a vision through its ethical principles. I was even able to get an ethics minor in veganism at my university! Fitness also helped me overcome my sensory issues as it helped me develop self-confidence through bettering myself over time through hard training.

5 years later, I'm sitting around 141 lbs around the same height. I'm still dealing with all of my bad eating habits from my malnourished self, which led to me developing a really bad eating disorder 2 years ago, but I'm happy about my progress!

For the past 2 years, my training has been predominately calisthenics (bodybuilding and skills focused) and running. Let me know if you have any questions!

Traveling doesn’t have to derail your fitness goals! 
Here are a few simple tips that I use to stay on track while enjoying my trip:

1️⃣ Plan Ahead: Pack healthy snacks like nuts, protein bars, or fruit to avoid impulsive food choices.

2️⃣ Stay Active: Explore your destination on foot, take the stairs, or squeeze in a quick hotel workout.

3️⃣ Hydrate: Bring a reusable water bottle and prioritize drinking water, especially if flying.

4️⃣ Make Balanced Choices: Opt for lean proteins, veggies, and whole grains at meals, but don’t forget to enjoy local treats in moderation.

Remember, progress isn’t about being perfect—it’s about staying consistent, even while having fun! Every step forward counts. 🌟

I’m proud of the progress I’ve made so far but I feel like I’m plateauing. I know the before pic isn’t great but I wanted to emphasize the glute growth 😆 I would love to gain more muscle but I’ve been struggling to gain weight and increase the weight I’m lifting. I started working out 4-5 times a week about a year ago.

I recently downloaded cronometer and am looking for advice on the macros. These are the default targets the app gave me based on my height, weight, and goal to gain more weight (I don’t have an exact number goal). Should I be increasing my protein this much and should I be worried about the amount of fat? I think a lot of it comes from the sunflower seed butter and walnuts I add to my oats. 

Currently I lift 3 times a week (lower body 2x and upper body 1x), then do pilates/yoga/cardio the other 1-2 days. Meals typically include oats or kite hill greek yogurt with fruit and nuts, tofu and veggie stir fry, tempeh with rice or pasta, etc. I love to cook and try new recipes but I am working part time while in grad school so my budget isn’t huge.

veganfitness,"My face when reading comments like this 🤔 Fortunately I love the opportunity to debunk nonsense such as this, shall we begin?☺️🌱💪

1. Wrong, there are a multitude of vegan protein sources that can ensure you have a complete and abundant amino acid profile throughout the day. For example, tofu, tempeh, TVP & so forth are all plant proteins that contain an abundance of amino acids. Meaning everything you need to build muscle / tissue, there's no secret ingredient found in meat / dairy.

2. Incorrect, a plant-based diet is significantly better for your health in a multitude of ways. It's a diet rich in vitamins, minerals & phytonutrients. I know as a vegan I must supplement with B12 but I think that's a fair exchange for removing the cholesterol, carcinogens and cruelty to animals that eating meat and dairy entails.

3. False, soy is completely safe and healthy for everybody. It has even been found to be beneficial for both male & female hormonal health. The only reason one would need to avoid soy is if they have a specific allergy / aversion to it.

veganfitness,"Hey guys,

I am still fairly new to this thread, and really enjoying supportive community. 

So, I want to contribute here as well, as much as possible. I have been reducing my calories from June. I started from 4700 calories and gradually went down to 4200 calories. I lost 16lbs, where most if the weight was fat. I would say, if you have to split fat and muscle by ratio it would be 80/20 respectively. I actually really love how I look now, but I also liked being more bulking. But since I am chasing aesthetics, it makes more sense for me to be leaner.

I put together diet tips on my IG: https://www.instagram.com/p/C567hwnOhqb/?igsh=MXhkN3Y0ZDhpb3I2Mw==

veganfitness,"Fitness isn't just big dudes with ripped physiques or girls with huge glutes in booty shorts. Social media rewards the most extreme looks and therefor creates a warped perception of what fitness is. 

Fitness is a grandma in her 80's keeping herself in shape to protect herself from dangerous falls.

Fitness is someone recovering from anorexia gaining 30 pounds.

Fitness is someone 200 pounds over weight, who used to be 300 pounds over weight, and is consistently working towards a healthy BMI

Fitness is someone climbing or doing yoga or martial arts more for the love of the practice itself than anything else. 

Fitness is light weight cardio athletes putting in their miles. 

Fitness is the disabled or injured putting the work in at physical therapy 

Fitness is a middle aged person just going for slow walks with their dog in the evening a couple times a week. 

Fitness is a busy student putting in 10 minutes a day because thats all they can fit in right now. 

Fitness is your first workout, its the mediocre work outs on the days when no one is watching you. 

Fitness can be small and achievable. Fitness is so much more than just the most Instagramable pics. Fitness is doing what you can, where you are, with what you have. Whatever that looks like for you personally, that's fitness, and I think it should be celebrated. 

I'm not saying the people with amazing physiques need to post less. Please, everyone who already posts, keep it up.

veganfitness,"I’ve been posting in this community lately so figured I would share a bit about my vegan fitness journey!

Started eating more plant-based in 2020. I’m the chef in my household and my partner was vegetarian at the time. During the pandemic, I got tired of cooking two dishes for every meal. My plant-based dishes were so flavorful and satiating and they just felt somehow “good” to eat (physically, ethically, spiritually, etc).

Like many of us, my first concern was “protein” 😱

It’s laughable now considering that I had no idea at the time (like most of our carnivorous cohorts) how much protein a human actually needed, nor was I tracking my protein consumption to begin with.

But after many tens or hundreds of of hours of watching plant-based documentaries (Game Changers was indeed a game changer for me), listening to podcasts/Youtube, and reading books (Tofurky’s founders bio is great) I became more educated and completely sold on my vegan lifestyle.

I’ve always been a fitness enthusiast. I’m my twenties you would find me at some CrossFit gym as I traveled around the Midwest for my sales job. As I rounded thirty, I got away from HIIT and more into yoga. It was easier on the body. I was healthy but didn’t carry a lot of muscle mass.

At the start of 2023 though I made a commitment to start lifting more. I watched countless hours of YouTube videos to learn the basics and made myself get to the gym at least four days a week.

As I made gains I wore them proudly - I wanted to let the people in my life know that a great physique is as achievable eating plants as it is eating meat. It takes hard work and consistency either way, but being vegan doesn’t mean you can’t be in great athletic shape.

End of story.

If you are struggling in your fitness journey, have questions about lifting or nutrition, or just want some encouragement - shoot me a DM. Happy to be a resource for this community!

veganfitness,"This is probably the most involved post I will ever make on this topic 😅. TL; DR: I worked really hard and did it while vegan. I took progress pictures for science.

1 and 6 show some progress pictures from 3 months and 9 months before I started lifting. In the picture from June '22, I weighed about 125 pounds. I was *not* happy and I was always cold (hence the tights)! Currently 165.

Backstory:
33F, vegan since 2011. 6'0. was underweight from 2016 to 2023. Started hypertrophy focused training in February/March of 2023.

I was briefly overweight-obese for a couple years in my late teens as well but when I lost that weight I guess I just kept going for reasons. Realized I needed to do something in 2022 and started really working on my weight in 2023. I had a spotty history with weight training but a long history with basic yoga and a lot of cardio, which I partly attribute to distorted self image related to being tall. Always hated being bigger than other kids. Fast forward many years, I started lifting partly to deal with my mental health and partly to healthily put on weight. Eventually I decided to see just how much I can do and don't plan on stopping any time soon!

I am really proud of myself. Thanks for looking.

veganfitness,"This vegan strong journey really is all about progress, not perfection. It's about making the consistent effort each and every day to do a little bit better. To be a little more conscious of your eating, of your training and your habits. We don't reach our goals by accident, it is the things we do daily on a micro level that will equate to the progress we make on a macro level. 

While on this journey the only person we should compare ourselves to is the person we were yesterday. It's really important to stay in our own lane and not compare our bodies or progress to others, you do not know their struggles nor their story. It's fine to get inspiration from others but always remember that big picture, comparison is the thief of joy. It's beyond important to try and appreciate where you're at on the way to where you're going.

veganfitness,"Hello! I (24F) have been vegan for over 4 years and have been weightlifting for the entire time I have been vegan, so getting my protein in has never been an issue until recently. I have been powerlifting competitively for a year, and in the last few months, I have been having a really hard time making sure I am eating enough, and I just haven’t enjoyed eating at all. Part of it comes from appetite issues (stress and some other health issues that I'm working with a medical professional on), and part of it comes from a lack of ideas and money to be able to have a variety of meals. I was talking to one of my friends who I knew had a similar experience, but her solution was to transition back to being vegetarian/pescatarian.

- Recipe + TikTok I made: https://medium.com/@ali.mizan_76460/tofu-scramble-recipe-01a2b6db3421

Protein shake (304 cal, 42g protein)
- 1 serving chocolate vega sport nutrition protein powder (44g) 
- 1 cup unsweetened soy milk (can use sweetened if you got the extra calories)
- cinnamon
- 10g pbfit
- half cup water to make it thinner

Supplements 
- algae omega 3 capsules 
- iodine drops
- vegan d3 + k2 + zinc
- choline

Side note: sometimes I’ll make a protein shake with a banana and 70g blueberries and no pbfit, if I feel like eating more calories.

veganfitness,"Hello everyone. 

So, after getting diagnosed with a ton of allergies this year, I decided to shop around for vegan protein powder that I could buy to replace my usual whey. I lurked around this subreddit for a while and saw a lot about True Nutrition and decided to try it. 

I ordered three slightly different blends, but they’re all pea protein based and tried them today. 

Now, I’m not much of a picky eater and I will force myself to chug down some less than stellar protein flavors because… whatever, I already bought them and it’s only a few mouthfuls before it’s done and I can move on. That said, the first True Nutrition flavor I tried, Orange Cream, was so utterly disgusting that I was sure I had died and gone to the deepest pit of hell. 

Never have I chucked a full protein shake down the drain while holding back urges to perform an exorcism on the thing. 

I tried cookies and cream next, and it was also terrible but after Orange Cream, it was vaguely passable in a self inflicted torture kind of way. I just tried Brownie and it’s not much better but the heavy cocoa flavor helps to mask the awful. 

Here’s my issue… they all taste like peas, which shouldn’t have been a surprise but the flavor is very overpowering.

Should I maybe stick with Brownie or other strong flavors (any recommendations?) and maybe make the flavoring “heavy” rather than normal?

Or do you recommend a different blend altogether?",t2_pq7b84f5,Pea Protein True Nutrition Blends,0.99,221,1705531365.0,1705531365.0,25,Eana_M,199a484

veganfitness,"I’ve been terrible at following a workout plan recently, so I’ve just started trying to get random exercises in throughout my day. 

Even if I only get several reps of a single exercise in a given day it’s better than not doing anything, which is what ends up happening when I try to commit to a full workout plan that I’m not prepared for. 

It’s been much easier to get in little workouts when I set the bar so low for myself that it’s hard to miss, then once I achieve the little win of just doing a couple reps of something I usually end up doing more than I set out to do in the beginning. 

So maybe next time you’re having trouble committing  to a workout plan, just step back and make your daily fitness goal so small it seems insignificant.

veganfitness,"Chickpea flour, aka “Besan” is super versatile, very nutritious and also high in protein. You can find it at your local international market or Asian grocery store. Here’s a recipe for a super easy chickpea scramble I’ve been digging lately- and some credentials

In a blender add:

2:1 ratio of chickpea flour to water
Garlic powder
Onion powder
Cayenne pepper
Sea salt
Any other seasonings you’d like

In a skillet with olive or avocado oil, add:

Chopped red onion
Chopped bell pepper
Any other veggies your want (I’ve used fresh garlic and fresh ginger) 

Cook veggies for a couple minutes, blend your mixture and pour right into the pan. I like to use a big spoon to scrape the pan and mash it up as it dries/ solidifies. In only a couple minutes you should have something that resembles scrambled eggs. (minus the dead chicken fetus!). I like to top with avocado or green onion.

This recipe is perfect if you are trying to lean bulk using Whole Foods as chickpeas are somewhat high in calories. I also make other recipes with chickpea flour like pancakes, custard/ porridge, falafel etc. Let me know if you’d like me to share those too! Let’s get these gains😼👊💪

veganfitness,"I managed to lose a substantial amount of body in the last months without a serious loss of muscle mass. Most of the time I maintained a caloric deficit of 200-400 kcals. Except the periods I was in vacation where you can see the BF went up. I have a TDEE of about 1400 kcals according to my watch. 

I lost about 10 kg weight and now I will slowly gain some back because of strength training and I want to put in muscle mass. But I knew I need to get down to a certain weight so I don’t get miserable. 

I tracked calories used using a Garmin watch and calories consumed with My Fitness Pal. I weigh myself almost every morning and try not to react over the numbers when I don’t like them. 

I try to get 120 grams of protein using protein shake, TVP, and seitan. I don’t like protein and would ideally only eat white rice and potatoes so getting enough protein is a drag, but I do it nonetheless. 

Added running (up to 4 days a week) from August (except I was out almost whole of November from an aggressive flu). Started strength training in June (I think) following a 3 day free program. But I lack consistency.

I've seen the most progress over the past 3 weeks.

I eat mostly WFPB and gluten-free because of an allergy. I don't count calories except for in my head because I've been doing it since I was 13. One thing that really helped me on this sub is seeing y'all's portion sizes. I was eating SO MUCH before and have probably cut down to about half of what I was eating before, especially carbs.

It is a small one, only 20cm diameter.

Recipe

Chocolate Mousse/Cream:

1. Blend one block of tofu with half the amount of melted chocolate and 2 tablespoons of coconut cream. Add sweetener to taste. Optional: include a pinch of cinnamon or vanilla for extra flavor.

(Example: I used 500g of tofu, this time just 200g of Lindt Dark chocolate (sugar-free), and a small amount of xylitol for sweetness).


Brownie Batter:

1. Mix 2 tablespoons of flaxseed powder with 6 tablespoons of water and let sit to thicken.

2. Blend the thickened flax mixture with one small can of black beans, 85g of cocoa powder, a pinch of salt, vanilla extract, 60g of sweetener (such as xylitol), and 1.5 teaspoons of baking powder until smooth.

If the mixture is too thick, add a little more water as needed. You can also add nuts if you like.

3. Pour the batter into a baking pan (or divide evenly between two smaller pans for two layers) and bake at 180°C (350°F) for about 20 minutes.


Assembly:

1. After the brownie layers have cooled, spread some of the chocolate mousse and a layer of cherries between the two layers.

2. Use the remaining chocolate mousse to cover and decorate the top.

 And through the cut I traveled internationally, had free meals, ate out, enjoyed myself, and wasn’t 100% successful every day but I learned consistency and good habits and I’m so excited to see where the next year and beyond takes me.",t2_2sf7pfbi,My first ever cut!

veganfitness,"Upon further consideration with consoling with you all and taking body fat measurements which sit at 20.9%

I have lost so far a total of 35pounds (16kg) since my weight loss journey started, so maybe this is the end of that journey and time to focus on new goals. 

This is my body after eating and drinking all my food and water for the day. (With not working out)

I am going to try and focus on not so much weight loss anymore as it seemed everyone was highly against. But I truly love the honesty. 

So I would like to focus on toneing my body and make myself stronger. 

Please any tips for strength training and tips for high protein meals that would be incredible.

Reposting to correct typos. 
I’m 57 yo., vegetarian for 38 years and 100% vegan for 7 months. I have been working hard to lose fat and gain strength and seeing results is motivating me to continue on my fitness journey. . .

Not sure if I should continue to lose weight/fat or hold weight steady and focus on gaining muscle/strength. I ultimately want to be fit and strong and not looking to get huge.

Any advice?
Where would you go from here?

More info: 
I work out (progressive strength training) 5-6 days a week and supplement protein intake (100g/day). I am 6’3 and I have lost 32 pounds (from 252 lb down to 220 lb) in 18 weeks and have not been losing weight for last two weeks. I’m not counting, but I have been doing my best to train hard, sleep well, eat WF, and eat less.

veganfitness,"Little bit about myself, been lifting since I was around 15, sometimes more, sometimes less seriously (30 now) and worked as a personal trainer. Started eating plant based 8 years ago due to health reasons (blood pressure), turned vegan pretty quickly afterwards.

So I was around 93kg(205lbs) back then and after switching my diet and doing a lot more cardio I dropped down to around 73kg (160lbs) in about 4-5 months, lost a good amount of muscle and also fat and obviously strength. Got back into lifting, but never really regained most of my strength or size and also didn't feel like it.

Twice a week lifting:

Started doing this a couple years ago simply because I did not want to workout that much anymore, but at first also did this very much on and off. About a year ago I thought I want to take it more seriously and around that time Dr. Pak and Jeff Nippard started doing videos about minimalist training. I did my own plan with the strength part from Dr. Paks program and I put 20kgs on my max squat in 4 months.
From January until the end of July I did the Jeff Nippard essentials twice a week program, solely focused on hypertrophy. I am now a little under 80kg and I built a very good amount of muscle, at least it looks like it.
I just started doing the twice a week variation of 531 in August and really like it so far. Minimalist approach as well, only one + set. Pretty excited to see how this works. Am bulking a bit as well.

What to expect: I was very pleased with my experience. I built muscle and strength fairly well, not as good as when I did more serious training, but let me tell you one thing: fitness is way too often focused on ""optimal"" and what not. Sometimes that just does not work. Doing 2 solid workouts a week will almost certainly get you very good results. So if you are not able to do everything you can, don't worry, you will be fine.

veganfitness,"Had a few people asking what I eat after my last post (yall are so nice an encouraging!) so I thought I’d log meal I eat regularly on MyFitnessPal and let you know :) 

I make this for dinner then split it in half and have half for dinner and half for lunch the next day. The edamame pasta and the tofu are the consistent things - the veggies and seasoning changes a fair bit. Right now my favorite vegetables are mushrooms (not technically a vegetable haha), cabbage, broccolini, kale/spinach, edamame/peas. Other things I rotate in are cauliflower, carrots, sweet corn, sweet peas, green beans, scallions. 

I cut up and fry a whole block of tofu in a wok or deep pan in some chilli oil, add spices and nutritional yeast. Then add sliced mushrooms, sliced cabbage and cook for a few minutes. Add veggies and some water, cook for a few minutes more with the lid on until the veggies soften. Add more nutritional yeast at the end, salt and pepper. While this is happening I cook half a packet of the edamame pasta. The whole thing takes about 10-15 mins. Split the pasta in half and then the bowl of tofu + veggies. Enjoy!

For me for breakfast I’ll have a protein shake (about 150 cals, 25g protein), then again after my workout, then I have these leftovers for lunch and then make it again for dinner. Puts me at about 1900-2000 cals, 180-200g protein a day. I’m currently maintaining.

veganfitness,"Wanted to share this for accountability. Somehow this year mentally was tougher than the others. I always thought I was very strong willed and didnt suffer much from procrastination and somewhat of a food disorder. That’s thrown my whole year into turmoil and gained back 13 pounds. I think now i’m finally in a good place and have started my deficit again. Wanted to share this as an accountability post, I can’t wait till my arms slim down so I can see a toned bicep 😅.

But ya’ll the mental game of things is legit real, from constant self talk every day to get back on track to keep falling off is depleting, even starting to self talk to pick yourself up is depleting in itself. Rehabbing injury after injury. Anyways, just wanted to shout out to those struggling and wish you all the best - keep at it!!

I'm a 38yo, dutchie, vegan for almost 11y and  by no means fit (overweight etc). From 16-19 juli i walked the ""Nijmegse Vierdaagse"", the biggest walking event in te world. I walked 3x40km and 1x 30km. 

I trained a lot beforehand, walking more than 500km and did crossfit 2 times a week. I finished the walk with minimal blisters but sore shins. Now i'm noticing that i'm losing my fitnesslevel. Minimal movement gives me cramping legs, i have no energy and i cannot to my cardio exercises like i used to. So i'm starting to lose confident in my body. I don't know how to turn this around, thinking about how ""fit"" i was before and during the walk. I was so proud of myself and what my body did and i'm losing that stenght and feeling :(

What can i do to get back on track? :) i'm doing crossfit 2 times and after the summerbreak wil start walking again. ",t2_iaxzlveh,Regaining strength/confident back,1.0,91,1722411486.0,1722411486.0,8,miepmans,1egh9re

veganfitness,"A PSA to myself and to anyone whom needs to hear it 💫This journey really is all about progress, not perfection. It's about making the consistent effort each and every day to do a little bit better. To be a little more conscious of your eating, of your training and your habits. We don't reach our goals by accident, it is the things we do daily on a micro level that will equate to the progress we make on a macro level. 

While on this journey the only person we should compare ourselves to is the person we were yesterday. It's really important to stay in our own lane and not compare our bodies or progress to others, you do not know their struggles nor their story. It's fine to get inspiration from others but always remember that big picture, comparison is the thief of joy. It's beyond important to try and appreciate where you're at on the way to where you're going.

Simply to say, trust the process, trust your purpose and take it one day at a time!🌱💪

I’m going through a lot right now… losing people, ending relationships, even saying goodbye to my dog from her sickness. Losing my girlfriend has been incredibly tough too, I’m lacking that emotional stability and honestly, I don’t feel okay most days. Life feels really heavy, and most days, I’m just going through the motions: work, gym, focusing on nutrition. 

But even on the tough days, I’m still trying to show up for myself. My only bad vice is that I smoke way too much weed sometimes. But I know the path forward is one small step at a time, and eating well and keeping healthy routines is my way of pushing through.
