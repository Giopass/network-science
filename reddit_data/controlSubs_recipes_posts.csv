recipes,"I am not a fan of bolognese sauce, but there was one day that I, for some ungodly reason, saw the picture of a pappardelle alla bolognese in the NYT website, and I realized I just HAD to make it! And it truly is one of the best things I've ever cooked, and that's only using very common ingredients! It's a recipes that explores how much you can do, how much flavor you can extract from things we consider 'simple'.

Ingredients (for about 3 - 5 servings):

• 1tbs of extra virgin olive oil (if you have EVOO with truffles it's even better!)
• 2tbs of butter
• 1 white onion
• 1 carrot
• 1 cup of celery
• 450g / 1 pound of minced meat (I used 200g of ground pork to 250g of ground beef)
• 1 cup / 240ml of milk
• 1 cup / 240ml of dry white wine
• 1 and 1/2 cup of canned tomato (basically one can)
• Peels of sicilian lemon
• Black pepper 
• Salt
• Lots of water
• Freshly grated cheese (parmesan or grana padano)

Preparation method:

• Place the olive oil and the butter in a pan and wait for them to melt and heat up.

• Add the chopped onion in a pot and turn on medium heat. Cook and stir the onion until it becomes translucent, then add the chopped celery and carrot. Season them with salt and pepper. Cook for about 2 minutes, stirring the vegetables to coat them well.

• Add the ground meat, a generous pinch of salt, and pepper. Break up the meat with a fork, stir well, and cook until the meat loses its raw red color.

• Add the milk and let it simmer gently, stirring constantly, until it has completely bubbled away.Add the peeled lemon zests, and stir.

• Add the wine, let it boil until evaporated completely (it will take about 20 to 30 minutes). Taste it and season it as needed.

• Add the tomatoes and stir well to coat all the ingredients. Taste it and season as needed.

• When the tomatoes start bubbling, reduce the heat as much as possible to let the sauce cook slowly, with only an intermittent bubble rising to the surface.

 • Cook, uncovered, for 3 hours or more (6 hours for maximum flavor), stirring occasionally. Check it every 20-30 minutes. As the sauce cooks, you will likely notice it starting to dry out and the fat separating from the meat. To prevent sticking, add ½ cup of water whenever necessary.

• In the end, however, there should be no water left, and the fat should separate from the sauce. Stir to mix the fat into the sauce, taste, and season it.

• Add a ladle of the pasta cooking water if you want it to be more saucy. Add the cooked pasta into the bolognese pot and mix it so the sauce completely coats the pasta. 

• Serve with grated cheese and enjoy the best bolognese ever!",Pappardelle Alla Bolognese,t2_1cuabttf,0.99,606,1727958835.0,1727958835.0,41,Lipe18090,1fv6m8g

Pan-Seared Duck Breast with Carrot Puree, Long Stem Broccoli, Thousand-Layer Potatoes, and Honey Mustard Sauce

Ingredients

For the Duck Breast and Honey Mustard Sauce:

	•	2 duck breasts, skin scored
	•	Salt and pepper to taste
	•	2 tbsp Dijon mustard
	•	2 tbsp honey
	•	50 ml chicken stock

For the Carrot Puree:

	•	300g carrots, peeled and sliced
	•	200 ml vegetable stock or water (to boil carrots)
	•	30 ml heavy cream
	•	1 small pinch of nutmeg (optional)
	•	Salt and pepper to taste

For the Thousand-Layer Potatoes:

	•	500g red potatoes, peeled and thinly sliced
	•	100 ml melted goose fat (or duck fat)
	•	Salt to taste
	•	Small baking pan (approximately 15cm x 15cm)

For the Long Stem Broccoli:

	•	200g long-stem broccoli
	•	Olive oil for drizzling
	•	Salt and pepper to taste

Preparation Steps

1. Prepare the Thousand-Layer Potatoes (the day before):

	•	Preheat oven to 135°C (275°F).
	•	Layer the sliced potatoes in a baking pan, brushing each layer with goose fat and lightly salting.
	•	Cover with foil and bake for 2.5 hours until tender.
	•	Once out of the oven, place another pan on top and weigh it down to press the potatoes.
	•	Refrigerate overnight to set. On the day of serving, cut into 2 large rectangular pieces for each plate.

2. Prepare the Carrot Puree:

	•	Boil carrots in stock or water until tender (about 15 minutes).
	•	Drain and transfer carrots to a blender, adding cream and seasoning with salt, pepper, and a pinch of nutmeg.
	•	Blend until smooth, adjusting seasoning if necessary. Set aside and reheat gently before serving.

3. Sear the Duck Breast:

	•	Pat the duck breasts dry, score the skin, and season with salt and pepper.
	•	Heat a pan over medium heat. Place duck breasts skin-side down, allowing the fat to render and skin to crisp (about 6-8 minutes).
	•	Flip and cook for an additional 3-4 minutes, or until desired doneness.
	•	Rest duck for 5 minutes before slicing.

4. Make the Honey Mustard Sauce:

	•	Remove any excess fat from the duck pan, leaving about 1 tbsp.
	•	Add Dijon mustard, honey, and chicken stock, simmering gently until thickened. Adjust seasoning to taste.

5. Cook the Long Stem Broccoli:

	•	Blanch broccoli in boiling water for 2-3 minutes until tender-crisp. Drain and drizzle lightly with olive oil, seasoning with salt and pepper.

6. Finish the Thousand-Layer Potatoes:

	•	Cut the chilled potato block into serving-sized rectangles.
	•	Pan-fry in a little goose fat over medium-high heat until golden and crispy on each side.

Plating

	1.	Place a portion of carrot puree on each plate, spreading gently.
	2.	Arrange sliced duck breast atop the puree.
	3.	Add the crispy thousand-layer potato piece alongside the duck.
	4.	Place the broccoli next to the other elements.
	5.	Drizzle honey mustard sauce over the duck and serve immediately.
