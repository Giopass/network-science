kv47acr,t3_1bfjyi4,1bfjyi4,"That‚Äôs awesome. Myself 4 weeks strict carnivore and now adding eggs and fish. Tired first 3 days, then an insane energy boost. That disappeared after a week and had on and off days. Taking care of the right supplements electrolytes for me, now back on track. Needed 8 hours of sleep before and still tired after waking up, now after 4 hours I‚Äôm sharp as a knife and keep going for rest of the day. Bodyfat to 9%, shredded as a mf. Kept my training on point with discipline even though some days was so tired (2/3 times a week). This is the key guys, experiencing any difficulty in life mentally or physically‚Äî> be strong and do strict carnivore for 1 month then see how you feel",

kv1a79u,t3_1bfjyi4,1bfjyi4,"Your numbers are so similar it‚Äôs scary. I started at 306.6 although I began on January 8th and I‚Äôm down about 43lbs since!

My A1C was out of control and very high and it went down to 6 after a month (tested in February). I can‚Äôt wait to see what it‚Äôs like in May once 3 months pass since the last test. 

Interestingly my liven enzymes normalized after just one month while both AST and ALT were high due to my fatty liver prior. Crazy considering how much fat I‚Äôm eating.

Started eating only beef as an elimination diet due to Histamine Intolerance.....I didn't even know Carnivore was a thing.  Three months in and I am down to 288 and feeling MUCH better.  I have been taking blood tests every 3 months for a couple years as they try to fix the LC.....After 2 months of Meat/Fish only diet blood tests showed lowered Cholesterol, Inflammation, and Glucose....Even cleared up my liver function......The doctor that wanted to put me on 3-4 New meds won't return my calls after she read my blood tests and I told her how I got there.",

- bacon and eggs with hamburger patties
- ground beef with fried eggs
- a tin of sardines 2-3x a week
- bone broth 3x a week
- 5% Greek yogurt when I want a little something something. Usually my dessert on game night with friends each week. Not more than once a week.

kvjj0wp,t1_kvegjiw,1bfjyi4,"YES! Well more keto than carnivore but a book called Diabetes Solution by Dr. Richard K. Bernstein literally changed our lives (T1D diagnosis 15 months ago). He is a T1D himself and a huge advocate for low carb, high protein, and normal blood sugars. He has a YouTube series called Diabetes University. Also Facebook groups like typeonegrit and letmebe83 have been very helpful.¬†
We primarily use R insulin now to match the slower BG rise from protein/fat, and basal is probably half of what it was at diagnosis. God bless!¬†",
lbhpnsn,t1_lasaiag,1bfjyi4,"Thank you for asking!

As of July 3, 2024, I am at 277. My blood sugars remain at a consistent 105 average. My skin is clear, and I have gained enough energy to begin a daily calisthenics workout.

I had a setback regarding my heart. I received steroids in April for a respiratory infection. They wreaked havoc on my body. My blood sugars went ape crazy - over 287 the first day! The course also caused my heart to go into AFib. The first episode lasted over 4 days.

A long story short, I had an ablation procedure in early June. My recovery has been steady and solid. I continue to eat carnivore. I am certain if I was not doing so, my life would be vastly different right now. My body is recovering. One benefit of the surgery is that my bloodwork confirms my trend towards health. My cholesterol, my blood sugar, etc. all show a healthy baseline. First time in a decade.

Of course, I wish I had lost more weight, but I'm optimistic. I am getting stronger and healthier, bit by bit. While not as fast as I prefer, it's in the right direction!",
kv768l0,t1_kv1kuwv,1bfjyi4,Had a friend who is a nurse tell me to be careful cause saturated fats will kill you. I sent her a link to a study affirming the heart‚Äôs preference for long chain fatty acids as fuel. Silence.,

kvcaicl,t1_kv2tycs,1bfjyi4,Why only eat once a day? Would 3-4 times be too much on this type of diet?,
kv73glo,t1_kv5jh53,1bfjyi4,Well that‚Äôs great man. I‚Äôm glad you survived your heart attack and I‚Äôm very happy to learn your cardiologist and GP are supportive of a real heart healthy diet.,

lbli9m3,t1_lbhpnsn,1bfjyi4,"while recovering, there is a mild, productive state of insulin resistance --- itpart of how the body restores and repairs tissues. while that is ongoing, there will be less or no net lipolysis (drawing down from your fat stores)¬†

sorry about your respiratory infection üò£ but glad you got the care you did (is it too much to say it sounds like it was lifesaving! üôÇ) and be patient about weight loss, there's a lot going on right now with your healing.¬†

one benefit, since you say you have the energy to return to calisthenics, the mild IR (insulin resistance) within the context of the low and stable BG and insulin of carnivore, can help with increasing muscle, repairing muscle tissue after lifting. focus on how you feel, your energy levels, and your exercise/strength gains rather than the scale :)¬†",üò£üôÇ

lodhc6e,t3_1fmqti3,1fmqti3,"Common believe is that carbs are a must. I‚Äôm tired of it. Yesterday I participated in a bike race, 140km and 3500m elevation gain, totally fasted, just water and salts. It took 6h and all my other friends all loaded carbs night before, the carbs all time during the race and then the after race carbs meal to recover, because carbs are essential for recovery ü§£ü§£ü§£

I just keep silence and do my job, eat meat. It is impossible to debate on it. And I‚Äôm sure if you are not a fat burner, you need all that carbs, but being fat adapted is just the best approach to endurance",ü§£ü§£ü§£
locr6oq,t3_1fmqti3,1fmqti3,"Loved hearing about this when you did the podcast rounds. It‚Äôs really impressive. The criticism most often levelled, however is that zero carbers lack power for sprint work. I am happy doing long (30+ mile) bike rides fasted on my own, but I can appreciably fade on group rides when everyone else is smashing gels!",
lod321w,t3_1fmqti3,1fmqti3,"When do I get this energy skyrocket effect, you think?

Edit: still waiting, probably doing another fasted marathon before he replies",
lod09iv,t3_1fmqti3,1fmqti3,Nice!  Kudos to you. I‚Äôve done 22 mile hikes/rucks fasted with more in the tank. That‚Äôs around 8 hours. Only thing slowing me down is my feet. They get sore after that long.,

m7nstv2,t3_1fmqti3,1fmqti3,I too ran a marathon on Carnivore. Felt good. I love the discipline and mental fortitude it taught me.,
loggywy,t3_1fmqti3,1fmqti3,"It‚Äôs not that carnivore is inferior to carbs, it definitely is better, it‚Äôs just nearly impossible for a regular person to stay away from carbs completely, unless you have iron will and want to miss out on 90% of culinary and beverage endeavors.",
loef4r7,t1_lodhc6e,1fmqti3,"How long does it take to get fat adapted? Do you usually eat more the day before a race? After a failed attempt at carnivore, I'm easing into it by doing keto this month and had a fell race last weekend and bonked after 4 miles. 

My plan is to attempt carnivore again next month for 30 days. I'm eating 80% carnivore just having a few nuts each day. Although my mental health has definitely improved, my running performance has definitely taken a nosedive.",

log4ny0,t1_locr6oq,1fmqti3,Yes the comment that carbs are essential for high intensity is the next stage to be addressed. There are examples of world class athletes doing high intensity on zero carbs. Ryan Talbot is just one such example and competes in the decathlon for team USA. He runs a 10.6 sec 100m on zero carbs. I‚Äôve spoken to him about this. He has similarly impressive results in his other 9 events.,

loery1z,t1_loef4r7,1fmqti3,"As a fellow distance athlete (runner + like to lift), I'm wondering this too. From what I've gathered from this sub and /r/carnivorediet, folks often claim 90 days or thereabouts.

I am only on my third week (today is day 15) and, while I feel fantastic overall, my usual workouts feel more taxing and I lack ""vigor"" for lack of a better way to describe it.

I'd be very interested in hearing OP's thoughts.",
loek8rm,t1_loef4r7,1fmqti3,"I‚Äôve adapted gradually. I like training early morning, so always trained fasted for the last 4-5y. For the Long trains I used to take some fruit with me to load at the middle of the train. I started low carb by reducing refined carbs, and I tried to stretch the training to be fasted for longer, to a point I can do a long trains always without any food. Actually, I eat as much as it is needed to feel satiated, and never consider if next day I have a long session. I took like 6 months to get adapted. I read the book ‚ÄúThe Maffetone Method‚Äù from Phil Maffetone, the lesson learned is that there is an optimal HR range to promote fat burning. This book I fully recommend, is a life changer. When I started carnivore, I was fully adapted to burn fat, but carnivore is not necessary for that matter, but it helps as it is zero carb way of eating.",
lomwkmd,t1_loef4r7,1fmqti3,It took me 3/4 months to get to about 90% athletically. That last 10% was elusive. Probably took a full 9 months. Your experience may vary.,
lordblm,t1_log4xkw,1fmqti3,"Cheers man, can't wait to get adopted by fat!",
lomc034,t1_log53l7,1fmqti3,"It‚Äôs funny, Once you feel what your body can do being adapted, you will never go back. 

Keep it up.",
loex7uh,t1_loery1z,1fmqti3,"I recommend the book ""The Maffetone Method"", definitively, this one helped me a lot. Idea is training at a heart rate on the lower side of zone 2, considering the typical 5 HR zones. This correspond to an effort where you can maintain a conversation, or breath through the nose. If you follow this, you will improve your aerobic capacity, so no need to chase vigorous efforts",
lohgc5c,t1_loery1z,1fmqti3,"Yes definitely feeling the same. Just trying to motivate myself by listening to podcasts on this WOE. It seems to make sense and I really want to experience the supposed benefits. Unfortunately I do have a few races here and there and although on training runs I'm not killing myself I do have to push myself on the races. Feels like I have nothing in my legs. I have said I will do 30 days next month but like you have said 90 days seems to be the amount of time everyone says you need to give this WOE to reap the benefits. 

I have a race next weekend so I will maybe try upping my fat leading up to it. It's hard to know how much to eat really.",

Kerrygold included in some way with most meals.

Lots of Salt.   I do use Ground Pepper.

A very brief background: I'm a 150 lb, 6'0"" (slender) 37-year old, who has been working through chronic illness of the body, that predominantly feels nestled in the sinuses/face/brain/throat (feels like a thick toxic film is coating all of it). I gave up on Western approaches long ago (all they prescribe are antibiotics, steroids and proposed surgery), and I have been at the herbal/supplemental drawing board for years with my naturopath.

I tried carnivore once, but only for three weeks. It was difficult to note any discernible shifts in that small window of time, but I gave in eventually because a) I wasn't pooping at ALL and had to resort to enemas, and b) my body seemed to be craving carbohydrates as an energy source, so I felt sluggish, tired and weighted down. I was conscientious about my electrolyte intake.

My questions are:

1.) Did you have any bowel issues from the get-go?

2.) Did you purchase store-bought bone broths, jerkies, etc.? I ask because it seems like most of the store-bought stuff has other ingredients like celery, garlic, etc. for taste.

3.) From your personal experience, do you really see carnivore diet as an elimination diet, in that perhaps there are deeper, energetic or physiological needs to tend to for your body to not react so strongly to various herbs, plants and the like? In other words, do you feel the carnivore diet truly sustainable, or can the diet be looked at as a temporary fix (like any other elimination diet) while needing to attend to greater issues at play? I feel as if I might know the answer already based on your journey, but am curious to hear your thoughts.

4.) With the information you've collected over the years, do you think EVERYONE should be entertaining a carnivore diet, or do you feel it's just based off one's constitution, genetics, biological makeup, etc.?

5.) Do you find it important to seek out meat that is organic, grass fed, local, etc., and have you noted any differences between those kinds and cheaper store-bought stuff?

6.) What was a day-in-the-life meal plan for you in the first couple years?

That's all! Feel free to answer some or all (or none!). Thank you again for sharing your story and for being open to answering questions. Apologies if any of these have you repeating yourself, or if they come off as naive.

Much gratitude.",

I don't know how much of my results are because of organ meats and brain.

Probably most important thing is the fact that I was not eating plant toxins and sugar.

But I had a feel that brain is good because it's literally neurons. So it should have everything my body needs to heal and rebuild the damaged neurons.

The other thing I did was supplementing with vitamin D and magnesium.

My recovery took years of being consistent with everything and doing lots of self experimentation.

Now 8 years later I feel like I'm 99% recovered. And not only having had GBS doesn't hold me back, but it also changed me in a good way. Now I'm a different person who's ready to take on any challenges life has to offer and take better responsibility for the things that matter to me. If I left my health and recovery for the doctors and didn't take the responsibility of my health to my own hands, I wouldn't have made as good of a recovery.

I'm highly confident that strict carnivore is a really great base diet to start with for managing in recovering from most autoimmune conditions. But it's not a magic bullet. You have to do a lot of experimentation to figure out what works for you and what doesn't. It's not a replacement for proper treatment of the acute onset of the disease.

2) I made my own bone broth and tallow, for jerkies I sometimes found things that where pure beef and salt. But it's hard to come by such things. And I usually prefer to just eat half cooked fresh meat rather than old dried products.

3 & 4) After years of living this lifestyle I think it's the way we're supposed to eat. Any other way of eating is not natural. It's like putting diesel in a petrol car. It may work, but I don't even want to try. All the evidence points out to the fact that historically our ancestors were hyper carnivores. I think Carnivore should be the default standard for everyone and any other form of eating should be the exception. And it's actually better for the environment and more sustainable to eat grazing ruminants.

Most people would get sick in the long run if they don't regularly consume animal based fat and protein.

5) Get what you can afford and what is accessible to you. Store-bought grain-fed meat is significantly more nutritious than anything that isn‚Äôt animal-based. If you can easily get grass-fed meat from a local rancher who treats the animals well, that would be optimal. However, don‚Äôt let perfect be the enemy of the good by not eating meat just because you can‚Äôt get the best quality.

6) usually two meals a day. I don't have a preplanned eating schedule. I just start eating when I get hungry and stop eating when meat no longer tastes good to me because I'm too full to be able to eat more. This usually leads to two meals a day for me. But sometimes one meal or three to five meals a day. And my meals are whatever is available and I like, which is usually steak and BBQ. I don't restrict my eating or count macros. I eat all kinds of fatty meat that tastes good to me. If you want to have an idea of how much food I'm eating in a day, I'm 65kg/143lbs 173cm/5'8"" and I eat 1 to 2 kg of meat a day. (2.5 to 4.5 lbs). Many people do Carnivore to loose weight, I gained a lot of muscle while on carnivore and it involved a lot of eating and consistently training.

The chronic health situation can be so draining and dejecting.  I may have mentioned it, but I am a freelancer and self-employed, and am mobile quite often.  So I think one of the most difficult things perceptibly holding me back from this full-fledged diet is having consistent access to it.  And eating on the road, or in restaurants, one must be very careful with the cross-contamination of other elements (i..e, gluten).  But there's so much at steak (intentional misspelled pun :), and it's evidently so worth it in the long-run to go all in.

I suppose one follow-up question I have is a hybrid of questions 1 and 6, which is, how much did/do you emphasize fat intake, particularly in connection with having better bowel movements.  Did you use lots of tallow starting out, or butter/ghee?

Ah, and you may have answered this in your initial post, but how long did it take you to start feeling legitimate benefits once you went full carnivore?  I mentioned I had a three-week stint with the diet, but it didn't seem long enough for me to gauge bonafide benefits.

Thanks again. And yes, I would be grateful for any links/references/talks you deem correlative with what we're talking about.

Much gratitude!",

lara8d3,t1_lapzazl,1dj69f1,"I was keto for more than a year when I started carnivore, so my experience and take on it is a bit different than people who may go straight into carnivore.

Because I was coming from keto, I was used to eating a lot of fat. So just eating by taste and cravings worked for me. If I craved more fat, I ate fattier things and if I craved more lean things, I ate more lean.

For most people after a lifetime of everybody screaming that fats are unhealthy and we should limit fat intake, at the beginning they tend to just under eat fats if they go by taste and cravings. Because they‚Äôve never experienced eating enough fat consistently for a long time, so they have no idea of what fat cravings and eating enough fat feels like.

I experienced this in my early weeks of keto and had to intentionally eat lots of fat.

I have some rendered fats like tallow and ghee that I sometimes use in cooking but I don‚Äôt use it as a main source of nutrition and fats. I use it because I‚Äôm pan frying something and don‚Äôt want it to stick to the pan.

For getting fat I just eat fattier cuts of meat. And a delicacy I enjoy eating is BBQing lamb/beef fat cubes in a skewer. I would cut the fat into half inch cubes and use a narrow steel skewer to cook them over charcoal. The exterior would turn crispy while interior is moist.


For me seeing noticeable results from carnivore was fast, because I was already fully fat adapted to being with.


Humans are supposed to always be in ketosis and that‚Äôs our bodies primary metabolism. 

Unfortunately modern diet and lifestyle keeps people on sugar metabolism all the time and many people rarely experience their bodies primary mode of metabolism.

If someone has put their body through that kind of abuse for decades, they have some catching up to do with their bodies, metabolism and developing a healthy relationship with food. For some people this may take weeks, for some it may take months or even a couple years for the body to recover from all that abuse.

Nourish your body for a long time with what it‚Äôs supposed to be fed, and give it some time to recover from all those years of eating what your body didn‚Äôt want to be fed with.

It‚Äôs important to eat the right things, but it‚Äôs way more important to not eat the wrong things.

Our bodies are made up of the things we‚Äôve been eating in the past years. When we stop eating inflammatory and poisonous things, they don‚Äôt just go away. You‚Äôre just not adding to what‚Äôs already there. It will take years for the body to recycle itself and replace all those tissues with newly built tissues.

And things like oxalates may even stay in the body for decades.

And even after all tissues are recycled, there may be some damage that's not going to easily go away.

For example sugar, if you stop eating sugar, after a few days your body has already got rid of all the sugar. But the inflammation, oxidative damage to the tissues and insulin resistance is here to stay for a while longer.

It's fascinating that we're constantly feeding our bodies the wrong things and it's always fighting ti get rid of them and our body still sort of functions after all that abuse.

It's only after we stop feeding the body crap that it tries to get rid of, that it gets the space to put it's resources into things other than trying to get rid of crap.",

m63n7b3,t1_m63gkuy,1hwldzm,My bowel movements have slowed down that's the only setback but they are clean  that's for sure I wonder if that will change if anything slowed down a bit but I am eating lots of fats to combat being constipated which I'm.not constipated but bowel movements have slowed down and become cleaner and more compact sorry for the details,
m649tlj,t1_m63gkuy,1hwldzm,Yup. No change in bowel movements here. But I did go low carb for a few months first.,
m632mm5,t1_m62k8ln,1hwldzm,You are not everyone.,
m62x4t0,t1_m62so90,1hwldzm,"i had to eat very fatty initially, had 3500 - 4000 cals a day, at an 85 - 90% fat ratio, so 330 - 400g of fat a day, 88 - 150g of protein (F, 5'6"")

leaner was intolerable and eating less meant losing weight but i started at the size i wanted to be, this wasn't for weight loss. 

part of the reason for my low appetite was realising I needed to eat at that high fat ratio, then finding tasty sources of fat. at that high ratio, in those quantities most fats were ü§¢ü§ÆüòÇ

now i eat around 75% fat ratio and about 1/2 of what I used to, plus feast days. my average protein is around 125g

(the extra at the beginning was needed for recovery, increasing muscle & none density, i went down a size at same weight)",ü§¢ü§ÆüòÇ
m63t0d6,t1_m63n7b3,1hwldzm,Sounds like you are over that phase already and things have already smoothed out. When I am carnival for a while I will slow down to maybe every other day. I just got a lot of stuff to pass through right now.,
m63f00v,t1_m632mm5,1hwldzm,You have to ask yourself what type of meat and are they getting enough fats in its a legitimate question because I have gone on carnivore before and not eaten enough fats and felt like crap and also crave sugar like crazy but when I do it right this never happens I have experienced the suck they are mentioning also but because of immediately dropping carbs and no fat to replace,

Targeted Carnivore, settled for keto if I could get it, and may not technically have.  Nevertheless, ALL my numbers except LDL got drastically better, and I dropped from 323 to 258.  Doctor congratulated me, asked what I was doing, and threw a fit when I told him.  He was a doctor and put himself through college and med school by being a personal trainer...he knew it all about diet, etc, and essentially ordered me to start eating carbs again.  Being a former carb addict, I went off the rails, so to speak.

By the next appointment, I'd regained 58 of the 65.  The doctor threw a fit again!  He then darn near forced a psych consult on me because I must have become mentally ill to have accomplished so much but blown it so quickly, but I decidedly, calmly, and consistently indicated (as in there was no way I was ever going to leave him out of my story) that I simply followed his instructions and that, if he has a carbohydrate addict (a fat person with the associated health issues and prescriptions) for a future patient who manages to get himself all but completely off carbohydrates, let him!

As this study showed: 
‚ÄúSimilarly, Poropatich et al., [11] found that anti-TPO and/or antithyroglobulin antibody titers were present in only 50% of the patients with euthyroid, cytology-proven Hashimoto thyroiditis, a finding never reproduced by these or other authors in the literature. Given the wide range of normal values for TSH (1 fold) and the variability on the presence of TPO autoantibodies, it is conceivable that early Hashimoto's autoimmune process might be clinically missed. These issues, together with the awareness that sub-clinical and clinical hypothyroidism associates with cardiovascular and neuropsychiatric morbidities, make finding high prevalence of Hashimoto thyroiditis on cytology, especially in euthyroid patients clinically significant [12-14].‚Äù

This study demonstrated that subclinical Hashimoto‚Äôs maybe as prevalent as Type 2 Diabetes, where previously it was thought as prevalent as Type 1 (this is discussed earlier that what I quoted).

Facts are that other than new cropland being opened up, say, in the Amazon, which has nothing to do with most of us here in the western world, you can actually make an argument that each cow raised for meat removes carbon from the atmosphere. 

To start with, cows do not ""create"" carbon. They get it from their food ie plants. Plants get carbon from the air. Yes, some of the carbon that the cows return to the atmosphere is in the form of methane, but likewise, some of the carbon captured by the plants also came from methane that was emitted years past. So, the whole thing is an almost net zero cycle. The almost part comes from the fact that the meat, bones and hide of the cow also contain carbon which is captured ie not returned to the atmosphere. That is roughly 100 lbs of carbon per cow.

lt2ug6m,t3_1g8w02p,1g8w02p,"So many many things!   (Obligitory I'm not a doctor, this is not medical advice, these are just my opinions and observations).

First, there is a direct moral/ethical component.  Lots of people these days grew up adjacent to Meat=Murder and totally believe that to their soul.  Vegans feel morally justified to do all kinds of things in the name of meat being murder.

Second, there are scores of online health/wellness/lifestyle personalities that make pretty controversial claims about diagnostic data, standard of care regarding diabetes, psoriasis, PSA, RA, IBS, various communicable viruses, blood pressure stats, lipid blood panels, preventative medicine, and much more.  I believe a lot of what these doctors have to say, especially since I've been able to reverse my Psoriasis and PSA symptoms down to nothing this year with carnivore (obligitory N=1, your results may vary, etc. etc.).  The problem is, your doctor will do a couple of blood tests, take one look at your LDL cholesterol levels and flip their shit.  They don't know anything about keto or carnivore, they just believe your heart is about to explode, regardless of what your other scores look like or how well you are improving otherwise.

Third, related highly to the second, Some carnivore enthusiasts and online personalities happen to take political positions.  Those positions tend to be right of center.  I don't think it's controversial to say that generally, Reddit, most advertisers, and general internet culture has their political compasses dialed in to at the very least to the left of center.  Everything gets politicised, especially on an election year.  I think it's sad that academics, science and medicine have been dragged into the political arena because it doesn't serve the public to do so but here we are.  ""Jordan Peterson Bad"" so ""Carnivore diet Bad too"". It's just the way things are now adays.

Fourth, I'm pretty sure if everyone went Keto/Ketovore/Carnivore, (fanfiction incoming) the entire western economic system would burn down or at the least we'd have a supply chain crisis that would throw the marketplace into chaos.  Grocery stores wouldn't be able to sell the vast majority of the products available on shelves, you'd be buying and raising your own chickens the moment you could get a coop built, people of means would be buying freezers full of beef from local ranchers before it was too late.  The price of insulin, GLP1 inhibitors, statins, and other drugs would shift to bottom dollar, most people would become skeptical of their doctors as they would feel misled for a lifetime.

1) can't let go of that way of thinking, so they bring it to this WOE, missing that simplicity is a fundamental part of why carnivore works

2) see an opportunity to profit, whether as an influencer selling their perfect way to do carnivore (""it needs to be super high fat"" ""no you need to eat liver"" ""you need to eat grass fed steaks from this company I'm totally not paid to promote"") or nonsense recipes for carnivore cakes or bread (which really stretch those words to the point of meaninglessness

updating: 

Scratch all that, I found it. 

The look she was going for, very low body fat, that's not something we promote here. 

Looking at pictures of women from all sorts of hunter-gatherer cultures, all around the world, even when the women are very lean, they have more of a fat layer on their arms and stomach.

Similarly with the women I know who have naturally lean physiologies -- it runs in their family, they can eat lots of anything. They are size 00 and elegantly lean. They have more of a fat layer. 

Our cultural trend of very low body fat -- trying to look like sprinters in season or bodybuilding bikini contest levels of leanness -- is not a healthy trend. 

Women often attain that leanness through cico & exercise (and some will then get surgery to fill back in the areas where a woman would have more healthy firm fat tissue, like breast tissue. 

For the immune system, it's good to have a normal healthy fat layer, and there's aesthetic benefit to having more breast and hip fat tissue.

lgcqaix,t1_lgcipu6,1ej329t,"It's a common perception.  I know why it exists, because I have been behind the scenes for both subreddits.  The tl;dr summary is that people mistake ""passive"" moderation with ""permissive"" moderation and ""active"" moderation is mistaken for ""restrictive"" moderation.

r/zerocarb has had active moderation for a long time (more than 10 years).  For a while, we had a decent sized team (for the size of the subreddit), and we could be making 60-100 moderation actions a day. Now, we're down to two moderators and the automated actions remain high, but we have done our best to reduce the need for manual actions. If you posted something, there was a very good chance it would be reviewed by a human and responded to. If it was borderline, we might ask you to make some changes. There were frequent visible messages on the subreddit about posts/comments being removed for rule violations. But, we allowed coffee, tea, non-caloric sweeteners (discouraged but allowed with moderation oversight), drugs, raw (when I had time, since I was/am the only mod that eats any significant amount of meat raw), etc. If it was aligned with Stefansson, the Bear, ZIOH, and/or Donaldson it was allowed.

r/carnivore was being run by one moderator, who was not active. He set up very strict rules. No coffee, no tea, no mushrooms/drugs, no sweeteners, etc. He then added an automoderator script that caught a bunch of words that would show up in posts that broke these rules. Posts/comments with those words would be filtered and go to the queue. There would be no notice that the post was not visible on the subreddit. And, it could be very counterintuitive to figure out if your post was up or not. It would seem like a lot of posts were going through, and they looked up from the poster's perspective, but they were not live on the subreddit.  The mod rarely, if ever, reviewed the queue. When he brought other mods on board for help, we found thousands of posts/comments that went back over a year. Many of those didn't break any rules. And, there were tons of rule-breaking posts/comments on the subreddit that just happened to not be caught by the filter. Those weren't removed because the mod wasn't reviewing anything. It seemed a lot more permissive here, even though the rules were much stricter and many posts were being silently removed. When compared to the number of members, more posts/comments per member were removed on r/carnivore than r/zerocarb.

For example, if you posted, ""I never drink coffee."" It would have been manually reviewed on r/zerocarb and then approved. There's a chance you would have known we were reviewing it, but we were online often and it may have been up in less than a minute. On r/carnivore, it would have gone to the blackhole of the mod queue and never seen the light of day, even though it was completely aligned with the rules. But, you would think it was up.

If you posted, ""Drink a couple cups of coffee when you are constipated."" It would have been removed on r/zerocarb and we would have asked you to make it more of an experience and less a recommendation. We might ask if you could reference The Bear or Donaldson (both who suggested coffee helps increase bowel movements). It would likely eventually make its way up on the subreddit. On r/carnivore, it would silently vanish and you'd never know it wasn't up.

We also had strict rules about referencing other subreddits, selling advice/supplements/etc, and referring to people who give non-carnivore advice as experts in carnivore. A lot of people were frustrated by those rules.

So, yeah, it seemed more relaxed because the mod never responded to anything, your posts always seemed to go through, and the filters were not perfect so rule-breaking posts were pretty commonly visible.",

now, there's lots of people trying it out who, frankly, would get the improved health and body composition they are looking for by doing an old school low carb diet and mods have put that in the Getting Started and will tell redditors who haven't tried that first to do so, they'll say that directly in a reply or in modmail.

It's really hard to get food without sugar in it in the US, other than buying meat and vegetables and making it yourself, and they start giving kids piles of sugar from the get go and constant snacking.

ldyuchk,t3_1e6lrew,1e6lrew,"You'll have an easier time if you transition slowly, especially if you've never been in ketosis before. I'd shift to eating only meat over 2 to 3 weeks. I would eliminate all grains and seed oils to start, then ease off fruits and vegetables to make the transition to ketosis easier. Replace one meal a day with only meat for a week, then two meals for a week, then eliminate the fruits and vegetables. Slowly transitioning will help build up the right bacteria in your gut. Doing it cold turkey is a recipe for disaster pants.

Some meats should always be fully cooked, while red meat is often eaten rare or uncooked in the middle. I suggest you start with fully cooked meats as they will digest easier. If someone is cooking you a steak or burger, make sure it's well done. You can shift to medium or rare later. Meat requires more chewing. Start with small bites. Too big of bite makes your body feel like it's too much with the desire to spit it out. Start with the size of a sugar cube if you struggle. Meat will also chew easier if you cut it across the fibers: more work the knife, less work with the mouth. It can take your body a while to adapt to digesting more fat if you've been eating low fat (most vegetarians have been). I wouldn't worry about adding extra fat in the beginning.

You might hear about fasting, but given the condition of your body, you should not fast. Instead I would suggest eating as much as you can tolerate to give your body the nutrients it needs to heal.

I would suggest limiting poultry and pork as they are often fed garbage diets. I would also limit chicken breasts and roasts as they have very little fat. The body needs fat _or_ carbohydrates and cannot function just on protein. As a carnivore diet has almost no carbohydrates (eggs and dairy have some), you need fat. Eggs and dairy are common allergens so you probably want to eliminate those.

If you really want to turbocharge things, go for the ultimate elimination diet of beef, water, and salt. The body needs far less vitamin C when not eating carbohydrate, and there is trace amounts in meat. If you find yourself low on vitamin C, liver is a good source (tip: liver needs to be not be overcooked to not taste awful, so requires cooking very slowly to cook all the way through).

You are indeed eating dead bodies. Be thankful for the nourishment given to you by the animals. Most animals raised for food live much better lives until the time of slaughter. Slaughter is a kinder death than they would get by being attacked by a wild predator.",

And I reacted badly to eggs, chicken, turkey, and nearly all plants by then.¬†


I wish I hadn't been encouraged to use bone broth, cooked low and slow increases histamine, or aged/fermented/canned foods, high in histamine. Ground meats have more surface area and are higher in histamine. My functional medicine doctors kept encouraging me to reintroduce different plants and herbal supplements. I also became reactive to most of my auto immune meds.¬†


After eating mostly meat for the last two years, my inflammation went down and I was able to start aquatic therapy to get stronger. As I had begun falling down all the time about 9 years ago.¬†
My list of health issues is nearly countless. Although, my lupus/RA seems to be doing better. We'll be checking my lyme disease this week. My hashimoto's is bananas for the last 4 years. I also treated positive for so many viruses, bacteria, parasites, amoeba, etc. that my gi doc laughed and said you'd be in the hospital. I glared at him and said which time? Bc they won't keep me. My EDS hypermobility is improving on sea lion diet.¬†


What I eat now, beef (boneless ribeye, picanha, top sirloin, beef fat; must be non aged and freshly butchered from butcher; grocery store beef makes me sick), and less frequently beef liver(i wouldn't eat liver as a child then a veg until i became carnivore, now it's delicious), scallops, flounder, steelhead, lobster tails, mussel meat, Swiss cheese freshly sliced unaged, kretschmar American with no soy... I have noticed that I am not satiated as easily with fish or seafood as I am with beef and beef fat. The key to lower histamine is fresh, freshly frozen, or freshly freeze dried. Grain/grass fed doesn't seem to affect me.¬†


I did give up coffee and tea and herbal tea. I had issues with pain so was using alcohol and mmj to help with that. I'm still on a little mmj for sleep and cigarettes. Hopefully, I can stop them soon. Even with a dirty sea lion diet, I lost over 70 lbs and a ton of inflammation in the first 6 months. People comment now that I don't look like my photos anymore. Now I don't sunburn, I just tan. Exercise is easier now. I didn't exercise at the beginning. When the inflammation goes down, exercise might become possible again. I keep having to buy new leggings, bc my lifelong chunky thighs shrank so fast the first year that they'd fall to my knees when I stood up. Some days they stay up, others they simply don't. Drawstrings are your friend.¬†


Being Veg nearly unalived me. Carnivore is saving me even though it's taking longer bc of how sick I'd gotten. I was 345lbs when I stopped weighing myself or taking photos. Now, I'm around 182-195lbs depending on my dairy intake.¬†


If you try rabbit and chicken first, maybe try digestive enzymes. But your body may do fine with ruminate meats. So allow for your body to tell you what is reacting to.

1. **Start Slow**: Begin by introducing bone broth and meat-based broths into your diet. These are nutrient-dense and can help your body start adapting to animal products without being overwhelming.
2. **Choose Mild Meats**: Start with meats that are generally easier to digest, like chicken or fish. Ground meats can also be less intimidating and easier to handle.
3. **Incorporate Organ Meats Gradually**: Organs like liver are incredibly nutrient-dense. Start with small amounts, maybe mixed into ground meat dishes, to get used to the taste and texture.
4. **Stay Hydrated and Monitor Electrolytes**: Transitioning diets can sometimes affect your hydration and electrolyte levels. Make sure you're drinking enough water and consider supplementing with electrolytes if necessary.
5. **Listen to Your Body**: This is crucial. Your body will guide you on what it can handle. If something doesn‚Äôt feel right, don‚Äôt push it. Adjust and find what works best for you.
6. **Seek Support**: Consider working with a healthcare provider or a diet coach familiar with the carnivore diet, especially given your health conditions. They can provide personalized guidance and support.
7. **Mental Preparation**: It‚Äôs normal to feel repulsed or uncomfortable initially. Acknowledge these feelings, but also try to focus on the potential health benefits and improvements you might experience.

Remember, everyone‚Äôs journey is unique. Be patient with yourself and give your body time to adjust. I wish you all the best on your path to better health.

Take care,

I know people on the animal based use dairy, avacado, butters and nut butters all to get their fat.

Or you can use non-minced beef fat, trimmings/tallow.",

As someone with AI (rheumatoid arthritis) there is definitely a significant difference in symptoms when I go strict carnivore. Decrease in fatigue, decrease in inflammation, decrease in pain.


It's 100% worth trying.¬†


A huge problem with vegetation is that we lack the proper microbiome in our gut to process veg our predecessors had (probably because of antibiotics and shitty food that wrecks out gut lining).


Your body might need time to adjust but keep in mind, we evolved to survive famine so if our bodies didn't adapt between dietary changes we wouldn't be here!¬†

The ingredient list on the boxes it comes in reads: Beef, 11% of seasoned solution of water, adobo base (water, chipotle chile, rice bran oil, less than 2% of cumin, garlic, oregano, and black pepper), seasonings (salt, spices), vinegar, garlic.

Both the steak and the Barbacoa have this ""adobo base"" made with rice bran oil. The steak is not supposed to be cooked with oil (though sometimes they just do + there's whatever left over from the chicken).

I wish I would've started questioning things sooner because going carnivore is arguably the best thing for my health that I ever did.,
kr488fa,t3_1au6z0r,1au6z0r,"Hi,

New to carnivore (\~approx 6 months).

I try not to evangelize on this anymore because of what you and I and all the others know about the response. In any case, It's a huge positive life change for me.  None of the other methods I tried worked:  vegetarian, lo-carb, meat avoidance, meditation, anti-depressants, etc... Since carnivore, I dumped the meds and dumped the happy pills and I sleep better, think more clearly, no joint aches and no more anxiety.  Weight loss is not my primary goal as much as I wanted to avoid diabetes after a shitty pre-diabetes diagnosis last summer.  However, I have lost weight but there is more to go before I get to my personal ideal weight.  But the anxiety and joint pain leaving is HUGE. 

So...I think non-carnis are averse to it because 1.) ignorance of the results and the science behind it 2.) societal conditioning of the 'balanced diet' 3.) the idea of eating only ONE THING is strange and downright repugnant if the one thing is MEAT.

The worm has turned though, because carnis exist, the good doctors and researchers exist and current, relevant science exists that proves carnivore has positive effect on human beings.  I look forward to more science that shows the benefit of the carnivore lifestyle.",

kr4s37k,t3_1au6z0r,1au6z0r,"Besides the effects of marketing and all the dietary advice they may have heard influencing people, I think of it on a cultural and civilization level. The invention of agriculture is what enabled civilization to develop (by providing quantity of food even at the expense of quality of life) and has been an integral part of human history for 12,000 years. That's 12,000 years of almost every culture in the world making plants a diet staple. It's ingrained in every facet life, from socializing to how we structure our day to how we celebrate. 

It's been interesting to me exploring this diet as a history nut because every time I think about it, it's so *logical*. I haven't been hungry like at all the last few weeks and I went searching for posts here, and someone was saying ""Do you think hunter-gatherers were eating 3 meals a day plus snacks? No. They had to be able to wait between hunts."" There are immense drawbacks to civilization and one of them is becoming divorced from our true nature. No one on a SAD would question how little sense it would make for our ancestors to need to eat constantly, and a lot of those food sources (at the time) were barely edible or poisonous. Despite making zero sense, nobody questions it at all. Partly because the majority of people are doing it, and people naturally mimic what they perceive to be success/survival. (As an aside I think some people have the genetics to do better on a SAD than the general population, which is what leads to so many people to get in a horrible loop of following different diets and the next new fad supplement, etc.)

In modern society we are so removed from our own instincts for a lot of different reasons but mostly because it's the compromise that glues civilization together. People aren't just weird about eating a carnivore diet, pretty much every facet of their life is warping them out of their natural state and food is one of them. It's very hard for people to change this conditioning and following your example, it's normal in society for people to have chronic illnesses so they don't think twice about it. It's unfortunate but a lot of people just aren't openminded and seem to have a higher tolerance for suffering, in that they aren't as motivated as others to try to resolve it through methods outside the norm and can accept/ignore a level of chronic pain or discomfort.",

kr4mfkc,t3_1au6z0r,1au6z0r,"A lot of people do actually want to stay ill. They've been ill for so long that it's become a major part of their personality, and they've built most of their social life/community around it. Losing that would mean losing themselves. I know I was absolutely terrified when I was faced with the reality of losing my vegetarian identity; looking back now, I find it ridiculous and I'm glad I let go of unnecessary labels, but until then, it was all I had known, and I was worried I wouldn't know who I was without it. It takes a lot of strength to shift your perspective as an ill adult. Staying in a shitty situation almost seems safer in a weird way.

A lot of people with life-long illnesses have also tried dozens of different diets already, all of which promised to resolve their issues but then never delivered. We know why they failed, but they don't, so they see it as just another diet of deprivation. When you're in constant discomfort from your illness, the last thing you want is to give up even more things, and the carnivore diet definitely requires you give up everything. I'm personally one to try something right away if it sounds as promising and logical as carnivore does, but even I find it incredibly difficult, especially on days when I have pain, nausea, and fatigue from my illnesses.

Meat has also been associated with gluttony from years of brainwashing, and I think people find it repulsive to indulge that much. I know I was shocked to learn how much of it I was supposed to eat. We've also become so far removed from the natural order and have consequently softened up, so most people find killing animals highly immoral, preventing them from even considering it. Then there's the dogma that science has absolutely proven that meat is cancerous and obesogenic. We also have a society where food addiction is the norm rather than the exception, most social settings as well as strong positive and negative life events revolve around it, and everything must taste phenomenal at all times, so it's hard to escape. Pretty much everything that goes against the norm is met with insane resistance when you think about it - even simple diets like gluten-free or lactose-free will be met with dismissal and contempt from people who don't understand it, it's almost expected for carnivore to be so hated.",

""Low fat helps you lose fat"" ""the fat you eat is the fat you wear"", ""Cico is how you lose weight/body fat"".

I used to be vegan so the idea of eating the reverse is very scary. Like am I going to die eating so much meat and fat, clogging my arteries and increasing my chances for heart attack or strokes? I fell for that for 5 years and now I'm more meat based, but suffering from intestinal issues from so much fiber when I was vegan/raw til 4.

Yet Big AG/Pharma and the food pyramid has been around for years saying to eat more grains, fiber, fruit and veg, etc yet eat so much less animal products.

kr40bw8,t3_1au6z0r,1au6z0r,"The response I get most often after I'm asked about my diet as I start explaining it is ""I couldn't live without eating fruits"". 

I usually just respond that ""I never told you to do my diet. It's your life"", then just continue with the benefits that I experience.  

People have their ""truths"" rooted into them deeply with a lots of subjects. It's not easy for anyone to accept that they have been lied to all their lives. If you try to convince anyone that they are wrong about one of their ""truths"", it's more than likely that they will become defensive and try to prove you wrong.  
If you want to help them, the best you can do is make them curious, show them your success until they start to ask you for advice. Never try to argue with someone or act superior, because it will have the opposite effect.  

It's not an easy task to make someone believe that for example fruits are bad, when all their lives they have been told by everyone that it's healthy. People are often too lazy to think for themselves, and just prefer to accept the narrative instead.  

*Tinfoil hat on*  
By narrative what I mean, is not only the interests of big pharma. Consuming carbs is also in political interest.  
I believe that since it's harder and harder for countries to sustain the Ponzi scheme that they built (see website: wtfhappenedin1971), since animal based foods are much more expensive to produce, if everyone would switch to that, the majority of the people would starve. From history we know what usually happens to leaders when people are starving.

I just wish the medical industry would pay more attention. There‚Äôs got to be a fire when there‚Äôs this much smoke!

I‚Äôm convinced that there‚Äôs no single perfect human diet, so I‚Äôm sure carnivore isn‚Äôt for everyone. But I‚Äôm also confident that it is exactly the right diet for a helluva lot of people.

There‚Äôs just so much dogma and propaganda to wade past and so much brainwashing to unpack; I think it holds a lot of people back from reaching optimal health.",
loo9cgq,t1_lonpp6v,1fnfhwp,"I‚Äôm primarily OMAD, but don‚Äôt hesitate to have a second meal if I‚Äôm particularly hungry (that happens maybe once a fortnight). That wasn‚Äôt really a conscious decision ‚Äì it just happened naturally. 

I‚Äôm a night owl and don‚Äôt wake until 11am, so I eat at my natural dinner time, which is around 8pm (6-7 hours before bedtime). 

I‚Äôve never been a breakfast eater, but now I rarely get hungry throughout the day. If I am, I might cook up a 250g sirloin or porterhouse, or 2 x 125g smash patties. Luckily, I work from home, so there‚Äôs no risk of getting caught out by not preparing a lunch in advance. 

Every second night, I cook a 800g-1kg eye fillet roast or scotch fillet roast. I usually can‚Äôt quite finish it and leave a small amount (~200g) to eat cold with dinner the next night, or as lunch on those days I feel like it.

Alternating nights are usually a 500g rump steak or 2 x scotch fillet steaks (~400g). 

I‚Äôve discovered I prefer leaner cuts with added fats, so I cook everything in beef dripping. I also just started buying beef fat from the butcher and making beef crackling in the air fryer, so I might do a few small pieces to go with my dinner if I‚Äôm craving it. 

The biggest difference for me is that I‚Äôve become a lot more intuitive when it comes to eating and I feel confident that I can receive and respond to my body‚Äôs signals. 

I was originally hung up about not eating 1kg+ of meat a day and worried that I wasn‚Äôt getting enough fat. But it didn‚Äôt take long for me to start paying attention to my cravings and putting trust in the idea that my body will tell me what it needs. 

I also naturally fast once, sometimes twice, a fortnight. Unlike when I lost the weight on keto, I don‚Äôt consciously do it ‚Äì if I‚Äôm not hungry, I don‚Äôt force myself to eat. I find that it leaves my appetite unchanged the following day.

It's good to do anytime, but if you do it the day before your fast, you'll have provided your body what it needs to build muscle and bone density signalling you are not in a state of scarcity, revved up your metabolism, and your body can draw down on your fat tissue for energy that fast day.",

Even if you‚Äôre not doing it ‚Äúperfectly‚Äù, you‚Äôre miles ahead compared to eating the SAD. 

I came from 18 months on strict keto and I still had an adjustment period. 

And I honestly wouldn‚Äôt stress too much about trying to add exercise right away. I only added it as my energy levels rose enough that I wanted to exercise. 

I‚Äôm still not particularly active compared to a lot of people. I do a daily walk with my dog, do 60 mins of yoga a week, and maybe go for a hike on the weekend. It‚Äôs only recently that I‚Äôve found myself considering joining my local CrossFit club ‚Äì and that‚Äôs because I‚Äôm feeling strong and have excess energy. 

I don‚Äôt pretend to be any kind of expert, but I think a lot of people come to this diet undernourished and sick. I personally entered with the priority of healing ‚Äì the rest is just kind of taking care of itself.

The way I see it is that I spent years failing my body before it finally started failing me. But it‚Äôs taken less time to heal than it did to reach that point of feeling broken.

Asking it to take on strenuous exercise would have been a bridge too far when I first started, but it hasn‚Äôt taken long to reach the point where my body is actually craving activity. 

I hope you stick with it and be kind to yourself. ‚ù§Ô∏è",‚ù§

It was traditional to have feast days -- celebrations, animal harvests, etc. 

This way of eating isn't about restricting quantities to lose fat, it's about healthy recomp based on hormonal response to the types and quantity of foods being eaten. If you look at the old school body builders -- their leaning out phase for getting competition lean was 8,900 cals per day of protein and fat.

I dont care if they find that rude, I just don't get why they are so careful with vegan restrictions but not with other diets, take as an example that gluten free people often also have people insisting to them to eat fried chicken or something else with bread in it when they clearly state it does them harm.

I also find weird how veganism is so widespread in restaurants that there's whole menus of just vegan dishes but when it comes to other diets it is really hard to find, only the allergens are indicated.

I never turn down a social engagement involving food and I never lie about my food choices but I do NOT EVER brag or preach it. What I have found is that if you quietly are meat selective, are honest when approached, the curious ones will start asking questions. I have converted and semi-converted numerous ppl this way.

I ordered the bacon and eggs, of course it came with tots and avocado and tomatoes, etc.  The nurses that knew me gave a gentle ribbing as they have seen me for the last 6 months become crazy fit off Carnivore... unfortunately, our new nurse manager overheard and chided me in front the other health care professionals with words to the effect, ""I knew a patient that did carnivore and all her teeth fell out, I would be very, very careful on this diet..."" She was English so the accent made it all the worse.  I could think of no rebuttal so I awkwardly smiled and said, (pointing to my pointy, pink gums) ""that my gum health has never been better since starting Carnivore"".  Her response was a joke about never being able to give up chocolate and wine to which the other nurse chuckled in agreement.  I did not comment about her swollen, blotchy face, that she was the same age as me but looked ten years older (like me 6 months ago before going Carnivore), or her lack of curiosity that is endemic of our whole healthcare system, etc.  I just ate my eggs and bacon.

It was an interesting response but shows a bit of a snapshot into how much thought is given to diet by healthcare providers.  Either no thoughts on the subject or wrong thoughts.  Very rarely curiosity. Even more rare is any thought given to diet and its resulting effect on our bodies metabolic health!  Like literally CRICKETS!

I have had more hostile responses than positive, that's for sure... and that is not through me preaching.  It is when I am discovered!  

There is a lot of unstated emotionalism injected into food.  Food/ sugar is grandmother's home cooking, birthday's, celebrations, happiness, God, America, etc.  There has been many years of promoting the idea that cancer, death, ill-health is all from meat.

Don't hurt grandmother!

Was this really suggested to you by your doctor? Maybe we're from different places, but it really isn't common to have doctors where I'm from (Australia) recommending carnivore diets. Like, a big part of being carnivore is knowing the science behind why the health industry is very messed up. Very few doctors know much about nutrition, and there are even fewer doctors who recommend carnivore.

It's for this reason I think that in the many interactions I've had where I've suggested my eating habits are based in an understanding of health and science that has been recommended by doctors, I am often met with skepticism. I can't say I've found it helpful. It can even emphasise awkward tensions because some might take it to imply you are judging their way of eating.

Also not sure if you mean that you say this as a white lie to smooth things over? Because that was sort of what I meant in my OP when I talked about having repeated interactions with people, since that stuff tends to come back up after meeting people more than once. I know it's not a massive thing to be dishonest about, but it does tend to make things harder because often people will go on to ask more questions and before you know it, you're embroiled in a fiction.

For me carnivore did heal a lot of things in my life, but nothing so dramatic. Since severe autoimmune stuff has run in my family, and I have had minor problems related to autoimmune issues (mostly psoriasis), I have mentioned all that as a reason I avoid food that's being offered to me, especially after hearing a lot of carnivores on facebook suggesting that saying stuff like this worked to ease awkwardness in social situations.

In my experience this didn't work. Even when you put in as much effort to qualify everything as I did (i.e., 'it wasn't me with the autoimmune disorder, it was my family'), more often than not people tend to treat it as way more serious than it is, often because they really don't understand the terminology you're using and assume it must be dire. These reactions made me feel icky, like i was leeching off the empathy of people who genuinely suffered much worse than I did. And me feeling icky didn't help the whole social interaction thing.

Not to mention, any empathy this inspires isn't always a good thing. It often isn't even empathy, but it's sympathy. It can be a downward looking 'poor you, that must be awful to have had health problems'. It can turn into people treating you with kid gloves because they are terrified of making you sick by feeding you the wrong thing.

All animal products are on it along with some well-cooked veggies (carrots) and a few fruits (like ripe bananas) are on that diet too, but you can say you tried those veggies and got still the symptoms.

Funny thing is that all the health organizations promote fiber left and right, until your intestines are really messed up like with diverticulitis, or crohn's or that you need an ostomy bag, then they recommend to limit or avoid fiber.

kxe0inz,t1_kxbtz9q,1brw8gf,"I dont disagree that genes play a big role on appearance, but people definetly reach their highest potential on nutrional dense food, aka animal food.

I've watched documentaries where they studied why people in tribes with same gene, even twin brothers had different appearance and one had crooked rotting teeth while the other has perfect straight teeth, turned out the ones with perfect teeth and jaw didn't eat things that are processed or refined but the moment they got introduced to modern food products they began to develop cavities and allergies, and the allergies lead to malformation in face since it forces people to breath through their mouth thus creating recessed chin and undeveloped jaw with lack of high quality protein.

It is undeniable that lack of protein with complete amino acids and fatty acids will result in your body not being the most developed it can, altough people can be beautiful without being on a meat based diet, it doesn't deny that eating meat gives your body all the necessary nutrients for a healthy, beautiful appearance.

kxifcso,t1_kxbtz9q,1brw8gf,"Yes I'm sure that genetics has an influence. However, it shouldn't be controversial that diet has a major impact on facial dimensions and health qualities such as dental health. Back in the 1930s, Weston A. Price traveled to a lot of regions and analyzed health factors for various populations. Uniformly, those people eating traditional whole foods including animal foods had better dental health, were taller, etc. It was typical to see broader faces and larger/straighter teeth in those eating traditionally. Those whose diets had been infiltrated by the industrial foods industry (refined flours and sugars, etc.) had poorer health qualities including tooth cavities, smaller/crooked teeth, etc. Of the populations eating traditional foods, those eating more animal foods had better health factors (better teeth, were taller and broader, etc.).

We don't have the resources to do what you are saying, to run a sprawling dicusdion board which reviews studies. We keep things focused on how to do carnivore. 

For studies, I will say that what we need are over-feeding studies. Well-designed 5,000 - 6,000 calories a day, different compositions, 

(if there was a carnivore arm, they would have to learn how to do it first -- there's no way someone could eat 6,000 out of the gate üòÇ

A single equation with so few controlled variables but so many slack variables that you can apply everywhere and still ""prove"" it. Its scientific value is exactly zero for that very reason. It cannot provide any meaningful prediction, and it cannot be used to design any class of weight control diet or routine. As such, trying to ""prove"" or ""disprove"" it with any kind of studies is fruitless. Therefore, ""calories don't matter"", and the fact that these studies have to control and adjust so many slack/uncontrolled variables reinforces that statement.

The MIMO (Mass in, Mass out) model, however, paints a different picture. It has a few more equations, less uncontrollable variables, and it can provide measurable predictions, which have yet to be disproven. That is a valid scientific theory with meaningful applications.",

kylmixk,t1_kyl0z7k,1by5l7j,"Sure. My breakfast usually consists of a selection of salo 

1) cured pork fat - I made a post about it earlier. It‚Äôs delicious, there are different kinds so it‚Äôs hard to get bored and it‚Äôs perfect for carnivore. It also does wonders for controlling hunger. If I hungry throughout the day and have no time to eat a couple of slices of cheese and salo completely takes care of it. The only 2 ingredients are pork fat and salt. 

2) jamon - I have started buying whole legs at Costco after a recent trip to Spain. It‚Äôs delicious lasts forever since it has to be sliced thin and has zero ingredients other than pork and salt. 

3) a selection of other meats for variety (think salami, other interesting deli cuts I find at stores, etc). 

4) cheeses - I love them all and I buy most of them at Aldi which has a decent selection and i can get a bit of everything. 

I am not a huge fan of the typical American breakfast of eggs and bacon. I do eat both but prefer the above. 

The rest of the day I snack on jamon, cheese, etc. 

I eat ball kinds of proteins and fats not just beef. I really like pork belly in an air fryer, pork knuckles in a pressure cooker are better than candy if you cook them for a couple of hours and then throw into an air fryers to crisp up on the outside. I like seafood. Shrimp is my go to when I want something delicious and quick. I fry them up in chilly oil and salt and pepper. I like salmon, but I eat it raw. Cut it up for sashimi with a bit of soy sauce and a bit of wasabi (I know that‚Äôs not exactly strict carnivore but I don‚Äôt use a lot of it and it works for me). 

For a quick meal I make fish cakes out of canned salmon (mix with a little eggs, crushed chicharrones and salt/pepper). They‚Äôre better than restaurant fish cakes. 

I just tried making cakes out of canned beef :) and they came out DELICIOUS. Again I don‚Äôt really eat canned foods often but they are really convenient sometimes when you need something very quick. Also look at ingredients. If you‚Äôre using canned salmon use the one that has salmon, salt and that‚Äôs it. Same with beef. It‚Äôs basically pressure cooked beef in its own juices and fat. Nothing else. 

Sometimes I just want a sandwich and I make ‚Äúwaffles) and freeze a bunch of them in advance. Full fat mozzarella (1lb), 4 eggs, chicharrones and some slices like salt, pepper, sometimes with a pinch of basil. That‚Äôs all. In a small waffle maker. They hold their shape, can be toasted later on and make perfect bread substitute. 

Hope that helps!",

Also things like canned beef have just 3 ingredients, beef, fat and salt. I am careful to only stock those. 

Jamon is technically processed meat but the only ingredients are pork, salt and lots of time. Same goes for salo. That‚Äôs just fat and salt. 

Technically the only highly processed meat I eat is salami but we‚Äôre talking about 2-3 pieces at breakfast :)

The fact that people cannot understand that this is the place for pure zero carb carnivores is beyond me. But I guess people don‚Äôt understand a lot of things. 

Animal based is always there for those who want to add carbs or just experiment with it. I‚Äôd love to see research that delineates the difference between long term metabolic health on very low to no omega-6 pufa animal based diet vs a medium-normal O-6 pufa AB vs high O-6 pufa AB.

It can get tricky with this sub, bc the label carnivore is actually not all that specific, and can be indicative of both low omega-6 pufa carnivores like grass fed lion dieters and the carnivores who eat conventional bacon/pork and eggs/poultry and that could be extremely high in omega-6 pufa causing a long term state of insulin resistance, basically forcing them to stay within the confines of that diet. 

I hypothesize that the grass fed lion dieters who exist within this sub, are the most metabolically healthy among the population, along with those who include some pastured eggs, and could add in low pdc carbs (fruit, honey, maple) without any issues but to study that would take decades and a lot of funding. 

So i think there almost should be two zerocarb subs, the affordable one (inclusive of any animal food) where if you eat carbs you basically become diabetic and an even stricter one where you have to be pretty wealthy and neurotic to maintain where only grass fed and pastured ruminants with some eggs are allowed. 

That way the latter could show that adding carbs didn‚Äôt actually wreck their metabolism and the the problem is not apples and fructose but rather the fact that most commercially farmed animals are fed seeds and are packing seed oils in their adipose tissue.",

think of it a short addition to the diet fatten for the winter.

sugar, including from fruit :) has fructose in it and fructose can have negative effects on the liver, including the development of fatty liver..  (and removing it from the diet improves liver health)

there is also the way fructose is involved in fattening -- so fatty meat + fruit, the  fruit sends the signal to store the fat. completely different than the zerocarb carnivore diet. (look up Dr. Richard Johnson's work on fructose and uric acid)

For anyone who has prediabetes or T2D, fruit worsens the condition.

the tight moderation -- knowing it only applies to a small group with little flexibility -- came about because the longterm carnivores found that there was a difference even between what they had already been doing -- low carb, even a very low carb eaten at a ketogenic ratio with intermittent fasting (and incl longer term fasts!) -- and getting rid of all plant foods, taking the carbs to zero.

and the space was for talking about that, living like that, wondering why it makes a difference and starting to gather and discuss info about it. a small corner of the internet that is not filled with discussion, pics and recipes about mixed diets. from experience,

whenever the moderation is lightened up, it gets overrun with ""wannabe carnivores"" who feel that because they eat a lot of meat, their diet fits with this sub. those can be healthy diets as well, but they aren't what this sub is about!

l7y21oo,t1_l7spulf,1db3aii,"I like the way Dr Ken Berry explains this. In our evolutionary past, if we under-ate, it was a signal to the body to hold onto fat reserves because you might have fallen down a ravine and broken your leg and you're stuck there starving, or there was food scarcity and nobody in the tribe was catching any food to eat. Holding onto fat was the body's survival mechanism for getting you through those lean times.

If you eat fatty meat to satiety, your body gets the signal ""We are definitely NOT starving, everything is good, look at all this fat! Ok, it is safe to let go of some of our excess fat reserves.""

It makes a lot of sense from an evolutionary perspective.

Nowadays, people who have chronically dieted have always tried to lose weight by going into a calorie deficit, but all that does is stress the body out because it thinks you are starving, so the body holds into its fat reserves. Even when you lose weight using that method, it's just setting a ticking time bomb for when you will eventually snap and go on a binge because your mammalian body thinks you have been starving. There's no fighting your own biology at that point and you just gorge yourself, that's how binge-purging works.

Well, that's because their way of eating is rooted in an ideology, so all animal products are categorically off-limits.

Thats why when people go carnivore they have overwhelming health improvements to energy, mental health, well being, the works. However, people asking questions about additional things to add to that lifestyle isnt wrong as humans tend to be pretty biodiverse and not ""everything"" is going to cause an adverse negative health outcome. Like mushrooms, not in the plant kingdom, closer to animals, and do not seem to carry the negative adverse outcomes that plants do.

The way someone eats is a personal thing for them. While we can share our own stories, beliefs and what works or does not work for us, a person's diet is an individual thing. Not everything will fall under a specific label, and it is not our place to apply such things.

A post Rhonda Patrick  PhD of foundmyfitness, made yesterday is interesting in regards to the approach here of avoiding muscle loss while gradually losing fat, instead of undereating to rush the fat loss process at the start  (that undereating also leads to muscle loss) --

""Muscle power‚Äîyour ability to generate force quickly‚Äîis one of the strongest predictors of longevity, even more so than being lean. This is sometimes referred to as the 'fat but powerful' paradox.

""In a recent study, older adults with normal and high levels of relative muscle power had better 9-year survival than older adults with low muscle power.

""Muscle power was even protective against death in older adults with high levels of body fatness measured using BMI and waist circumference.

""Being fat and powerful reduced mortality just as much as being lean and powerful‚Äîby 43‚Äì45%.

""Being lean and weak, however, provided no survival advantage compared to being fat and weak.""",

unfortunately, extended fasting leads to muscle loss.

here's what we suggest instead: eat 2x what you usually do in a day then coast until you are hungry again. should be 24-36 hours.

if you are hungry again at the usual time ... that's a sign your body needs it, so try for the fast another time :) 

there is ongoing autophagy -- better to give your body what it needs to rebuild

m4zw0mg,t1_m4zev7v,1hqqp7r,"please don't take multivitamins -- they are designed for normie diets. they aren't needed or appropriate on this one 

here is an example of why: https://x.com/nutritionalthe3/status/1133410751727755264?s=46

it's a chart showing what happens to zinc absorption when the animal food is eaten on its own, compared to when it is eaten with corn or with beans. 

the high, random-ish levels of minerals in supplements can mess with absorption of the ones in meat. google any combination of minerals and you'll see their complex interactions, including some decreasing the  absorption of others. 

For this diet, you're eating the ideal sourres of nutrients without the foods which block their absorption, you need to let them be, not mess things up by taking a supplement. 

there is a section about why not to track calories -- you'll need more initially than you do later on. the 2lbs is a goal to aim for you may need more. i'll get the link later

this doesn't work by calorie restriction/muscle loss, it starts with gaining muscle. you need to eat well to do that, just as a bodybuilder does. they know they can't build muscle out of air, please get your mind around the thought that you are the same :)",

If I'm only eating fatty meat, sometimes eggs, along with a smidge of cheese or HWC as a treat now and then, I doubt that I'm getting a proper amount of calcium.

Also, I take 250mg DiCalcium Malate (Thorne calcium) daily. It's a chelated form of calcium for enhanced absorption closer to that found in food than the cheapo calcium carbonate or citrate supplements.

we don't recommend nose to tail, we advise against it

we don't recommend bone broth

we don't recommend sardines bc of the histsmine levels 

you're eating some cheese and HWC that's fine

but you don't even need that for the calcium -- women with osteoporosis doing the fatty meat only version of this diet show improvement of their condition on their bone scans 

this is all volunteer here, nothing to sell, and the sdvice is not to take supplements unless you have a known deficiency and it is prescribed. 

stop it when the deficiency is resolved bc supplements interfere with absorption of other nutrients and will throw things off 

for example, calcium interferes with the absorption of zinc, by about 50%",

I'm in the same boat, but mostly for dysphagia with my GERD, 40mg of Pantoprazole once a day.  Meat gets stuck in my throat on the way down much more often than other foods, which makes it hard for me to eat enough on carnivore, and often is so bad I have to skip the meal and try again later.  Pantoprazole is the only thing that seems to prevent it from happening, but it still happens occasionally with steak and salmon even when taking it.  I've also had an upper GI and they cleared me with a shrug.  :\

What did you eat for those 2 months and did you ween yourself off or just drop it cold turkey?  Update us in a month or so if you remain cured.  I've tried to drop it many times and it always comes back in a few weeks.  Would love to try what you did and be rid of it forever.",

eg, When someone with T2D or T1D is taking insulin they need to decrease the dose right away when starting low carb or carnivore. (People with T2D often need to discontinue it right away. People with T1D will decrease their basal dose, according to their glucose monitor readings: The decrease for people with T1D is about 1/3 to 1/2 of typical basal dosing and dosing for meals as usual, based on type and quatity.

ltmb0dq,t3_1garcab,1garcab,"I completely lost track of most of the benefits that I've experienced, a few months into the diet. I've never been entirely comfortable with talking about them to other people, because some of the health improvements sound like miracles or something, and I figured most people will probably just assume that I'm lying when I mention the ones that sound the most ""out there"" üòÖ

I've had very few health issues in my life. The biggest, most frustrating issue I've had is persistent, dry eye symptoms. The carnivore diet made me realize that I wasn't sleeping very well prior to it, it made my allergies go away entirely after about 2-3 months, my memory and general cognition improved so much that I was struggling to believe it at one point, and a million trivial issues that I've always taken for granted either vanished or were drastically reduced.

That said, while the diet made me realize that I've likely had a lot of trivial health issues for many years and considered it normal/unproblematic, it took me over a year to realize how complacent I had become from not having those issues anymore. Sometimes, you don't know what you have until it returns.

I'd been on the diet for almost 1.5 years when I went on vacation this summer and decided to eat whatever I was served for 2 weeks. Didn't seem like a big deal, it was only a short vacation. I didn't notice much of a difference during that time, other than irregular bowel movement and bordering constipation. It wasn't until a couple of weeks later that all of the issues started returning.

Allergy was back, dry eye symptoms was back, sleep went from an average of 8-9 hours to 4-5 and I started snoring according to my sleep app. I thought that was bad enough, but then I noticed that I was struggling to recall memories and organize my thoughts while at work, and occasionally I experienced difficulties with stringing sentences together while talking to people. It's issues/improvements like this that I've always been hesitant to talk about with others, because they sound silly and sometimes made up.

As for cognition, I‚Äôm 63 and definitely feel happier and much more mentally sharp than when I was still eating carb-heavy foods, probably due to steady blood glucose and a diet high in amino acids.

ltmlxzl,t1_ltmerjm,1garcab,"It's funny you should mention that, because I recall watching an interview on Youtube with a successful business owner who talked about feeling dumb for over 20 years of his life before discovering the carnivore diet.

I'm not going to pretend to know what the explanation behind that phenomenon could be, but I am curious if carnitine plays a part in it. I've been reading about carnitine lately, mostly related to it's effects on people with autism, but also it's general purpose in the body. It's a nutrient that I find really fascinating.

It's considered a non-essential amino acid because the body produces it naturally (all bodies with red meat do). However, people who have some degree of autism apparently produce a lower amount of it, and it's possible that there are other conditions that reduce the natural production of it as well. Some people would argue that it should be considered essential, but that's complicated by the fact that it's exclusively found in red meat, which we're typically told not to consume much of.

Carnitine is mostly associated with the process of converting fat to energy, but it's also involved in the connection of synpses in the brain and the processing of new information. It has garnered more attention recently, since they did an experiment in Australia (last year, I believe) where they put groups of people with autism on a red meat diet for a couple of months. The result was that everyone in the group experienced a lessening of symptoms, and supposedly, the group that consisted of kids below the age of 6 had some participants who got rid of their symptoms entirely (mild symptoms, I assume). I'm really excited to see what more they discover as carnitine is being further studied. It might turn out to be a real game changer for animal-based diets!

We used to be able to eat them yes... It's a curious mix of habit, & fatigue (- because she won't take the supplements that would help her cos she thinks it's too many or doesn't like the taste), and her meds and diet cause brain fog- my opinion is that she probably has more allergies than she realises too... living in a stress-zone (she's a magnet for a lot of stuff and people who are hard work, so I personally limit my time with her out of a sad necessity)... being inobservant and a bad listener and not being in a zone where she personally feels like she has to read all the labels - though She should, being a coeliac and she used to, I learnt how to from her.

She knows what happens to me. I lived with her when it started happening... yet she is the reason why I know that you can't look after others unless you are looking after yourself properly.

In short my good hearted mum is a person who is totally codependent/ self love deficit disorder, who is running around after everyone else trying to take care of them, but not successfully looking after her own biggest needs.. but thankfully she is getting some help for that again these days.. From my observation of her, getting help for the codependency self-love-deficit issue is never a one and done. It always slips back or creeps in. Another lesson from watching her behaviour; Others should never give you your worth, or between your own ears, you become a total mess...

l7av2ob,t1_l79bt2e,1d6lyij,"Well, I'm middle aged now... I would get frustrated with some of these things as a child: She'd constantly put herself down, all lies or things that I now guess came from hyperfocussing on one thing rather than looking at the big picture. She would not have let any of us talk to anyone else like she did to herself... I remember being utterly furious and so confused as how do you defend someone from the bully when it is themselves, their own words?! My attempts as a child never worked.

 I (much) later realised that you won't change someone's mind just by telling them the truth if they are super attached to their own inner dialogue about it.

The verbal self body shaming she did was the next one I got frustrated with as I noticed it was not what she said she wanted to teach me, she must have read something to me about self image, I don't know how I would have known that the parents self image was meant to be something that their children could copy safely... I saw it was self defeating lies which didn't make sense. I only ever did a diet in my teens to appease her, but I totally recognised that she was trying to save me from the way she'd been bullied by subjecting me to the same attitudes and ideals, which was crazy and illogical, but I promised myself that whatever weight I ended up being, that I would love myself and not do the diet yoyoing that I saw for weight loss -I also realised that one day I would be able to choose my own foods. Portions she served were gigantic too, so in my teens when I was not having growth spurts, I would grab half my tea and take it to school to have for lunch the next day, as the portion size was immense - as a result I was well fed for both meals... Meant that I was able to cut the gluten that made me feel ick. Mum only cut 'all white foods out' if she was trying to loose weight. But in my teens I could see that she was clearly intolerant to some of the same things as me, only she didn't listen to her body's needs. Essentially she trained me to be a fat girl, and I chose different ways and didn't end up that way, because of some sort of nutrient absorption issues that I had from birth -in hindsight - I took after my dad there... but I had an expectation and peace with if I became fat but I unexpectedly had to work out how to juggle the unexpected opposite and put and keep on weight.

kqj2jew,t3_1ar7jq6,1ar7jq6,"Two things happened.  

The reduction of carbs to near zero turns off the ""store store store"" signal.  That constant cellular pressure is reduced. 

The reduction of inflammation allows cells to do what they are supposed to do.  Cells do not want to signal pain to the brain.

So the best way I can describe what you and others are experiencing is a lack of the constant feeling of pressure.   Pressure on the brain, joints, organs, blood flow etc...

lsetk7u,t3_1g5t4zd,1g5t4zd,"Why would you go back to eating ""normal"" if you experience alleviation of symptoms on carnivore?
The suggested mechanism (that I have read of) is that you have running inflammation non-stop while eating plants, which means you have constant levels of anti-bodies going around.
 When  you quit plants for a while the inflammation goes away hence you don't have antibodies in circulation at all times and ingesting something triggering causes a bigger reaction because it takes time to activate the immune response that might dampen it a bit again.",

I use an app to record all of my calories (Myfitnesspal app - subscription required), and I set it to 70% fat 30% protein. I set my target weight in the app, and it tells me how many calories to eat each day. It also accounts for exercise by giving you more calories. I generally put 300 G of pork belly in each baggie. I buy beef chuck roast, and I cut it into steaks and tenderize it, and I put 200 to 270 G in each baggie. I vary between chicken wings and chicken thighs and legs and try to stay in that same 300 G range.

I hate the taste of liver so to get the liver in my diet that is needed I take chicken liver grind it up and mix it with hamburger mix in some bacon and some spices a little bit of Parmesan cheese and make little balls out of them and freeze them and then I cook them about every other day. I put three little balls in a freezer bag. Yes, I know grammatically,  that was a horrible paragraph, sorry. Edit: Forgot the pulverized pork rinds

I cook all that stuff in the air fryer, and it's really simple.

Sometimes, I'll eat eggs because you need eggs. I try to incorporate boiled eggs and scrambled eggs as much as possible.

After you've been on the diet for a month go in and get tested for all your vitamin and mineral levels to find out where you are explain to the doctor what you're doing so you will get all the right tests. You're probably going to find that you're lacking in some areas, and this will allow you to adjust where you need to. For me, I needed to eat more liver and supplement with vitamin C.

Go to a butcher and buy beef fat trimmings and cut them into 1/4 in strips season them how you like and air fry them till they're slightly crispy. This will help you get your fat content up. I eat a lot of pork belly, but I get it at Costco, and it's quite lean, so I need to add some more fat back. A lot of people add butter. I just can't see myself eating sticks of butter.

 You're going to have a lot of things change for you. For example one of the big ones for me was I used to need seven and a half to eight and a half hours sleep no matter what now I can't sleep more than five and I feel fully rested every time like I've had a cup of coffee before I even got up.

Oh, and bathroom time is not going to be fun for the next month or two while all the gut Flora you no longer use dies off.

I hope this information helps it's what I discovered along my way and what I'm still experiencing. Good luck to you.",

Some of the early and most successful carnivores (Stefansson, Donaldson, Stanley) all forbid the use of salt and believed it caused people issues and was, ultimately, unhealthy. Carnivores in the animal kingdom do not consume salt. That's an herbivore trait.

In my experience, it seems like lightly salting food to taste rarely causes issues.  Anything beyond that is often a problem. Less is better. Personally, I have gone months without salt, and find that it's really not much different than lightly salting. So, I will lightly salt many foods, for taste.

But, even meat cooked to medium is just fine for avoiding scurvy. And, unless you're only eating meat that has been cooked to death and dry, it's not a concern.

Cook your meat how you like it. Less cooking is best, and most people will move in that direction, but raw is not required and no one is forcing people to eat meat that is dangerously undercooked.",

it was contingent upon conditions -- it was useful when eating mixed diets with fowl.

in the north, when animal foods were plentiful, liver was thrown to the dogs.

and yes, if people like it, they should include 3 - 4 oz a week, avoids problems. 

sometimes people are starting with low iron and deficient in other nutrients, due to previous malabsorption from their GI condition or die to their prediabetes, T2D. In those cases, it falls under ""take supplements as prescribed until the deficiency is cleared up"". Liver may be the only supplement needed. 

If the iron or B12 deficiency is more severe, and they need supplements or IV treatments, liver still helps woth the ansorption & utilization of iron and B12 supplements.

If so, how do you prevent all the smoke alarms from going off? If you are cooking meat at appropriate temperatures then you should not have a lot of splatter. If you are, then turn down the heat. If it's just happening when you're searing the steak, which is valid, then wear a cooking apron for your slacks. If you wear long sleeve shirts then you might get a bit of splatter, but if I'm going to sear on high heat I just pull off my dress shirt. You can also use an air fryer and completely alleviate all of this and it does a great job of cooking and it's very easy and quick. 

**When eating:** you are probably eating with poor posture. Sit at a table, sit up straight while cutting your food, then lean forward and take the bite with your mouth over your plate. Then lean back to an upright posture while you chew and swallow. Repeat until you have finished your meal.

It‚Äôs called an apron and eating with utensils with your mouth over the plate üòÇ

Seriously you should invest in some good Aprons cooking carnivore is not any more difficult than any other type of cooking üç≥ it‚Äôs all about your ingredients, prep & execution.

Watch some cooking videos about preparation getting your space right, using the right cooking tools and methods. You shouldn‚Äôt be getting lots of grease on your clothes you might have your heat source too high and might be using too much oil.

ü•ã (As for the stains on your clothes old fashioned methods still work if you don‚Äôt have stain remover to quickly spray your stained clothes try quickly using soda water and baking soda with a bit of detergent it‚Äôs basically the same ingredients as the over the counter stain removers acting fast is important otherwise your clothes are probably permanently damaged. On a positive note in the absence of an Apron you can now cook in your stained clothing )üòÇ

Worth pointing out that nutritional epidemiology doesn't always find a correlation between red meat and colorectal cancer, ""Red and processed meat isn't associated with colorectal cancer in Asia, where it's a health food and food of the wealthy rather than the poor."" -- George Henderson comment on this study, https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/10408398.2018.1495615?journalCode=bfsn20
Or ""the incidence of colorectal cancer was significantly higher among vegetarians than among nonvegetarians."" https://academic.oup.com/ajcn/article/89/5/1620S/4596951?login=false

Don't ever let people dictate your lifestyle choices based on their good intentions!

The road to hell is paved with good intentions. 

Your positive experience should be more than enough confirmation that eating a carnivore diet is what works for you.

Since no one is living your life for you, they shouldn't interfere with your choices, especially your dietary choices as they do not have their skin in the game. 

What is good for them cannot be thrown out there and universally accepted as good for everyone on this planet. 

They do not have any competence to talk about nutrition, nor do they have the courage to try it out for themselves and subconsciously they feel bad for this and somehow, they feel as not being enough and they feel left behind. But not one of them will ever admit to this, as it takes a certain level of maturity and integrity to do so.

And to counteract this, in their laziness, they chose the easiest route which is to detract you by various tactics, so that you can get back to their level so they can feel good about themselves.  And all of this is done more or less unconscious. 

99% of this planet's populace behaves like this.

Therefore, you could do yourself a big favor and listen to your gut. When did you feel better?  On the carnivore or the standard diet?

Always listen carefully to your body.

l2lgtcx,t1_l2ldc8i,1ck6czt,"There are a cluster of diseases which appeared in populations when the storage foods were introduced, chronic diseases we tend to think are a normal part of living and aging. Whether the populations were eating omnivorous diets or diets wholly of animal source foods, they did not have these chronic ""western diseases"" until the storage foods came along.

Go through the medical anthropology, start with the references in Gary Taubes' Good Calories Bad Calories, pp 89 - 99, the Diseases of Civilization chapter.

Here he is talking about that research, at the 12m55s-17m30s section of Biomed Central Metabolism, Diet and Disease Conference, The Obesity-Cancer Connection Panel, : https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EffpuKqWWF8 (the section starts a minute and a half earlier, at the 11m30s mark, talking about insulin sensitizing)

Burkitt & Trowell's work -- ""Diseases of Westernization"" includes some of the observations about the variation in the presence of chronic diseases between different populations. Burkitt mistakenly thought it was the fiber that made the difference, even though he knew about Inuit experience and that it was similar to the other H-G groups: that the chronic western diseases (incl cancer) were rare to non-existent on their traditional diets before the introduction of the storage foods. He omitted the Inuit experience when forming his hypothesis because he had a preference for the fiber hypothesis. But despite a diet of little to no fiber, Inuit also did not have the chronic Western diseases until the introduction of storage foods.

A more coherent hypothesis would have been that the addition of the storage foods was the problem and the fiber, if it did anything, was an improvement only because it displaced the storage foods. (that hypothesis is more coherent, but also not a great hypothesis, because fiber can make things worse, see: https://www.reddit.com/r/ketoscience/wiki/fiber. If you go through Burkitt's lifetime of research, it wasn't convincing for the fiber hypothesis, the idea was compelling, but the outcomes were not.

The eggs could be very cheap or very expensive due to the fluctuation in prices, but if it's too expensive then just don't buy them. They aren't necessary, they're just more of a perk.

The bones get really soft so I grind them up and put them in the dogs food. 

Either that or a whole chuck roll for about 4.79 lb that I cut into thick roasts. We bulk buy meat from Costco to save money. I break down the big chuck roll myself. The lamb comes ready to thaw in a bag. I just pull enough for two and out the bag back in the freezer.

If you live in a city in the developed world then they may have their own versions of ‚Äú Costco‚Äù where you can buy meat in bulk. I would ask a butcher in the meat department of one of those type of stores. 

If you live in a rural area then I would go to farmers markets and get to know any body who seems like they sell meat or grow animals. Buying direct from a farmer or rancher could also work for you.

I tend to steer towards carnivore although sometimes I trend towards keto. One thing's for sure this is the only, and I mean ONLY thing that has made me lose weight.

Most of my initial PCOS improvements came with keto. But on carnivore, I have more energy & mental clarity, better digestion (literally like my IBS is 99% gone) & my hair is getting fuller again after having thinned a little over time. Cycle is regulated & painless (most of my adult life was without a period).

I honestly am not 100% sure when my hair got fuller, I only just noticed it in the past couple weeks... my hair seemed frizzier, & then I went to re-dye it & noticed as I was lifting sections to apply color that I had *a lot* of short growths that weren't there a few months ago. They are like 2-3 inches long & fully my natural color, so it isn't just weird widespread breakage (thankfully lol).

I feel *fairly* confident it coincided with my transition to stricter carnivore... however, when I did the switch, I also increased my calories quite a bit: my protein didn't change much, but carbs went to near 0 & I stopped worrying about regulating my fat intake.

- Wakes up at 4:30am every day with a pep in his step
- His optometrist was BLOWN AWAY that she had to REDUCE his eye glasses prescription after decades!
- Has to cut his blood pressure pill in half, IF he feels he needs to take it that day (has gone some time without it now) because his blood pressure has been so perfect you‚Äôd think he‚Äôs 20
- Easily building muscle mass
- Had to turn down his hearing aids (like you said, better hearing/less wax)
- Chronic knee joint pain has disappeared
- He claims that, at the beach, he didn‚Äôt sunburn like usual (he was there sitting in the sun for 2 weeks)

- Thicker hair
- BEAUTIFUL skin

If you happen to get a private consult with a doctor that promotes carnivore, which I have, and you still have medical issues, the solution is going to be: cut back on the fat/extra calories exercise more/add strength training.

You just end up paying thousands of dollars and hear the same thing: fix your food, exercise more, more strength training. And every time you pay $250 or $300 for the consult you will hear that advice, until it finally sinks in. So then I noticed my blood pressure started going up and got another consult. Result: Hey, there's a lot of fat on your liver, you need to cut back on fat and exercise more. And it worked! Had I done that to start with I could have avoided the problem and saved myself the money. 

Yes, they are selling a ""program"" but it's just so that the message sinks in. If you want I can just tell you what the are going to say and you can save the money and ignore the ads.

keep in mind, this is different than a stanard diet, on this way of eating people maintain muscle and bone density even when sedentary.

the advice here and of the longest runninig zerocarb forum, Zeroing In On Health, is to wait until you feel like exercising as a sign of restored health.

there are a few reasons for this

- one reason is that exercising too early can worsen some conditions. there has been a lot more awareness of this since longcovid, eg https://longcovid.physio/our-work/who-long-covid-rehab-guidelines, but other communities (ME/CFS, MS) knew that exercise was not always a good thing.

- another reason is that it takes energy and resources in order to fight infection and illness and to repair damaged tissues. (resources meaning the fatty acids from fat and the amino acids from protein)the damage can be considerable -- eg for someone with a GI problem, the surface area of the GI tract, including the villi in the intestinal tract, is the same as the surface area of a tennis court! (per Dr. Alessio Fasano, expert in celiac disease). Another example is burn patients who require about 7500 calories a day for the restoration of tissue. Obv less serious conditions don't require as much, but needing to balance intake and exertion while the body is restoring tissues is a real consideration. Having the impulse to exercise is a great sign the body is ready to shift into a new gear and the person should be mindful of needing to eat more when they first get back to it.

- a third reason is that the inflammation and higher histamine levels that come with exercise (which is normal and productive, part of how the body recovers from exerise and how the stimulus of exercise gets converted into being more adapted for it) can aggravate the person's health condition. Whether it is from dietary histamine or the histamine in the post-workout session, it gets added to the baseline histamine levels and tends to go where the inflammatory fires were already burning. Some people will do it anyways, if its minor, like a mild flare of their skin condition. But people recovering from, say a painful GI condition or migraines, won't want to deal with it quite yet. They can find a level of exercise where it is better, not high enough histamines to trigger a reaction, or just wait.

- for people who are very heavyset, the work of moving around their frame is plenty of stimulus and finally, on this diet, that can be converted into muscle and bone density gains. their previous types of diets prevented that (there can be sarcopenic obesity). they don't need to force exercise, but also should wait until the impulse to do it arrives. the general experience is that it is sometime after 6 months - 1 year on this diet and have lost some weight. Again, while not doing forced, deliberate exercise they are getting lots of stimulus just from moving their extra weight around through their day to day.

***

tl;dr this way of eating should be studied for the way that muscle mass can be maintained even when sedentary.

when I started I was very sedentary because i had a severe anemia, yet went down a size at the same weight over my first 7 months of doing this way of eating, eating heartily.

had another period of being sedentary, years into this way of eating, when i had longcovid. when i went back to the gym after 18 months, my lifts were where I had left them. that didn't used to happen even on a keto diet.

the newer influencers don't know this, the poorly moderated sites and subreddits about carnivore don't know it either.

but the one that have been around a while and helped thousands do.",

And if you are worried, if what they say is getting to you, then it might be because you haven't done enough research on this diet yet. In which case you should. Contrary to the ""just eat meat and shut up"" mentality some people propagate, it's always a good idea to properly educate yourself on anything you do. To fully understand why this diet is much healthier than a standard one. So if you're unsure if too much protein might really be bad for you in the long term, or that high cholesterol will kill you, or of anything else that random people might throw at you, then you should look into those things. Understand why those things are not a problem. If you do then you should have no problem ignoring those kind of remarks. And you'd actually be able to educate some people who are open minded enough about how our diet really affects us.

And I'd wager that people would stop giving you their uninformed ""advice"" if they got to see that you actually know what you're doing. Instead of just trying out this crazy diet that you're heard about on the net. If you can explain to them why all of their arguments are invalid, then they won't bother bringing up more of them. And some of them might even decide to try it out as well.

So educate yourself. On everything that matters to you. And if there's people who are stuck with any beliefs and just don't want to hear anything you might have to say, anything that goes against their beliefs, ignore them. Those are generally not people you'd want to get involved with anyway. If it's someone close to you then they should at least know to keep their opinions to themselves, after you've made it clear that you're not interested and don't appreciate them trying to lecture you.

And your results are going to be the proof in the blood pudding, eventually. If you are still eating poorly, high-absorption chemicals as in Coke or megacarby pastries or anything else that's not recognizable as an actual food, then ask us about cravings and finding balance.

In short... You're 47 fkn years old. Put up some boundaries and tell your people to respect them. But with an open heart...meaning be ready to have answers to their questions. It's nice they are concerned but if they can't articulate the truths about cholesterol perhaps they should assume you are right and then see if they can do some research to show they are correct. This can be hard if your people are little ones, too old, not the type that seeks education, or not very invested in anything but being the correct one.

That said, true sprinting, on toes and as fast as truly possible, without a very serious warm up, has always left me injured with pulled/strained muscles in quads that hurt for days.  Contrast with various length interval runs, first/last quarter mile all outs, hurry home runs, etc.  Giving O'Mara a listen, other suggestions or resources are appreciated.",

I run on a elliptical twice a week sprinting intervals. Once a month I'll jog a hilly trail.  I like it too much and see results such as heart rhythm, blood pressure, and many cardiovascular improvements. I  do weight lifting 2 days but have physical lifestyle so I have 3 work/recovery days. 

I have great(similar) weight loss results but I'm still trying to eat as much as possible(no fasting) cause I truly feel my body is still healing and feel 1% better every day and probably wont stop eating as much until 90 days in.

My much larger Ninja XL (with a more powerful motor) just can't do it for some reason and the final product comes out really ""grainy"" and rough.

I use a Cuisinart glass jar blender but most do the pulse button to keep the heat from friction to a minimum.
I stop and empty the jar into a large wooden bowl and repeat through the rest of the dry pieces... The texture of the blended meat is powder plus fibrous and contains an occasional small clump the size of peppercorns perhaps. Once I pour in the warm (not hot) tallow slowly in the equal weight of the bowl, mixing and stirring with a wooden spoon... The end result is similar to dry oatmeal perhaps, I spread it in the Pyrex dish, then I always sprinkle some coarse salt and sometimes add strips of cold Bacon and allow it to adhere to the soft surface before covering with parchment paper then plastic lid and cool it right down overnight.

l7s30g6,t1_l7rx3bu,1daorc3,"Yes of course!

When we started we had 1kg of meat each ready for us to consume. I also tried to have a variety of things because when you‚Äôre transitioning to carnivore you think you‚Äôre missing out on variety but it‚Äôs just a mind game really.

So my breakfast is always, always, bacon and eggs. Cooked in bacon fat, with butter added for taste. Salt and pepper seasoning. I drink 3litres of electrolyte water a day. I do still have a coffee but it‚Äôs an espresso with some steamed milk or heavy cream. No sugar.

Lunch is usually a ‚Äúsnack‚Äù. This could be jerky, boiled eggs, or cheese chips. But if I‚Äôm not hungry I just wait until til dinner (which tbh seems to be what my body is enjoying.)

Dinner is steak with butter, and I always have something else like a fried egg or a few bocconcini balls or sour cream or something. 

We have ribeye, rump and eye fillet, brisket from beef. We do pork belly, loin chops and pork mince. Chicken breast and thigh, salmon and wild caught snapper. Eggs. Cheese, sour cream, and a dash of milk for coffee.

We eat bacon, eggs and steak every day. We alternate with another protein for those meals as mentioned above.

Additionally, our bodies have naturally moved to a fasted model. We eat breakfast at noon, and by 6pm we‚Äôve finished eating.",
l7s2fqq,t1_l7rtfoo,1daorc3,"When we finally stopped eating sugar all together it was a solid 4-5 days before the cravings totally went away.

It then made me realise my ‚Äúhunger‚Äù was false and just a sugar craving. Once all that stuff from the sugar gets out of your body you could sit in a lolly shop and not even blink if someone shoved lollies in front of your face. That‚Äôs how stark the difference is.

I found that during this phase when I thought I was hungry and went and grabbed one of my snacks I actually wasn‚Äôt hungry at all. I then waited and waited until my body was really hungry. Many hunger signals came a good 3-4 hrs after that initial sugar one. If I ate during the sugar hunger I would take a bite and then be like, ‚Äúwait, I‚Äôm not even hungry.‚Äù

The studies they use are very flawed. They use unreliable questionnaires and then associate meat with foods like lasagna, pizza and hamburgers ignoring the carbs and processed foods, just to push their agenda.

A lot of this health junk science started with the SDA (Seventh Day Adventists) and their ""nutrition"" organizations like the ADA and Loma Linda University.

There is no scientific evidence meat causes the health issues they claim. Hong Kong and Japan are a few of several good examples of healthier eating including lots of meat and eggs and longer life and less health issues.

> the unbelievable vast majority eat 1-3 lbs depending on body weight.

This is exactly why we don't want advice for teens, because this is the impression people have, and it's horribly wrong for adults. It's worse for teens.

Absolutely no successful, long-term, weight stable carnivore is eating one pound a day. That amount is insufficient for anyone. Even the tiny old post-menopausal woman, who is trying to lose weight, needs at least 1.5 pounds to get proper nutrition and still lose. Everyone else needs more.

As for a man? A man trying to go from 210 -> 165 lbs was prescribed the following **weight-loss diet.**

>I had told him that some executive ability was a great help in weight reduction, and because he was the chief chemist in a large organization he must have some of that quality. For fifteen weeks he would be required to eat enough of a big fat steak broiled with pepper, but no salt, and a demitasse of black coffee, to show a gain of at least one half pound on an accurate scale directly after completion of the meal. That probably meant that a porterhouse **steak should weigh about one and a half pounds to begin with. This meal was to be eaten three times a day.**

Personally, I eat about three pounds a day to remain weight stable. I often plan around buying two pounds of meat, because I don't count eggs/cheese/cream in the pounds. And, I will just go buy more if I need it. I don't get in to specifics, but I am not a very large person and my physical activity levels are very similar to carnivores with periods of intense activity followed by long periods of rest. It's why I am very comfortable telling the people who are running 5k each morning and doing 5 intense hour-long workouts a week that they're tired because they're eating way too little at only 2-3 pounds a day.

People come here with calories and restriction on their mind and don't know how to eat to just be healthy and maintain weight.

Then we get in to the fact that teens are burning excess calories through growth and change. They do need more and on the higher end of the calorie scale. A teen eating 2 pounds a day, because that's what an adult with a suppressed metabolism said was right on the internet, is going to end up sick and undernourished. And, anyone eating a pound a day, even if they want to lose weight, will get sick and fail.

l10v85h,t1_l0zs072,1cbjfaq,"yes. but this diet *is* anabolic, in the sense that people gain muscle and increase bone density ¬†on it.¬†

But teens need so much more food.¬†

And what we know of traditional cultures, the first stage of growth there is the anabolic insulin stimulus from nursing that goes along with the meat & fish eating.¬†

There's that plus not knowing how traditional cultures handled those years after weaning for kids and teens -- eg did they prioritize berries in season for them. gathering lots and letting the kids & teens have most, the way we give more fruits and starches to our teens? growth spurts are seasonal, would the availability of berries and other carbohydrates correlated with those times and supported the growth spurt? Were there organs they knew fast growing teens did better with when they were included because of the extra nutrition?¬†

tl;dr, afaik yes, kids need to be on an anabolic diet¬†",
l151qm0,t1_l12iyde,1cbjfaq,"I don't know exactly how big you are. So for you that might be a good weight loss amount. I tend to agree with Donaldson in the sense that to really lose weight you have to keep stoking the furnace. And he recommends that you eat three relatively equal sized meals each day to do so. He recommends about 700 calories minimum for each of those meals, and encourages you to eat more at a meal if you feel like it. That he says will keep your metabolism high and burning all that food, while maintaining an adequate amount of nutrition to keep your body at optimal pace.


One thing I recommend everyone eating this way look at, is the Minnesota starvation experiment. You'll see that they took young men and put them on diets of 1600 to 1800 calories a day, and not a high level of activity. And they did this for 24 weeks. The effects on their metabolism and on their mental state or dramatic especially with how negative those effects were. These diets were also low in protein and high in starches and carbohydrates. Very similar to your conventional weight loss diets. People put themselves on these diets and then expect to be able to do that for a year to lose weight and wonder why they get so sick and the metabolism goes to hell.


Eating less is a fool's game.


When I was losing weight eating carnivore, I was eating about 1,800 to 2,000 calories a day without even trying or tracking. And I was losing weight faster and easier than when I was eating 1500 calories a day on your standard diet. And I found after eating the standard diet, that I would gain weight if I was eating 1800 calories or more a day. It had lowered my metabolism to the point where I couldn't eat normally. Like I mentioned the other post these days, I eat approximately 3,000 calories a day and maintain my weight without a problem. Some days I may eat more, and some days I may less. But I always eat way more than people expect.",

For two, the way of life involved a lot of work. Stefansson found that they were robustly healthy, he tells of one of the guys they were travelling with running beside the sled for the 24 hour journey.

Some of the hunting involved long trips of tracking. And once the catch was found, there was work to gather it and bring it back. Seals, they are hundreds of pounds. 350 - 700 lbs or so and have to be pulled out of the water and then transported all the way back to the shelter.

The demands of hunting also involved explosive energy and they had games and ways of training for that. One of them is jumping up, starting from a kneeling position -- emulating what's necessary when you are hauling in a seal and polar bear comes along to steal it and you have to jump out of the way.

Their day didn't involve driving or strolling to the grocery store to pick up a couple pounds of beef in climate controlled environments.

From one of his accounts, the group that stored up weeks and weeks worth of fatty fish and bags of mammalian fat to have during the coldest times, when it was -40 - 50 and stormy, they would eat less as the temperature in the igloo was quite comfortable, and they were sheltering indoors, not hunting.",

This is exactly why we don't want advice for teens, because this is the impression people have, and it's horribly wrong for adults. It's worse for teens.

Absolutely no successful, long-term, weight stable carnivore is eating one pound a day.  That amount is insufficient for anyone.  Even the tiny old post-menopausal woman, who is trying to lose weight, needs at least 1.5 pounds to get proper nutrition and still lose.  Everyone else needs more.

As for a man? A man trying to go from 210 -> 165 lbs was prescribed the following **weight-loss diet.**

>I had told him that some executive ability was a great help in weight reduction, and because he was the chief chemist in a large organization he must have some of that quality. For fifteen weeks he would be required to eat enough of a big fat steak broiled with pepper, but no salt, and a demitasse of black coffee, to show a gain of at least one half pound on an accurate scale directly after completion of the meal. That probably meant that a porterhouse **steak should weigh about one and a half pounds to begin with. This meal was to be eaten three times a day.** 

Personally, I eat about three pounds a day to remain weight stable. I often plan around buying two pounds of meat, because I don't count eggs/cheese/cream in the pounds. And, I will just go buy more if I need it. I don't get in to specifics, but I am not a very large person and my physical activity levels are very similar to carnivores with periods of intense activity followed by long periods of rest. It's why I am very comfortable telling the people who are running 5k each morning and doing 5 intense hour-long workouts a week that they're tired because they're eating way too little at only 2-3 pounds a day.

People come here with calories and restriction on their mind and don't know how to eat to just be healthy and maintain weight.

Then we get in to the fact that teens are burning excess calories through growth and change. They do need more and on the higher end of the calorie scale. A teen eating 2 pounds a day, because that's what an adult with a suppressed metabolism said was right on the internet, is going to end up sick and undernourished.  And, anyone eating a pound a day, even if they want to lose weight, will get sick and fail.",

m3dwfos,t1_m3ds0de,1hkcl3p,Rendered fat can be bad for some people‚Äôs digestion.,
m3dyqz9,t1_m3ds0de,1hkcl3p,"Lol. This is not normally how burgers are eaten, so for people new to the diet (which I‚Äôm assuming OP is) it might not occur to them to pour the fat back on top of the burger. Further more pouring liquid fat on top doesn‚Äôt always guarantee that it stays on top of the burger and makes it into your mouth which is why some people let the rendered fat cool & solidify to smear on top of the burger or eat as is. Again, might not be something that occurs to people brand new to do. 

Also again since in general eating rendered fat is not a way of eating most of us are accustomed to it can take time for newbies to get used to. NBD and no need to be rude either.",

m3i04w0,t1_m3dr440,1hkcl3p,"I've accidentally discovered a delicious way of eating all the render left in the pan... So im cooking patties (in tallow and butter mix) which fall apart easily because no flour in the mix... I lift out the nicely cooked patties and then I leave all the lumps and bumps of the beef patty detritus in the render.. I make sure there's plenty of meat left in the pan.
Then I pour that into a square glass dish and put it into the fridge. When it's hard I cut it into squares and snack on it. It's so delicious especially when I've used chilli and paprika seasoning with salt and white pepper. I do it when I've chopped up left over cold beef or lamb to fry up also..
 I leave a good portion in the pan to make the tallow snack because it's difficult to eat plain chilled fat, and the little chunks of meat taste wonderful surrounded by all that fat. Just sayin",
m3dzl6d,t1_m3dr440,1hkcl3p,"You *can* but in my experience when the fat is still liquid it doesn‚Äôt really stay on top of the burger that well and just spills off onto the plate. So I typically let the fat cool & solidify then smear it on top of the cooled burger (so it doesn‚Äôt reliquify). I smear butter on my burgers too, on one side goes butter on the other side goes the cooled tallow. Delicious.

If you‚Äôre too impatient to let the fat cool you can always use it as a ‚Äúdipping sauce‚Äù or something. That‚Äôs what I do on the rare occasion that I want a piping hot burger.

Mainly suited for pan frying as grilling will be a cluster\*\*\*\* unless you have a broiler, which works pretty well but I like the pan the best. Make a good cream sauce afterwards with all the fat.

Slice it thinly, season/marinate it overnight, stick it in a low oven or dehydrator for several hours. Stupid simple. Lean meat is best unless you refrigerate it because the fat could go rancid if it's room temp. 

I have made Crack Jerky (Youu Tube) but without any sugars (if it even had any, I can't remember the recipe). For carnivore, omit any and all seasonings you don't feel comfortable with including.

It's really easy. Freeze the meat first (top/bottom round is a great cut) to firm it up for easier slicing.

Alternatively, biltong I believe is a fattier version that's more carnivore friendly. Usually just salt, maybe pepper if I recall correctly. Look up some recipes and see for yourself!",
