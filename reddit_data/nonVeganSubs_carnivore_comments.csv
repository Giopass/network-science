kv12jjh,t3_1bfjyi4,1bfjyi4,Congratulations you’re a super star! ⭐️,⭐
kv13l2u,t3_1bfjyi4,1bfjyi4,Hell yea brother,
kv47acr,t3_1bfjyi4,1bfjyi4,"That’s awesome. Myself 4 weeks strict carnivore and now adding eggs and fish. Tired first 3 days, then an insane energy boost. That disappeared after a week and had on and off days. Taking care of the right supplements electrolytes for me, now back on track. Needed 8 hours of sleep before and still tired after waking up, now after 4 hours I’m sharp as a knife and keep going for rest of the day. Bodyfat to 9%, shredded as a mf. Kept my training on point with discipline even though some days was so tired (2/3 times a week). This is the key guys, experiencing any difficulty in life mentally or physically—> be strong and do strict carnivore for 1 month then see how you feel",
kv1izwm,t3_1bfjyi4,1bfjyi4,"So glad to hear your doing better! I’m curious if you’ve told your doctor how you’ve improved and if so, how did they react?",
kv198pk,t3_1bfjyi4,1bfjyi4,Awesome 😎,😎
kv2e38r,t3_1bfjyi4,1bfjyi4,congrats! i'm interested to read about your recipe rotation,
kv28emb,t3_1bfjyi4,1bfjyi4,💖,💖
kv1a79u,t3_1bfjyi4,1bfjyi4,"Your numbers are so similar it’s scary. I started at 306.6 although I began on January 8th and I’m down about 43lbs since!

My A1C was out of control and very high and it went down to 6 after a month (tested in February). I can’t wait to see what it’s like in May once 3 months pass since the last test. 

Interestingly my liven enzymes normalized after just one month while both AST and ALT were high due to my fatty liver prior. Crazy considering how much fat I’m eating. 

Congrats and good job!",
kvc3f1f,t3_1bfjyi4,1bfjyi4,"So good to hear stories like this, Congrats!!",
kvc4s6n,t3_1bfjyi4,1bfjyi4,"Nearly the same.  Long Covid sufferer, got up to 325.  Started eating only beef as an elimination diet due to Histamine Intolerance.....I didn't even know Carnivore was a thing.  Three months in and I am down to 288 and feeling MUCH better.  I have been taking blood tests every 3 months for a couple years as they try to fix the LC.....After 2 months of Meat/Fish only diet blood tests showed lowered Cholesterol, Inflammation, and Glucose....Even cleared up my liver function......The doctor that wanted to put me on 3-4 New meds won't return my calls after she read my blood tests and I told her how I got there.",

kvegjiw,t3_1bfjyi4,1bfjyi4,Anyone have any info on T1D and carnivore? Been wanting to try but just not sure how and where to start.,
lasaiag,t3_1bfjyi4,1bfjyi4,Looking forward to hearing any updates. I hope you have continued making progress on carnivore,
kv75wyf,t1_kv47acr,1bfjyi4,Carnivore. This is the way.,
kv2sjuu,t1_kv1izwm,1bfjyi4,"I told my doctor I’m eating “a low-carb, medium protein, high fat diet.” He high-fived me and told me he’s glad I embraced keto. He wanted to give me statins because my LDL was two over recommended. I told him we’ll hold off. 

He is a great doc who works to cure people from type 2 diabetes with diet. We don’t agree on meds (he wanted to help me lose weight faster with Ozempic) but I appreciate his support.",
kv1kuwv,t1_kv1izwm,1bfjyi4,"I'd love to hear that too cuz I'm waiting to hear that, ""this diet will kill you"".",
kv2tycs,t1_kv2e38r,1bfjyi4,"We keep things simple because my wife joined me in this WOE. We rotate between:

- pot roast with the yummy broth 
- cheeseburger casserole 
- steaks: ribeyes or strip loin
- flanken ribs (Korean style ribs) these are short ribs cut crossways in thin strips
- bacon and eggs with hamburger patties
- ground beef with fried eggs
- a tin of sardines 2-3x a week
- bone broth 3x a week
- 5% Greek yogurt when I want a little something something. Usually my dessert on game night with friends each week. Not more than once a week. 

I supplement with LMNT and berberine. 

This keeps things fresh. We usually eat once day.",
kv75q1n,t1_kv1a79u,1bfjyi4,The same to you. I marvel at how quickly our bodies respond to good nutrition.,
kv5jh53,t1_kv4ktl3,1bfjyi4,"He did not. I was lurking here before my heart event and was fixing to start but got interrupted. He is not opposed and like my GP, recommends keto over the American Heart Association’s heart healthy diet. He’s also the one who explained that the heart’s preferred fuel are long chain fatty acids, like the saturated fats in red meat.",
kv75hm9,t1_kv5t917,1bfjyi4,"Some. Loose for the first week or so. Now, they are less frequent and reduced in volume. No gas or bloating.",
kvzl0lp,t1_kvzi24w,1bfjyi4,Today is a good day to begin!,
kv5ith9,t1_kv38cii,1bfjyi4,"Fatigue, getting winded walking up from the basement and chest pains. The chest pains increased with time as my health deteriorated. It happened fast over 3-1/2 weeks.",
kvbyqdt,t1_kvb3gco,1bfjyi4,"I responded to an earlier comment with what we rotate for meals. I generally eat once a day so I defrost a couple of choices to have ready. Flanken ribs, ribeyes, ground beef with eggs are my go tos. I like things simple",
kvjj0wp,t1_kvegjiw,1bfjyi4,"YES! Well more keto than carnivore but a book called Diabetes Solution by Dr. Richard K. Bernstein literally changed our lives (T1D diagnosis 15 months ago). He is a T1D himself and a huge advocate for low carb, high protein, and normal blood sugars. He has a YouTube series called Diabetes University. Also Facebook groups like typeonegrit and letmebe83 have been very helpful. 
We primarily use R insulin now to match the slower BG rise from protein/fat, and basal is probably half of what it was at diagnosis. God bless! ",
lbhpnsn,t1_lasaiag,1bfjyi4,"Thank you for asking!

As of July 3, 2024, I am at 277. My blood sugars remain at a consistent 105 average. My skin is clear, and I have gained enough energy to begin a daily calisthenics workout.

I had a setback regarding my heart. I received steroids in April for a respiratory infection. They wreaked havoc on my body. My blood sugars went ape crazy - over 287 the first day! The course also caused my heart to go into AFib. The first episode lasted over 4 days.

A long story short, I had an ablation procedure in early June. My recovery has been steady and solid. I continue to eat carnivore. I am certain if I was not doing so, my life would be vastly different right now. My body is recovering. One benefit of the surgery is that my bloodwork confirms my trend towards health. My cholesterol, my blood sugar, etc. all show a healthy baseline. First time in a decade.

Of course, I wish I had lost more weight, but I'm optimistic. I am getting stronger and healthier, bit by bit. While not as fast as I prefer, it's in the right direction!",
kv768l0,t1_kv1kuwv,1bfjyi4,Had a friend who is a nurse tell me to be careful cause saturated fats will kill you. I sent her a link to a study affirming the heart’s preference for long chain fatty acids as fuel. Silence.,
kv391is,t1_kv2tycs,1bfjyi4,i was thinking of buying some canned tuna. but isn't canned tuna/sardines processed?,
kv9u4yl,t1_kv2tycs,1bfjyi4,How do you prepare your flanken ribs?  I have some in the freezer and my husband says they look like dog bones.,
kvcaicl,t1_kv2tycs,1bfjyi4,Why only eat once a day? Would 3-4 times be too much on this type of diet?,
kv73glo,t1_kv5jh53,1bfjyi4,Well that’s great man. I’m glad you survived your heart attack and I’m very happy to learn your cardiologist and GP are supportive of a real heart healthy diet.,
kvzl1v4,t1_kvzl0lp,1bfjyi4,SONS OF ODIN CALL,
kv5jwac,t1_kv5ith9,1bfjyi4,Thanks— glad you’re ok now,
kvcjjyk,t1_kvbyqdt,1bfjyi4,thanks. will read this subs more,
lbli9m3,t1_lbhpnsn,1bfjyi4,"while recovering, there is a mild, productive state of insulin resistance --- itpart of how the body restores and repairs tissues. while that is ongoing, there will be less or no net lipolysis (drawing down from your fat stores) 

sorry about your respiratory infection 😣 but glad you got the care you did (is it too much to say it sounds like it was lifesaving! 🙂) and be patient about weight loss, there's a lot going on right now with your healing. 

one benefit, since you say you have the energy to return to calisthenics, the mild IR (insulin resistance) within the context of the low and stable BG and insulin of carnivore, can help with increasing muscle, repairing muscle tissue after lifting. focus on how you feel, your energy levels, and your exercise/strength gains rather than the scale :) ",😣🙂
kvc3q5e,t1_kv768l0,1bfjyi4,"It’s amazing isn’t it. How can they just be so blind and ignore the amazing results that come from it.
Hopefully someday they will embrace it help to understand why it works so well, and figure out even more facts about it.",
kv5ik6g,t1_kv391is,1bfjyi4,"I buy water packed with bones. They’re gutted and canned. Ingredients are sardines, water, and salt. That’s it",
kv5ap9l,t1_kv391is,1bfjyi4,"Tuna contains quite a bit of mercury, but it probably fine once a week. There's nothing wrong with sardines. Mainstream media will, of course warn you about sodium and cholesterol, but you know better. Just get the ones packaged in water if you are against vegetable oils and mustard",
kv5ods7,t1_kv391is,1bfjyi4,Try mackerel,
l86yaup,t1_kv391is,1bfjyi4,I prefer canned salmon. Better flavor and nutrition imo,
kvby6ib,t1_kv9u4yl,1bfjyi4,"Lay them flat on a baking sheet. Cook 40-45 minutes at 350°. Salt and enjoy. That’s how we do it. 

Flanken ribs are short ribs cut crossways. Nice and fatty with a rich flavor. Our packs at Costco come 6-8 a pack. We each eat a pack for a meal.",
kvcnu3k,t1_kvcaicl,1bfjyi4,The basic rule of carnivore is eat when you’re hungry until you’re comfortably full. I generally don’t get hungry but once a day,
kv75j98,t1_kv5jwac,1bfjyi4,Me too!,
lblj0im,t1_lbli9m3,1bfjyi4,Thank you for this information and the encouragement,
kvbytkm,t1_kvby6ib,1bfjyi4,Thanks!,
kvd1ldd,t1_kvcnu3k,1bfjyi4,Interesting. I’ll look more into it.,
lodhc6e,t3_1fmqti3,1fmqti3,"Common believe is that carbs are a must. I’m tired of it. Yesterday I participated in a bike race, 140km and 3500m elevation gain, totally fasted, just water and salts. It took 6h and all my other friends all loaded carbs night before, the carbs all time during the race and then the after race carbs meal to recover, because carbs are essential for recovery 🤣🤣🤣

I just keep silence and do my job, eat meat. It is impossible to debate on it. And I’m sure if you are not a fat burner, you need all that carbs, but being fat adapted is just the best approach to endurance",🤣🤣🤣
locr6oq,t3_1fmqti3,1fmqti3,"Loved hearing about this when you did the podcast rounds. It’s really impressive. The criticism most often levelled, however is that zero carbers lack power for sprint work. I am happy doing long (30+ mile) bike rides fasted on my own, but I can appreciably fade on group rides when everyone else is smashing gels!",
lod321w,t3_1fmqti3,1fmqti3,"When do I get this energy skyrocket effect, you think?

Edit: still waiting, probably doing another fasted marathon before he replies",
lod09iv,t3_1fmqti3,1fmqti3,Nice!  Kudos to you. I’ve done 22 mile hikes/rucks fasted with more in the tank. That’s around 8 hours. Only thing slowing me down is my feet. They get sore after that long.,
locs3fy,t3_1fmqti3,1fmqti3,I saw the podcast/video with Anthony Chaffee.  Pretty incredible.,
loeewry,t3_1fmqti3,1fmqti3,"Video was amazing, you’re an inspiration.",
locszcy,t3_1fmqti3,1fmqti3,I was telling someone about this the other day! Good stuff good stuff,
log8a2f,t3_1fmqti3,1fmqti3,"I bet [Pheidippides](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pheidippides), who ran about 500 km in 4 days, wasn't eating carbs all day.",
lovudaj,t3_1fmqti3,1fmqti3,"This is amazing! I'm thinking about doing an ironman 70.3 but I suck at swimming, but I wanna do it and do it fasted!",
loyy3dv,t3_1fmqti3,1fmqti3,"What does your daily food intake look like? Do you do one meal a day, two? Are you tracking macros (% of calories from fat)? Thank you",
ltwam05,t3_1fmqti3,1fmqti3,How much do you train per week? And what do you typically eat in a day?,
m7nstv2,t3_1fmqti3,1fmqti3,I too ran a marathon on Carnivore. Felt good. I love the discipline and mental fortitude it taught me.,
loggywy,t3_1fmqti3,1fmqti3,"It’s not that carnivore is inferior to carbs, it definitely is better, it’s just nearly impossible for a regular person to stay away from carbs completely, unless you have iron will and want to miss out on 90% of culinary and beverage endeavors.",
loef4r7,t1_lodhc6e,1fmqti3,"How long does it take to get fat adapted? Do you usually eat more the day before a race? After a failed attempt at carnivore, I'm easing into it by doing keto this month and had a fell race last weekend and bonked after 4 miles. 

My plan is to attempt carnivore again next month for 30 days. I'm eating 80% carnivore just having a few nuts each day. Although my mental health has definitely improved, my running performance has definitely taken a nosedive.",
log47lk,t1_lodhc6e,1fmqti3,That’s brilliant! Congrats. 💪🏆,💪🏆
log4ny0,t1_locr6oq,1fmqti3,Yes the comment that carbs are essential for high intensity is the next stage to be addressed. There are examples of world class athletes doing high intensity on zero carbs. Ryan Talbot is just one such example and competes in the decathlon for team USA. He runs a 10.6 sec 100m on zero carbs. I’ve spoken to him about this. He has similarly impressive results in his other 9 events.,
log4xkw,t1_lod321w,1fmqti3,"Generally it takes 3-6 weeks to get the initial boost of being fat adopted. After that the benefits increase over subsequent months as you become better at converting fat to energy

(Apologies for keeping you waiting!)",
log53l7,t1_lod09iv,1fmqti3,Outstanding. Yes becoming fat adapted solves an energy problem but it doesn’t make your body invincible. I wore my ankles out in my 5 marathons,
log4yit,t1_locs3fy,1fmqti3,Thank you,
log3x1h,t1_loeewry,1fmqti3,Thank you,
log54vt,t1_locszcy,1fmqti3,Thank you,
loery1z,t1_loef4r7,1fmqti3,"As a fellow distance athlete (runner + like to lift), I'm wondering this too. From what I've gathered from this sub and /r/carnivorediet, folks often claim 90 days or thereabouts.

I am only on my third week (today is day 15) and, while I feel fantastic overall, my usual workouts feel more taxing and I lack ""vigor"" for lack of a better way to describe it.

I'd be very interested in hearing OP's thoughts.",
loek8rm,t1_loef4r7,1fmqti3,"I’ve adapted gradually. I like training early morning, so always trained fasted for the last 4-5y. For the Long trains I used to take some fruit with me to load at the middle of the train. I started low carb by reducing refined carbs, and I tried to stretch the training to be fasted for longer, to a point I can do a long trains always without any food. Actually, I eat as much as it is needed to feel satiated, and never consider if next day I have a long session. I took like 6 months to get adapted. I read the book “The Maffetone Method” from Phil Maffetone, the lesson learned is that there is an optimal HR range to promote fat burning. This book I fully recommend, is a life changer. When I started carnivore, I was fully adapted to burn fat, but carnivore is not necessary for that matter, but it helps as it is zero carb way of eating.",
lomwkmd,t1_loef4r7,1fmqti3,It took me 3/4 months to get to about 90% athletically. That last 10% was elusive. Probably took a full 9 months. Your experience may vary.,
lordblm,t1_log4xkw,1fmqti3,"Cheers man, can't wait to get adopted by fat!",
lomc034,t1_log53l7,1fmqti3,"It’s funny, Once you feel what your body can do being adapted, you will never go back. 

Keep it up.",
loex7uh,t1_loery1z,1fmqti3,"I recommend the book ""The Maffetone Method"", definitively, this one helped me a lot. Idea is training at a heart rate on the lower side of zone 2, considering the typical 5 HR zones. This correspond to an effort where you can maintain a conversation, or breath through the nose. If you follow this, you will improve your aerobic capacity, so no need to chase vigorous efforts",
lohgc5c,t1_loery1z,1fmqti3,"Yes definitely feeling the same. Just trying to motivate myself by listening to podcasts on this WOE. It seems to make sense and I really want to experience the supposed benefits. Unfortunately I do have a few races here and there and although on training runs I'm not killing myself I do have to push myself on the races. Feels like I have nothing in my legs. I have said I will do 30 days next month but like you have said 90 days seems to be the amount of time everyone says you need to give this WOE to reap the benefits. 

I have a race next weekend so I will maybe try upping my fat leading up to it. It's hard to know how much to eat really.",
lonfjxx,t1_lomwkmd,1fmqti3,Thanks for this. Helpful to have some numbers and to accept the fact that my performance is going to get worse before it gets better. It's good to have some realistic numbers on the timeframe so I stay patient and committed.,

Early on I had a big drop then jt slowed down considerably.   I would lose,  then go a week or two without much progress on the scale etc.  really the last 6 weeks is when my Sleep really improved and the weight feels like it’s dropping steadily now.

I know early on I wasn’t eating enough while adapting which I think was causing my issues.  Heck I had a two week period where I had nearly no appetite and the thought of eating anything was nauseating.    I’m glad that passed because I almost gave up.",

lajk0wl,t1_lajhswu,1dpu005,"I keep it simple,  nothing unusual from a Carnivore perspective,  but the regular meals will look like:

- Ground Beef cooked with diced up pieces of bacon.

- Steaks on the Grill topped with Kerry Gold to finish

- grilled burger patties with fried eggs and bacon

- Scrambled Eggs with Bacon

Kerrygold included in some way with most meals.

Lots of Salt.   I do use Ground Pepper.

I also add bacon or eggs to meals as necessary depending on my hunger levels.

I occasionally buy Chicken Thighs and bake them in the oven.   

I’ll occasionally treat myself with Chicken Wings from Buffalo Wild Wings (with Buffalo sauce)

Occasional Bone in Porkchope.


I also buy these Sausages from CostCo I forget what they are called.   They don’t have a lot of filler in them I think I heard about them on this forum.   But it’s a good change of pace on occasion.",

l9jbp0d,t3_1dj69f1,1dj69f1,"Hey! Wonderful to hear how far you've come on the diet! Thank you for taking the time to share your story. I'm not sure if you're still answering questions, but have some if you're up to answering them.

A very brief background: I'm a 150 lb, 6'0"" (slender) 37-year old, who has been working through chronic illness of the body, that predominantly feels nestled in the sinuses/face/brain/throat (feels like a thick toxic film is coating all of it). I gave up on Western approaches long ago (all they prescribe are antibiotics, steroids and proposed surgery), and I have been at the herbal/supplemental drawing board for years with my naturopath.

I tried carnivore once, but only for three weeks. It was difficult to note any discernible shifts in that small window of time, but I gave in eventually because a) I wasn't pooping at ALL and had to resort to enemas, and b) my body seemed to be craving carbohydrates as an energy source, so I felt sluggish, tired and weighted down. I was conscientious about my electrolyte intake.

My questions are:

1.) Did you have any bowel issues from the get-go?

2.) Did you purchase store-bought bone broths, jerkies, etc.? I ask because it seems like most of the store-bought stuff has other ingredients like celery, garlic, etc. for taste.

3.) From your personal experience, do you really see carnivore diet as an elimination diet, in that perhaps there are deeper, energetic or physiological needs to tend to for your body to not react so strongly to various herbs, plants and the like? In other words, do you feel the carnivore diet truly sustainable, or can the diet be looked at as a temporary fix (like any other elimination diet) while needing to attend to greater issues at play? I feel as if I might know the answer already based on your journey, but am curious to hear your thoughts.

4.) With the information you've collected over the years, do you think EVERYONE should be entertaining a carnivore diet, or do you feel it's just based off one's constitution, genetics, biological makeup, etc.?

5.) Do you find it important to seek out meat that is organic, grass fed, local, etc., and have you noted any differences between those kinds and cheaper store-bought stuff?

6.) What was a day-in-the-life meal plan for you in the first couple years?

That's all! Feel free to answer some or all (or none!). Thank you again for sharing your story and for being open to answering questions. Apologies if any of these have you repeating yourself, or if they come off as naive.

Much gratitude.",

So 75/day x 2 weeks, then 50 g/day x 2 weeks, etc, etc. You can easily go more slowly if needed. at 50g/day I started eliminating heavy starches (pasta, rice, bread, potatoes) and by the time I was down to fewer than 20g/day for awhile, it became a non issue & just cut out all but carnivorous foods.

l9dk3b9,t1_l9b0q4f,1dj69f1,"I enjoyed brain and organ meats at the early stages of my carnivore diet.

I don't know how much of my results are because of organ meats and brain.

Probably most important thing is the fact that I was not eating plant toxins and sugar.

But I had a feel that brain is good because it's literally neurons. So it should have everything my body needs to heal and rebuild the damaged neurons.

The other thing I did was supplementing with vitamin D and magnesium.

My recovery took years of being consistent with everything and doing lots of self experimentation.

Now 8 years later I feel like I'm 99% recovered. And not only having had GBS doesn't hold me back, but it also changed me in a good way. Now I'm a different person who's ready to take on any challenges life has to offer and take better responsibility for the things that matter to me. If I left my health and recovery for the doctors and didn't take the responsibility of my health to my own hands, I wouldn't have made as good of a recovery.

I'm highly confident that strict carnivore is a really great base diet to start with for managing in recovering from most autoimmune conditions. But it's not a magic bullet. You have to do a lot of experimentation to figure out what works for you and what doesn't. It's not a replacement for proper treatment of the acute onset of the disease. (it doesn't replace IVIG and ventilator when you need them)

Dr. Shawn Baker, Dr. Paul Mason, Dr. Anthony Chaffee

I had the plateau for a year or two and didn't improve further.

Then I started keto and after a month or two I started seeing progress. But progress stopped after a few months.

I was keto for a year and improved a lot and started Carnivore.

With Carnivore improvement was fast and everything felt good. My body and mind was screaming and telling me that this is the right way to feed my body and mind. I never felt as good as I felt on carnivore in my whole life.

There are a lot of success stories online. I'm open to sharing my experiences online. Though I don't know what I have to add to what already exists out there.

l9o6a51,t1_l9jbp0d,1dj69f1,"1) I had bowel issues before Carnivore. In the past I was either constipated or had diarrhea. When switching to carnivore it initially got worse and I diarrhea for a week or two. Then my bowel issues completely resolved.

2) I made my own bone broth and tallow, for jerkies I sometimes found things that where pure beef and salt. But it's hard to come by such things. And I usually prefer to just eat half cooked fresh meat rather than old dried products.

3 & 4) After years of living this lifestyle I think it's the way we're supposed to eat. Any other way of eating is not natural. It's like putting diesel in a petrol car. It may work, but I don't even want to try. All the evidence points out to the fact that historically our ancestors were hyper carnivores. I think Carnivore should be the default standard for everyone and any other form of eating should be the exception. And it's actually better for the environment and more sustainable to eat grazing ruminants.

Most people would get sick in the long run if they don't regularly consume animal based fat and protein.

5) Get what you can afford and what is accessible to you. Store-bought grain-fed meat is significantly more nutritious than anything that isn’t animal-based. If you can easily get grass-fed meat from a local rancher who treats the animals well, that would be optimal. However, don’t let perfect be the enemy of the good by not eating meat just because you can’t get the best quality.

6) usually two meals a day. I don't have a preplanned eating schedule. I just start eating when I get hungry and stop eating when meat no longer tastes good to me because I'm too full to be able to eat more. This usually leads to two meals a day for me. But sometimes one meal or three to five meals a day. And my meals are whatever is available and I like, which is usually steak and BBQ. I don't restrict my eating or count macros. I eat all kinds of fatty meat that tastes good to me. If you want to have an idea of how much food I'm eating in a day, I'm 65kg/143lbs 173cm/5'8"" and I eat 1 to 2 kg of meat a day. (2.5 to 4.5 lbs). Many people do Carnivore to loose weight, I gained a lot of muscle while on carnivore and it involved a lot of eating and consistently training.

The chronic health situation can be so draining and dejecting.  I may have mentioned it, but I am a freelancer and self-employed, and am mobile quite often.  So I think one of the most difficult things perceptibly holding me back from this full-fledged diet is having consistent access to it.  And eating on the road, or in restaurants, one must be very careful with the cross-contamination of other elements (i..e, gluten).  But there's so much at steak (intentional misspelled pun :), and it's evidently so worth it in the long-run to go all in.

I suppose one follow-up question I have is a hybrid of questions 1 and 6, which is, how much did/do you emphasize fat intake, particularly in connection with having better bowel movements.  Did you use lots of tallow starting out, or butter/ghee?

Ah, and you may have answered this in your initial post, but how long did it take you to start feeling legitimate benefits once you went full carnivore?  I mentioned I had a three-week stint with the diet, but it didn't seem long enough for me to gauge bonafide benefits.

lara8d3,t1_lapzazl,1dj69f1,"I was keto for more than a year when I started carnivore, so my experience and take on it is a bit different than people who may go straight into carnivore.

Because I was coming from keto, I was used to eating a lot of fat. So just eating by taste and cravings worked for me. If I craved more fat, I ate fattier things and if I craved more lean things, I ate more lean.

For most people after a lifetime of everybody screaming that fats are unhealthy and we should limit fat intake, at the beginning they tend to just under eat fats if they go by taste and cravings. Because they’ve never experienced eating enough fat consistently for a long time, so they have no idea of what fat cravings and eating enough fat feels like.

I experienced this in my early weeks of keto and had to intentionally eat lots of fat.

I have some rendered fats like tallow and ghee that I sometimes use in cooking but I don’t use it as a main source of nutrition and fats. I use it because I’m pan frying something and don’t want it to stick to the pan.

For getting fat I just eat fattier cuts of meat. And a delicacy I enjoy eating is BBQing lamb/beef fat cubes in a skewer. I would cut the fat into half inch cubes and use a narrow steel skewer to cook them over charcoal. The exterior would turn crispy while interior is moist.


For me seeing noticeable results from carnivore was fast, because I was already fully fat adapted to being with.


Humans are supposed to always be in ketosis and that’s our bodies primary metabolism. 

Unfortunately modern diet and lifestyle keeps people on sugar metabolism all the time and many people rarely experience their bodies primary mode of metabolism.

If someone has put their body through that kind of abuse for decades, they have some catching up to do with their bodies, metabolism and developing a healthy relationship with food. For some people this may take weeks, for some it may take months or even a couple years for the body to recover from all that abuse.

Nourish your body for a long time with what it’s supposed to be fed, and give it some time to recover from all those years of eating what your body didn’t want to be fed with.

It’s important to eat the right things, but it’s way more important to not eat the wrong things.

Our bodies are made up of the things we’ve been eating in the past years. When we stop eating inflammatory and poisonous things, they don’t just go away. You’re just not adding to what’s already there. It will take years for the body to recycle itself and replace all those tissues with newly built tissues.

And things like oxalates may even stay in the body for decades.

And even after all tissues are recycled, there may be some damage that's not going to easily go away.

For example sugar, if you stop eating sugar, after a few days your body has already got rid of all the sugar. But the inflammation, oxidative damage to the tissues and insulin resistance is here to stay for a while longer.

It's fascinating that we're constantly feeding our bodies the wrong things and it's always fighting ti get rid of them and our body still sort of functions after all that abuse.

It's only after we stop feeding the body crap that it tries to get rid of, that it gets the space to put it's resources into things other than trying to get rid of crap.",

Targeted Carnivore, settled for keto if I could get it, and may not technically have.  Nevertheless, ALL my numbers except LDL got drastically better, and I dropped from 323 to 258.  Doctor congratulated me, asked what I was doing, and threw a fit when I told him.  He was a doctor and put himself through college and med school by being a personal trainer...he knew it all about diet, etc, and essentially ordered me to start eating carbs again.  Being a former carb addict, I went off the rails, so to speak.

By the next appointment, I'd regained 58 of the 65.  The doctor threw a fit again!  He then darn near forced a psych consult on me because I must have become mentally ill to have accomplished so much but blown it so quickly, but I decidedly, calmly, and consistently indicated (as in there was no way I was ever going to leave him out of my story) that I simply followed his instructions and that, if he has a carbohydrate addict (a fat person with the associated health issues and prescriptions) for a future patient who manages to get himself all but completely off carbohydrates, let him!

“Similarly, Poropatich et al., [11] found that anti-TPO and/or antithyroglobulin antibody titers were present in only 50% of the patients with euthyroid, cytology-proven Hashimoto thyroiditis, a finding never reproduced by these or other authors in the literature. Given the wide range of normal values for TSH (1 fold) and the variability on the presence of TPO autoantibodies, it is conceivable that early Hashimoto's autoimmune process might be clinically missed. These issues, together with the awareness that sub-clinical and clinical hypothyroidism associates with cardiovascular and neuropsychiatric morbidities, make finding high prevalence of Hashimoto thyroiditis on cytology, especially in euthyroid patients clinically significant [12-14].”

This study demonstrated that subclinical Hashimoto’s maybe as prevalent as Type 2 Diabetes, where previously it was thought as prevalent as Type 1 (this is discussed earlier that what I quoted).  

I share this to encourage you to keep advocating for your health and wellbeing.  Take care.

Facts are that other than new cropland being opened up, say, in the Amazon, which has nothing to do with most of us here in the western world, you can actually make an argument that each cow raised for meat removes carbon from the atmosphere. 

To start with, cows do not ""create"" carbon. They get it from their food ie plants. Plants get carbon from the air. Yes, some of the carbon that the cows return to the atmosphere is in the form of methane, but likewise, some of the carbon captured by the plants also came from methane that was emitted years past. So, the whole thing is an almost net zero cycle. The almost part comes from the fact that the meat, bones and hide of the cow also contain carbon which is captured ie not returned to the atmosphere. That is roughly 100 lbs of carbon per cow. 

So, eat more meat and save the planet.",

lt2ug6m,t3_1g8w02p,1g8w02p,"So many many things!   (Obligitory I'm not a doctor, this is not medical advice, these are just my opinions and observations).

First, there is a direct moral/ethical component.  Lots of people these days grew up adjacent to Meat=Murder and totally believe that to their soul.  Vegans feel morally justified to do all kinds of things in the name of meat being murder.

Second, there are scores of online health/wellness/lifestyle personalities that make pretty controversial claims about diagnostic data, standard of care regarding diabetes, psoriasis, PSA, RA, IBS, various communicable viruses, blood pressure stats, lipid blood panels, preventative medicine, and much more.  I believe a lot of what these doctors have to say, especially since I've been able to reverse my Psoriasis and PSA symptoms down to nothing this year with carnivore (obligitory N=1, your results may vary, etc. etc.).  The problem is, your doctor will do a couple of blood tests, take one look at your LDL cholesterol levels and flip their shit.  They don't know anything about keto or carnivore, they just believe your heart is about to explode, regardless of what your other scores look like or how well you are improving otherwise.

Third, related highly to the second, Some carnivore enthusiasts and online personalities happen to take political positions.  Those positions tend to be right of center.  I don't think it's controversial to say that generally, Reddit, most advertisers, and general internet culture has their political compasses dialed in to at the very least to the left of center.  Everything gets politicised, especially on an election year.  I think it's sad that academics, science and medicine have been dragged into the political arena because it doesn't serve the public to do so but here we are.  ""Jordan Peterson Bad"" so ""Carnivore diet Bad too"". It's just the way things are now adays.

Fourth, I'm pretty sure if everyone went Keto/Ketovore/Carnivore, (fanfiction incoming) the entire western economic system would burn down or at the least we'd have a supply chain crisis that would throw the marketplace into chaos.  Grocery stores wouldn't be able to sell the vast majority of the products available on shelves, you'd be buying and raising your own chickens the moment you could get a coop built, people of means would be buying freezers full of beef from local ranchers before it was too late.  The price of insulin, GLP1 inhibitors, statins, and other drugs would shift to bottom dollar, most people would become skeptical of their doctors as they would feel misled for a lifetime.

I’ve eaten carnivore for many years because of significant medical issues, and my doctor encourages it, because it works for me. 
I think the other reason, is people have assumptions based on what they see, read, etc, and have a hard time letting go of established views- but truly, there really isn’t a “one size fits all” with nutrition. It’s dependent on everything from health and genetics, medical history, energy consumption, and a million other things, along with beliefs about animal welfare, etc. Eating this way works wonders for me, and makes my life much easier.

Im on mesalasine, its a low impact anti inflam, proabably the best of the worst. Non invasive, side effects are rare. But also its known for not working very well.

updating: 

Scratch all that, I found it. 

The look she was going for, very low body fat, that's not something we promote here. 

Looking at pictures of women from all sorts of hunter-gatherer cultures, all around the world, even when the women are very lean, they have more of a fat layer on their arms and stomach.

Similarly with the women I know who have naturally lean physiologies -- it runs in their family, they can eat lots of anything. They are size 00 and elegantly lean. They have more of a fat layer. 

Our cultural trend of very low body fat -- trying to look like sprinters in season or bodybuilding bikini contest levels of leanness -- is not a healthy trend. 

Women often attain that leanness through cico & exercise (and some will then get surgery to fill back in the areas where a woman would have more healthy firm fat tissue, like breast tissue. 

For the immune system, it's good to have a normal healthy fat layer, and there's aesthetic benefit to having more breast and hip fat tissue.

lgcqaix,t1_lgcipu6,1ej329t,"It's a common perception.  I know why it exists, because I have been behind the scenes for both subreddits.  The tl;dr summary is that people mistake ""passive"" moderation with ""permissive"" moderation and ""active"" moderation is mistaken for ""restrictive"" moderation.

r/zerocarb has had active moderation for a long time (more than 10 years).  For a while, we had a decent sized team (for the size of the subreddit), and we could be making 60-100 moderation actions a day. Now, we're down to two moderators and the automated actions remain high, but we have done our best to reduce the need for manual actions. If you posted something, there was a very good chance it would be reviewed by a human and responded to. If it was borderline, we might ask you to make some changes. There were frequent visible messages on the subreddit about posts/comments being removed for rule violations. But, we allowed coffee, tea, non-caloric sweeteners (discouraged but allowed with moderation oversight), drugs, raw (when I had time, since I was/am the only mod that eats any significant amount of meat raw), etc. If it was aligned with Stefansson, the Bear, ZIOH, and/or Donaldson it was allowed.

r/carnivore was being run by one moderator, who was not active. He set up very strict rules. No coffee, no tea, no mushrooms/drugs, no sweeteners, etc. He then added an automoderator script that caught a bunch of words that would show up in posts that broke these rules. Posts/comments with those words would be filtered and go to the queue. There would be no notice that the post was not visible on the subreddit. And, it could be very counterintuitive to figure out if your post was up or not. It would seem like a lot of posts were going through, and they looked up from the poster's perspective, but they were not live on the subreddit.  The mod rarely, if ever, reviewed the queue. When he brought other mods on board for help, we found thousands of posts/comments that went back over a year. Many of those didn't break any rules. And, there were tons of rule-breaking posts/comments on the subreddit that just happened to not be caught by the filter. Those weren't removed because the mod wasn't reviewing anything. It seemed a lot more permissive here, even though the rules were much stricter and many posts were being silently removed. When compared to the number of members, more posts/comments per member were removed on r/carnivore than r/zerocarb.

For example, if you posted, ""I never drink coffee."" It would have been manually reviewed on r/zerocarb and then approved. There's a chance you would have known we were reviewing it, but we were online often and it may have been up in less than a minute. On r/carnivore, it would have gone to the blackhole of the mod queue and never seen the light of day, even though it was completely aligned with the rules. But, you would think it was up.

If you posted, ""Drink a couple cups of coffee when you are constipated."" It would have been removed on r/zerocarb and we would have asked you to make it more of an experience and less a recommendation. We might ask if you could reference The Bear or Donaldson (both who suggested coffee helps increase bowel movements). It would likely eventually make its way up on the subreddit. On r/carnivore, it would silently vanish and you'd never know it wasn't up.

We also had strict rules about referencing other subreddits, selling advice/supplements/etc, and referring to people who give non-carnivore advice as experts in carnivore. A lot of people were frustrated by those rules.

So, yeah, it seemed more relaxed because the mod never responded to anything, your posts always seemed to go through, and the filters were not perfect so rule-breaking posts were pretty commonly visible.",

they just don't want people to talk about their non-zerocarb diet on the subreddit.

it even says, ""don't confuse the moderation of a subreddit with life advice""

before, ppl used to come across carnivore only after already doing very low carb.

now, there's lots of people trying it out who, frankly, would get the improved health and body composition they are looking for by doing an old school low carb diet and mods have put that in the Getting Started and will tell redditors who haven't tried that first to do so, they'll say that directly in a reply or in modmail.

l0q07dy,t1_l0pky7a,1c9q8cu,"it's that it has become normalized to have big sugary snacks in between meals ('coffee' is basically a milkshake etc, ppl have big sweets along with it) and in the US, for the meals, even when people think they aren't eating sugar, a lot of the savory food -- sauces, bread -- has sugar in it. 

It's really hard to get food without sugar in it in the US, other than buying meat and vegetables and making it yourself, and they start giving kids piles of sugar from the get go and constant snacking. Speedrunning the problem, so a proportion of children are getting T2D (what used to be called afult onset diabetes) and more have fatty liver.  

Ben Bikman describes the way the snacking + sugar creates insulin resistance here, 5min section 20m45s - 25m45s, in his talk Mechanisms of HyperInsulinemia 

https://vimeo.com/896716494

Happening everywhere, but the way there is no restraint around sugar in the US but the opposite makes it worse than elsewhere. It is unusual behaviour to seek out products without it. Most ppl don't read labels on their savory foods to avoid it, they'll get whatever at restaurants, even eg hipster restaurants where the food looks more artisanal and natural has hidden sugars. 

Also, mechanistically, the seed oils along with sugar accelerates the fatty liver damage.

Think of carnivore as long term. You will need to give your body the time and space to detox and to heal and repair. Also, make sure you maybe transition slowly. Do low carb with meat that’s not strong in taste. So maybe fresh fish like snapper or whiting, and meat like chicken and some pork cuts.

ldyuchk,t3_1e6lrew,1e6lrew,"You'll have an easier time if you transition slowly, especially if you've never been in ketosis before. I'd shift to eating only meat over 2 to 3 weeks. I would eliminate all grains and seed oils to start, then ease off fruits and vegetables to make the transition to ketosis easier. Replace one meal a day with only meat for a week, then two meals for a week, then eliminate the fruits and vegetables. Slowly transitioning will help build up the right bacteria in your gut. Doing it cold turkey is a recipe for disaster pants.

Some meats should always be fully cooked, while red meat is often eaten rare or uncooked in the middle. I suggest you start with fully cooked meats as they will digest easier. If someone is cooking you a steak or burger, make sure it's well done. You can shift to medium or rare later. Meat requires more chewing. Start with small bites. Too big of bite makes your body feel like it's too much with the desire to spit it out. Start with the size of a sugar cube if you struggle. Meat will also chew easier if you cut it across the fibers: more work the knife, less work with the mouth. It can take your body a while to adapt to digesting more fat if you've been eating low fat (most vegetarians have been). I wouldn't worry about adding extra fat in the beginning.

You might hear about fasting, but given the condition of your body, you should not fast. Instead I would suggest eating as much as you can tolerate to give your body the nutrients it needs to heal.

I would suggest limiting poultry and pork as they are often fed garbage diets. I would also limit chicken breasts and roasts as they have very little fat. The body needs fat _or_ carbohydrates and cannot function just on protein. As a carnivore diet has almost no carbohydrates (eggs and dairy have some), you need fat. Eggs and dairy are common allergens so you probably want to eliminate those.

If you really want to turbocharge things, go for the ultimate elimination diet of beef, water, and salt. The body needs far less vitamin C when not eating carbohydrate, and there is trace amounts in meat. If you find yourself low on vitamin C, liver is a good source (tip: liver needs to be not be overcooked to not taste awful, so requires cooking very slowly to cook all the way through).

You are indeed eating dead bodies. Be thankful for the nourishment given to you by the animals. Most animals raised for food live much better lives until the time of slaughter. Slaughter is a kinder death than they would get by being attacked by a wild predator.",

End with broccoli as it has a decent amount of protein for a veggie. Eat as much organ meat or organ supplement pills.

I started with rabbit, then chicken, pork, beef... I was already able to eat eggs, cheese, fish, seafood. However, I found i had a mast cell condition after my last colonoscopy. And I reacted badly to eggs, chicken, turkey, and nearly all plants by then. 


I wish I hadn't been encouraged to use bone broth, cooked low and slow increases histamine, or aged/fermented/canned foods, high in histamine. Ground meats have more surface area and are higher in histamine. My functional medicine doctors kept encouraging me to reintroduce different plants and herbal supplements. I also became reactive to most of my auto immune meds. 


After eating mostly meat for the last two years, my inflammation went down and I was able to start aquatic therapy to get stronger. As I had begun falling down all the time about 9 years ago. 
My list of health issues is nearly countless. Although, my lupus/RA seems to be doing better. We'll be checking my lyme disease this week. My hashimoto's is bananas for the last 4 years. I also treated positive for so many viruses, bacteria, parasites, amoeba, etc. that my gi doc laughed and said you'd be in the hospital. I glared at him and said which time? Bc they won't keep me. My EDS hypermobility is improving on sea lion diet. 


What I eat now, beef (boneless ribeye, picanha, top sirloin, beef fat; must be non aged and freshly butchered from butcher; grocery store beef makes me sick), and less frequently beef liver(i wouldn't eat liver as a child then a veg until i became carnivore, now it's delicious), scallops, flounder, steelhead, lobster tails, mussel meat, Swiss cheese freshly sliced unaged, kretschmar American with no soy... I have noticed that I am not satiated as easily with fish or seafood as I am with beef and beef fat. The key to lower histamine is fresh, freshly frozen, or freshly freeze dried. Grain/grass fed doesn't seem to affect me. 


I did give up coffee and tea and herbal tea. I had issues with pain so was using alcohol and mmj to help with that. I'm still on a little mmj for sleep and cigarettes. Hopefully, I can stop them soon. Even with a dirty sea lion diet, I lost over 70 lbs and a ton of inflammation in the first 6 months. People comment now that I don't look like my photos anymore. Now I don't sunburn, I just tan. Exercise is easier now. I didn't exercise at the beginning. When the inflammation goes down, exercise might become possible again. I keep having to buy new leggings, bc my lifelong chunky thighs shrank so fast the first year that they'd fall to my knees when I stood up. Some days they stay up, others they simply don't. Drawstrings are your friend. 


Being Veg nearly unalived me. Carnivore is saving me even though it's taking longer bc of how sick I'd gotten. I was 345lbs when I stopped weighing myself or taking photos. Now, I'm around 182-195lbs depending on my dairy intake. 


If you try rabbit and chicken first, maybe try digestive enzymes. But your body may do fine with ruminate meats. So allow for your body to tell you what is reacting to. Also, liquid carnitine seemed to help me a lot before i started eating meat again. I'd also suggest collagen, if you're into supplements. ",

le32pbo,t3_1e6lrew,1e6lrew,"Hey there,

First off, I want to commend you for being open to exploring new ways to improve your health. It sounds like you’ve been through a lot, and I truly hope you find some relief. Transitioning to a carnivore diet from a lifelong vegetarian diet is a big step, but with the right approach, you can make it smoother and more manageable.

Here are some steps you might consider:

1. **Start Slow**: Begin by introducing bone broth and meat-based broths into your diet. These are nutrient-dense and can help your body start adapting to animal products without being overwhelming.
2. **Choose Mild Meats**: Start with meats that are generally easier to digest, like chicken or fish. Ground meats can also be less intimidating and easier to handle.
3. **Incorporate Organ Meats Gradually**: Organs like liver are incredibly nutrient-dense. Start with small amounts, maybe mixed into ground meat dishes, to get used to the taste and texture.
4. **Stay Hydrated and Monitor Electrolytes**: Transitioning diets can sometimes affect your hydration and electrolyte levels. Make sure you're drinking enough water and consider supplementing with electrolytes if necessary.
5. **Listen to Your Body**: This is crucial. Your body will guide you on what it can handle. If something doesn’t feel right, don’t push it. Adjust and find what works best for you.
6. **Seek Support**: Consider working with a healthcare provider or a diet coach familiar with the carnivore diet, especially given your health conditions. They can provide personalized guidance and support.
7. **Mental Preparation**: It’s normal to feel repulsed or uncomfortable initially. Acknowledge these feelings, but also try to focus on the potential health benefits and improvements you might experience.

Remember, everyone’s journey is unique. Be patient with yourself and give your body time to adjust. I wish you all the best on your path to better health.

Take care,

IMO these are all manifestations of the same disease but that’s another story. Sure I will try to update. 

Do you mind if I ask, did the biomechanical quality of your joints improve too? For me I have pain but the worst bit is the cartilage has diminished and this has left the joints loose. It’s not hypermobility rather more like if you took out the spaces out of a nut and bolt. There’s essentially ‘space’ in the joint. It’s causing be a lot of problems…. 

Cartilage supposedly doesn’t regenerate (for a number of reasons) but I do wonder if it might do so under certain conditions, albeit slowly… especially when the autoimmunity is extinguished.",

If you don't, I'd keep a log of food and symptoms/reactions. It can be hard to keep the details straight, especially when in pain or not feeling well. Having it written in a simple format or even captured in photos of meals with notes re: symptoms will simplify things.

Better if the new food is later in the meal so it passes through slower, given more time for the right bacteria to grow. The burrito idea someone mentioned is not bad.",
ldywcuq,t1_ldxhyas,1e6lrew,Liver isn't necessary. Lots of carnivores don't eat it. I personally think of liver as medicine as it's the most nutrient dense food humans eat. Too much liver can lead to vitamin A toxicity. The limit for humans is about a pound a week.,

le6n199,t1_ldxj9sj,1e6lrew,I find bacon and chicken about the only things I enjoy; some times beef can be good but it can be pretty bad too - lamb +/-  I don't mind smoked mackreal and eat a lot of eggs (10 a day) although super fussy with those since they can taste fishy dependant on feed. Obviously you can't really make a stew on carnivore. Thing is when you are mostly eating say ground beef every single batch has a different taste and texture since carnivore doesn't hide meat in various flavours so when a miince is good it's good and when it's bad...Oh I do use diary and smoothering everything in butter helps,
le6ng22,t1_ldxj9sj,1e6lrew,TBH I hate the smell of beef too; dairy stinks. Normie food smells terrible too with all the farty onions and other shite; almost no food smells good to me,

Meat stock made with meat like oxtails or knee bones, or even just a  gelatinous chicken stock- chicken feet, salt and some root veggies (optional) cooked for two hours would probably really help. Use 1 lb of meat (a collagenous cut, preferably a joint attached to a bone) to 2 quarts water. Bring to a boil, then simmer for about an hour.

As a formerly unwell person myself, I understand you might face a low appetite/ low energy levels to prepare fancy schmancy meals for yourself.

That means, minimizing liquid intake and maximizing animal proteins (I go for frozen Aussie minced beef, and supplement with room temperature Ghee, which is more digestible for me as it has milk solids from butter removed.)",

Both the steak and the Barbacoa have this ""adobo base"" made with rice bran oil. The steak is not supposed to be cooked with oil (though sometimes they just do + there's whatever left over from the chicken).

lr91wtj,t3_1g0faqz,1g0faqz,Same! I'm only eight weeks in but cannot get over the positive changes. The constant GI discomfort is gone. I've lost 12lbs. I'm seldom hungry and shocked at how much more quickly I feel full than when I was shoveling in the carbs. My nervous system feels much different. I had a severe bout of gout about a dozen years ago and the joint below my right big toe has ached and felt infected in some way ever since. It feels normal today.

kr488fa,t3_1au6z0r,1au6z0r,"Hi,

New to carnivore (\~approx 6 months).

I try not to evangelize on this anymore because of what you and I and all the others know about the response. In any case, It's a huge positive life change for me.  None of the other methods I tried worked:  vegetarian, lo-carb, meat avoidance, meditation, anti-depressants, etc... Since carnivore, I dumped the meds and dumped the happy pills and I sleep better, think more clearly, no joint aches and no more anxiety.  Weight loss is not my primary goal as much as I wanted to avoid diabetes after a shitty pre-diabetes diagnosis last summer.  However, I have lost weight but there is more to go before I get to my personal ideal weight.  But the anxiety and joint pain leaving is HUGE. 

So...I think non-carnis are averse to it because 1.) ignorance of the results and the science behind it 2.) societal conditioning of the 'balanced diet' 3.) the idea of eating only ONE THING is strange and downright repugnant if the one thing is MEAT.

The worm has turned though, because carnis exist, the good doctors and researchers exist and current, relevant science exists that proves carnivore has positive effect on human beings.  I look forward to more science that shows the benefit of the carnivore lifestyle.",

kr4s37k,t3_1au6z0r,1au6z0r,"Besides the effects of marketing and all the dietary advice they may have heard influencing people, I think of it on a cultural and civilization level. The invention of agriculture is what enabled civilization to develop (by providing quantity of food even at the expense of quality of life) and has been an integral part of human history for 12,000 years. That's 12,000 years of almost every culture in the world making plants a diet staple. It's ingrained in every facet life, from socializing to how we structure our day to how we celebrate. 

It's been interesting to me exploring this diet as a history nut because every time I think about it, it's so *logical*. I haven't been hungry like at all the last few weeks and I went searching for posts here, and someone was saying ""Do you think hunter-gatherers were eating 3 meals a day plus snacks? No. They had to be able to wait between hunts."" There are immense drawbacks to civilization and one of them is becoming divorced from our true nature. No one on a SAD would question how little sense it would make for our ancestors to need to eat constantly, and a lot of those food sources (at the time) were barely edible or poisonous. Despite making zero sense, nobody questions it at all. Partly because the majority of people are doing it, and people naturally mimic what they perceive to be success/survival. (As an aside I think some people have the genetics to do better on a SAD than the general population, which is what leads to so many people to get in a horrible loop of following different diets and the next new fad supplement, etc.)

In modern society we are so removed from our own instincts for a lot of different reasons but mostly because it's the compromise that glues civilization together. People aren't just weird about eating a carnivore diet, pretty much every facet of their life is warping them out of their natural state and food is one of them. It's very hard for people to change this conditioning and following your example, it's normal in society for people to have chronic illnesses so they don't think twice about it. It's unfortunate but a lot of people just aren't openminded and seem to have a higher tolerance for suffering, in that they aren't as motivated as others to try to resolve it through methods outside the norm and can accept/ignore a level of chronic pain or discomfort.",

kr4mfkc,t3_1au6z0r,1au6z0r,"A lot of people do actually want to stay ill. They've been ill for so long that it's become a major part of their personality, and they've built most of their social life/community around it. Losing that would mean losing themselves. I know I was absolutely terrified when I was faced with the reality of losing my vegetarian identity; looking back now, I find it ridiculous and I'm glad I let go of unnecessary labels, but until then, it was all I had known, and I was worried I wouldn't know who I was without it. It takes a lot of strength to shift your perspective as an ill adult. Staying in a shitty situation almost seems safer in a weird way.

A lot of people with life-long illnesses have also tried dozens of different diets already, all of which promised to resolve their issues but then never delivered. We know why they failed, but they don't, so they see it as just another diet of deprivation. When you're in constant discomfort from your illness, the last thing you want is to give up even more things, and the carnivore diet definitely requires you give up everything. I'm personally one to try something right away if it sounds as promising and logical as carnivore does, but even I find it incredibly difficult, especially on days when I have pain, nausea, and fatigue from my illnesses.

Meat has also been associated with gluttony from years of brainwashing, and I think people find it repulsive to indulge that much. I know I was shocked to learn how much of it I was supposed to eat. We've also become so far removed from the natural order and have consequently softened up, so most people find killing animals highly immoral, preventing them from even considering it. Then there's the dogma that science has absolutely proven that meat is cancerous and obesogenic. We also have a society where food addiction is the norm rather than the exception, most social settings as well as strong positive and negative life events revolve around it, and everything must taste phenomenal at all times, so it's hard to escape. Pretty much everything that goes against the norm is met with insane resistance when you think about it - even simple diets like gluten-free or lactose-free will be met with dismissal and contempt from people who don't understand it, it's almost expected for carnivore to be so hated.",

""Meat causes heart attacks"" ""too much fat causes cholesterol to become high/unhealthy"". ""Low fat helps you lose fat"" ""the fat you eat is the fat you wear"", ""Cico is how you lose weight/body fat"".

I used to be vegan so the idea of eating the reverse is very scary. Like am I going to die eating so much meat and fat, clogging my arteries and increasing my chances for heart attack or strokes? I fell for that for 5 years and now I'm more meat based, but suffering from intestinal issues from so much fiber when I was vegan/raw til 4.

Yet Big AG/Pharma and the food pyramid has been around for years saying to eat more grains, fiber, fruit and veg, etc yet eat so much less animal products. 

Plus it doesn't help that food scientists are making food hyper palatable to make you crave more and more, staying fat, sick and unhealthy.",
kr40bw8,t3_1au6z0r,1au6z0r,"The response I get most often after I'm asked about my diet as I start explaining it is ""I couldn't live without eating fruits"". 

I usually just respond that ""I never told you to do my diet. It's your life"", then just continue with the benefits that I experience.  

People have their ""truths"" rooted into them deeply with a lots of subjects. It's not easy for anyone to accept that they have been lied to all their lives. If you try to convince anyone that they are wrong about one of their ""truths"", it's more than likely that they will become defensive and try to prove you wrong.  
If you want to help them, the best you can do is make them curious, show them your success until they start to ask you for advice. Never try to argue with someone or act superior, because it will have the opposite effect.  

It's not an easy task to make someone believe that for example fruits are bad, when all their lives they have been told by everyone that it's healthy. People are often too lazy to think for themselves, and just prefer to accept the narrative instead.  

*Tinfoil hat on*  
By narrative what I mean, is not only the interests of big pharma. Consuming carbs is also in political interest.  
I believe that since it's harder and harder for countries to sustain the Ponzi scheme that they built (see website: wtfhappenedin1971), since animal based foods are much more expensive to produce, if everyone would switch to that, the majority of the people would starve. From history we know what usually happens to leaders when people are starving.  
So they are basically forced to fund everything that shows this to be unhealthy/dangerous and keep the carb based narrative alive as best as they can.",

a certain part of their brain imo has been primed to respond in a certain way to certain ... topics shall we say

to take a popular response I used to get when talking about various other topics

'why would they lie' 'what would they have to gain'

and when you can't answer the above in a way that satisfies them, you are, by their brain, classified as a certain 'type' of person

therefore, anything you say or do is the doings of a deranged, out of touch, loonie .. dare i say  the C word , , , CONSPIRACY NUT

carnivore touches upon widely held societal beliefs that by challenging, you are challenging a persons understanding of reality, and by proxy their intellect

so, to summarise, i think it get's a lot of hate because people feel attacked/insulted

as a rule of thumb in my humble experience, and not to be edgy or hipster, if something is generally hated by the for lack of a better word 'sheep', then it's probably a good thing and those people have been made to hate it without truly knowing how or why

obviously use discernment when applying the above and understand it isn't all encompassing .. for example, veganism is also treated much the same way, or even worse, as the butt of jokes in pop culture..

loo9cgq,t1_lonpp6v,1fnfhwp,"I’m primarily OMAD, but don’t hesitate to have a second meal if I’m particularly hungry (that happens maybe once a fortnight). That wasn’t really a conscious decision – it just happened naturally. 

I’m a night owl and don’t wake until 11am, so I eat at my natural dinner time, which is around 8pm (6-7 hours before bedtime). 

I’ve never been a breakfast eater, but now I rarely get hungry throughout the day. If I am, I might cook up a 250g sirloin or porterhouse, or 2 x 125g smash patties. Luckily, I work from home, so there’s no risk of getting caught out by not preparing a lunch in advance. 

Every second night, I cook a 800g-1kg eye fillet roast or scotch fillet roast. I usually can’t quite finish it and leave a small amount (~200g) to eat cold with dinner the next night, or as lunch on those days I feel like it.

Alternating nights are usually a 500g rump steak or 2 x scotch fillet steaks (~400g). 

I’ve discovered I prefer leaner cuts with added fats, so I cook everything in beef dripping. I also just started buying beef fat from the butcher and making beef crackling in the air fryer, so I might do a few small pieces to go with my dinner if I’m craving it. 

The biggest difference for me is that I’ve become a lot more intuitive when it comes to eating and I feel confident that I can receive and respond to my body’s signals. 

I was originally hung up about not eating 1kg+ of meat a day and worried that I wasn’t getting enough fat. But it didn’t take long for me to start paying attention to my cravings and putting trust in the idea that my body will tell me what it needs. 

I also naturally fast once, sometimes twice, a fortnight. Unlike when I lost the weight on keto, I don’t consciously do it – if I’m not hungry, I don’t force myself to eat. I find that it leaves my appetite unchanged the following day.

Sorry about the wall of text, but hopefully there’s something in there that’s helpful to you. 😁",😁

I found the change from a SAD diet to carnivore too drastic so have been easing in. I'm about 80% carnivore and eating some nuts. Hoping to go full carnivore on October 1st.

loogtm2,t1_loo9cgq,1fnfhwp,"all sounds great, the way it's working for you. 

one thing I'd suggest, is have a feast day every so often. What that does is rev up the metabolism. 

It's good to do anytime, but if you do it the day before your fast, you'll have provided your body what it needs to build muscle and bone density signalling you are not in a state of scarcity, revved up your metabolism, and your body can draw down on your fat tissue for energy that fast day.",

Even if you’re not doing it “perfectly”, you’re miles ahead compared to eating the SAD. 

I came from 18 months on strict keto and I still had an adjustment period. 

And I honestly wouldn’t stress too much about trying to add exercise right away. I only added it as my energy levels rose enough that I wanted to exercise. 

I’m still not particularly active compared to a lot of people. I do a daily walk with my dog, do 60 mins of yoga a week, and maybe go for a hike on the weekend. It’s only recently that I’ve found myself considering joining my local CrossFit club – and that’s because I’m feeling strong and have excess energy. 

I don’t pretend to be any kind of expert, but I think a lot of people come to this diet undernourished and sick. I personally entered with the priority of healing – the rest is just kind of taking care of itself.

The way I see it is that I spent years failing my body before it finally started failing me. But it’s taken less time to heal than it did to reach that point of feeling broken.

Asking it to take on strenuous exercise would have been a bridge too far when I first started, but it hasn’t taken long to reach the point where my body is actually craving activity. 

I hope you stick with it and be kind to yourself. ❤️",❤

I also didn't work out at all for the first month, but still felt amazing and lost weight, if it's causing you issues you may want to hold back on that until you're fully 100% onboard.

But right now I’m prioritising listening to my body’s signals, so I’m not comfortable with the idea of forcing myself to eat. 

I don’t actually decide to fast – it just happens spontaneously, so it’s not really possible to prep for it. I can’t predict the days I don’t want to eat, or the days where I want a second meal. 

I definitely agree with the principle of stocking up before a scheduled fast, but that’s something I’m avoiding after going to extremes to achieve the 50kg weight loss.",

 Like you said cutting out all the processed rubbish is the first step. The more I listen to and read about Carnivore, the more it makes sense.

loolfou,t1_loojd1c,1fnfhwp,"still worth doing it. here's why. we settle into a routine, a quantity. our body adjusts our metabolism to match. there are no hunger signals for more. 

but eating a feast meal? it's a fantastic feeling the next day, buoyant energy. and tbqh, the night of? higher libido, lol.

It was traditional to have feast days -- celebrations, animal harvests, etc. 

This way of eating isn't about restricting quantities to lose fat, it's about healthy recomp based on hormonal response to the types and quantity of foods being eaten. If you look at the old school body builders -- their leaning out phase for getting competition lean was 8,900 cals per day of protein and fat.  

Highly recommend including feast day as part of your rotation :)",

I could think of no rebuttal so I awkwardly smiled and said, (pointing to my pointy, pink gums) ""that my gum health has never been better since starting Carnivore"".

I did not comment about her swollen, blotchy face, that she was the same age as me but looked ten years older (like me 6 months ago before going Carnivore), or her lack of curiosity that is endemic of our whole healthcare system, etc.  I just ate my eggs and bacon.

Very rarely curiosity. Even more rare is any thought given to diet and its resulting effect on our bodies metabolic health!  Like literally CRICKETS!

I have had more hostile responses than positive, that's for sure... and that is not through me preaching.  It is when I am discovered!

Was this really suggested to you by your doctor? Maybe we're from different places, but it really isn't common to have doctors where I'm from (Australia) recommending carnivore diets. Like, a big part of being carnivore is knowing the science behind why the health industry is very messed up. Very few doctors know much about nutrition, and there are even fewer doctors who recommend carnivore.

It's for this reason I think that in the many interactions I've had where I've suggested my eating habits are based in an understanding of health and science that has been recommended by doctors, I am often met with skepticism. I can't say I've found it helpful. It can even emphasise awkward tensions because some might take it to imply you are judging their way of eating.

Also not sure if you mean that you say this as a white lie to smooth things over? Because that was sort of what I meant in my OP when I talked about having repeated interactions with people, since that stuff tends to come back up after meeting people more than once. I know it's not a massive thing to be dishonest about, but it does tend to make things harder because often people will go on to ask more questions and before you know it, you're embroiled in a fiction.

lhwmuow,t1_lhw7ffk,1eqwb61,"Mad respect to you for taking back your life and healing from autoimmune disorder <3 so awesome.

For me carnivore did heal a lot of things in my life, but nothing so dramatic. Since severe autoimmune stuff has run in my family, and I have had minor problems related to autoimmune issues (mostly psoriasis), I have mentioned all that as a reason I avoid food that's being offered to me, especially after hearing a lot of carnivores on facebook suggesting that saying stuff like this worked to ease awkwardness in social situations.

In my experience this didn't work. Even when you put in as much effort to qualify everything as I did (i.e., 'it wasn't me with the autoimmune disorder, it was my family'), more often than not people tend to treat it as way more serious than it is, often because they really don't understand the terminology you're using and assume it must be dire. These reactions made me feel icky, like i was leeching off the empathy of people who genuinely suffered much worse than I did. And me feeling icky didn't help the whole social interaction thing.

Not to mention, any empathy this inspires isn't always a good thing. It often isn't even empathy, but it's sympathy. It can be a downward looking 'poor you, that must be awful to have had health problems'. It can turn into people treating you with kid gloves because they are terrified of making you sick by feeding you the wrong thing. Or they may see it as a sort of charity to put in any extra effort to finding venues that can feed you.

Things like posture play a big role, genetics, diseases, facial features running in family, etc…long before starting this diet i used to watch documentaries or youtube videos about people who only eat specific things, a few of them being only meat eaters. I remember one vividley who definitley didnt look outstandingley healthy and symmetrical in any way.
I feel like its important to be realistic about what a WOE can do for you and what not. Tons of Models that are considered sexsymbols and are super symmetrical live on plants and cigarettes. Think Models like Adrianna Lima (mentioning her for looks, i dunno the way she eats) - its genes.",

kxe0inz,t1_kxbtz9q,1brw8gf,"I dont disagree that genes play a big role on appearance, but people definetly reach their highest potential on nutrional dense food, aka animal food.

I've watched documentaries where they studied why people in tribes with same gene, even twin brothers had different appearance and one had crooked rotting teeth while the other has perfect straight teeth, turned out the ones with perfect teeth and jaw didn't eat things that are processed or refined but the moment they got introduced to modern food products they began to develop cavities and allergies, and the allergies lead to malformation in face since it forces people to breath through their mouth thus creating recessed chin and undeveloped jaw with lack of high quality protein.

It is undeniable that lack of protein with complete amino acids and fatty acids will result in your body not being the most developed it can, altough people can be beautiful without being on a meat based diet, it doesn't deny that eating meat gives your body all the necessary nutrients for a healthy, beautiful appearance.

The countries with the tallest people have a a funny coincidence of drinking alot of milk, Dutch and Montenegro for example",
kxifcso,t1_kxbtz9q,1brw8gf,"Yes I'm sure that genetics has an influence. However, it shouldn't be controversial that diet has a major impact on facial dimensions and health qualities such as dental health. Back in the 1930s, Weston A. Price traveled to a lot of regions and analyzed health factors for various populations. Uniformly, those people eating traditional whole foods including animal foods had better dental health, were taller, etc. It was typical to see broader faces and larger/straighter teeth in those eating traditionally. Those whose diets had been infiltrated by the industrial foods industry (refined flours and sugars, etc.) had poorer health qualities including tooth cavities, smaller/crooked teeth, etc. Of the populations eating traditional foods, those eating more animal foods had better health factors (better teeth, were taller and broader, etc.).

It's covered with extreme thoroughness in the book Nutrition and Physical Degeneration.

There have since then been other research efforts which had the same findings.",

She told me those cauliflower wings tasted JUST like chicken, they did not!  I don't mind cauliflower but that has to be the worst way to eat it.

I punched in carnivore recipes on TikTok last night while my burgers were cooking and first thing was a pizza. Crust was made of chicken, cheese and egg.  In the time it took to flip burgers I found half a dozen things I wanna make and a few my kids will prob enjoy.  Chicken nuggets is chicken dipped in egg and then crushed pork rhinds.  I'm not sure about pork rhinds, I think I might swap that for some fresh grated cheese like Parm or pecorino/Romano?  I don't know. 

Maybe next date cook at home, the setting will be more intimate and the food will be less expensive and might taste better if you can pull it off.

We don't have the resources to do what you are saying, to run a sprawling dicusdion board which reviews studies. We keep things focused on how to do carnivore. 

For studies, I will say that what we need are over-feeding studies. Well-designed 5,000 - 6,000 calories a day, different compositions, 

(if there was a carnivore arm, they would have to learn how to do it first -- there's no way someone could eat 6,000 out of the gate 😂

but a *very* low carb arm, ketogenic, relatively small proportion  of green vegetables, fatty meat, supplemental animal fat , compared to a standard diet or a ""harvard mediterranean"" that would be fascinating",😂

m1nzxwn,t1_m1k58ez,1h5lkm6,"No, I don't. CICO is the very definition of a tautology. A single equation with so few controlled variables but so many slack variables that you can apply everywhere and still ""prove"" it. Its scientific value is exactly zero for that very reason. It cannot provide any meaningful prediction, and it cannot be used to design any class of weight control diet or routine. As such, trying to ""prove"" or ""disprove"" it with any kind of studies is fruitless. Therefore, ""calories don't matter"", and the fact that these studies have to control and adjust so many slack/uncontrolled variables reinforces that statement.

The MIMO (Mass in, Mass out) model, however, paints a different picture. It has a few more equations, less uncontrollable variables, and it can provide measurable predictions, which have yet to be disproven. That is a valid scientific theory with meaningful applications.",

kylmixk,t1_kyl0z7k,1by5l7j,"Sure. My breakfast usually consists of a selection of salo 

1) cured pork fat - I made a post about it earlier. It’s delicious, there are different kinds so it’s hard to get bored and it’s perfect for carnivore. It also does wonders for controlling hunger. If I hungry throughout the day and have no time to eat a couple of slices of cheese and salo completely takes care of it. The only 2 ingredients are pork fat and salt. 

2) jamon - I have started buying whole legs at Costco after a recent trip to Spain. It’s delicious lasts forever since it has to be sliced thin and has zero ingredients other than pork and salt. 

3) a selection of other meats for variety (think salami, other interesting deli cuts I find at stores, etc). 

4) cheeses - I love them all and I buy most of them at Aldi which has a decent selection and i can get a bit of everything. 

I am not a huge fan of the typical American breakfast of eggs and bacon. I do eat both but prefer the above. 

The rest of the day I snack on jamon, cheese, etc. 

I eat ball kinds of proteins and fats not just beef. I really like pork belly in an air fryer, pork knuckles in a pressure cooker are better than candy if you cook them for a couple of hours and then throw into an air fryers to crisp up on the outside. I like seafood. Shrimp is my go to when I want something delicious and quick. I fry them up in chilly oil and salt and pepper. I like salmon, but I eat it raw. Cut it up for sashimi with a bit of soy sauce and a bit of wasabi (I know that’s not exactly strict carnivore but I don’t use a lot of it and it works for me). 

For a quick meal I make fish cakes out of canned salmon (mix with a little eggs, crushed chicharrones and salt/pepper). They’re better than restaurant fish cakes. 

I just tried making cakes out of canned beef :) and they came out DELICIOUS. Again I don’t really eat canned foods often but they are really convenient sometimes when you need something very quick. Also look at ingredients. If you’re using canned salmon use the one that has salmon, salt and that’s it. Same with beef. It’s basically pressure cooked beef in its own juices and fat. Nothing else. 

Sometimes I just want a sandwich and I make “waffles) and freeze a bunch of them in advance. Full fat mozzarella (1lb), 4 eggs, chicharrones and some slices like salt, pepper, sometimes with a pinch of basil. That’s all. In a small waffle maker. They hold their shape, can be toasted later on and make perfect bread substitute. 

Hope that helps!",

Also things like canned beef have just 3 ingredients, beef, fat and salt. I am careful to only stock those. 

Jamon is technically processed meat but the only ingredients are pork, salt and lots of time. Same goes for salo. That’s just fat and salt. 

Technically the only highly processed meat I eat is salami but we’re talking about 2-3 pieces at breakfast :)

I haven’t included any complex recipes but I cook a lot and I make things like my own deli meats. I know my way around nitrite salts and I am not afraid of weird ingredients. Just made a huge pork sausage that I make a lot out of pork skin and ground pork.

loaa1kv,t3_1fkqquy,1fkqquy,"Coming from someone who eats an animal based diet with plenty of carbs from fruit, diary, honey and maple syrup added to a low pufa gf beef and pastured eggs diet on a daily basis, I am happy that this sub exists for those who don’t eat any carbs so they can have a place to share content and ideas. 

The fact that people cannot understand that this is the place for pure zero carb carnivores is beyond me. But I guess people don’t understand a lot of things. 

Animal based is always there for those who want to add carbs or just experiment with it. I’d love to see research that delineates the difference between long term metabolic health on very low to no omega-6 pufa animal based diet vs a medium-normal O-6 pufa AB vs high O-6 pufa AB.

It can get tricky with this sub, bc the label carnivore is actually not all that specific, and can be indicative of both low omega-6 pufa carnivores like grass fed lion dieters and the carnivores who eat conventional bacon/pork and eggs/poultry and that could be extremely high in omega-6 pufa causing a long term state of insulin resistance, basically forcing them to stay within the confines of that diet. 

I hypothesize that the grass fed lion dieters who exist within this sub, are the most metabolically healthy among the population, along with those who include some pastured eggs, and could add in low pdc carbs (fruit, honey, maple) without any issues but to study that would take decades and a lot of funding. 

So i think there almost should be two zerocarb subs, the affordable one (inclusive of any animal food) where if you eat carbs you basically become diabetic and an even stricter one where you have to be pretty wealthy and neurotic to maintain where only grass fed and pastured ruminants with some eggs are allowed. 

That way the latter could show that adding carbs didn’t actually wreck their metabolism and the the problem is not apples and fructose but rather the fact that most commercially farmed animals are fed seeds and are packing seed oils in their adipose tissue.",

lnxvmsn,t1_lnxq2wx,1fkqquy,"keep in mind, fruit was only ever seasonal.

think of it a short addition to the diet fatten for the winter.

sugar, including from fruit :) has fructose in it and fructose can have negative effects on the liver, including the development of fatty liver..  (and removing it from the diet improves liver health)

there is also the way fructose is involved in fattening -- so fatty meat + fruit, the  fruit sends the signal to store the fat. completely different than the zerocarb carnivore diet. (look up Dr. Richard Johnson's work on fructose and uric acid)

For anyone who has prediabetes or T2D, fruit worsens the condition.

notice, even for gaining, when that is the goal, Vince Gironda was sparing in the addition of fruit -- it also has aging effects.  Starches, vegetables, meat were the preferred foods.

the tight moderation -- knowing it only applies to a small group with little flexibility -- came about because the longterm carnivores found that there was a difference even between what they had already been doing -- low carb, even a very low carb eaten at a ketogenic ratio with intermittent fasting (and incl longer term fasts!) -- and getting rid of all plant foods, taking the carbs to zero.

and the space was for talking about that, living like that, wondering why it makes a difference and starting to gather and discuss info about it. a small corner of the internet that is not filled with discussion, pics and recipes about mixed diets. from experience,

whenever the moderation is lightened up, it gets overrun with ""wannabe carnivores"" who feel that because they eat a lot of meat, their diet fits with this sub. those can be healthy diets as well, but they aren't what this sub is about!

l7t0iog,t1_l7spzic,1db3aii,Lucky you!,
l7t6k7l,t1_l7spxlp,1db3aii,Got it. Maybe your cuts are generally too lean? The suggestion is to eat at least 1:1 in fat to protein grams and then work up from there. That fattiness is the level of ribeye and chuck roast and all the cuts you listed except bacon are less fatty than that. But if adding the duck fat works then it’s not too bad,
l7y21oo,t1_l7spulf,1db3aii,"I like the way Dr Ken Berry explains this. In our evolutionary past, if we under-ate, it was a signal to the body to hold onto fat reserves because you might have fallen down a ravine and broken your leg and you're stuck there starving, or there was food scarcity and nobody in the tribe was catching any food to eat. Holding onto fat was the body's survival mechanism for getting you through those lean times.

If you eat fatty meat to satiety, your body gets the signal ""We are definitely NOT starving, everything is good, look at all this fat! Ok, it is safe to let go of some of our excess fat reserves.""

It makes a lot of sense from an evolutionary perspective.

Nowadays, people who have chronically dieted have always tried to lose weight by going into a calorie deficit, but all that does is stress the body out because it thinks you are starving, so the body holds into its fat reserves. Even when you lose weight using that method, it's just setting a ticking time bomb for when you will eventually snap and go on a binge because your mammalian body thinks you have been starving. There's no fighting your own biology at that point and you just gorge yourself, that's how binge-purging works.

Eating fat to LOSE fat definitely is counter-intuitive, because we've had CICO hammered into us from day 1.",
l7thpeb,t1_l7spulf,1db3aii,My baseless speculation is that eating more fat causes your body to interpret it as a time of plenty and so it no longer needs to hold so much fat on it.,

No rest days per se - just not going all out due to previous injuries

Good luck to you both!

I haven't been tempted to break the no sugar/no carbs rules but there was a single meal where I felt there was no choice and ate a burger with buns and chips. It didn't set me back, I just drew a line under it and carried on.

l7sg42l,t1_l7qzbpx,1db3aii,"I eat either steak or ground beef around noon, sometimes a bit later. If it's steak it's about 1 to 1.1 lbs if it's ground beef it's about 0.8 lbs (if my math checks out). And in the evening I'll eat about 0.5/0.6 lbs of ground beef or about 0.6/0.7 lbs steak.

The ground beef I have is pretty fatty and I can't really seem to handle large amounts of fat. So maybe I need some more time adapting to it. 

To be fair, in the beginning I was drinking apple juice for the first 4 weeks so I was not even in ketosis. Then I switched to sugar free 'soda', not like diet coke or anything but syrup with water. And now for about 2+ weeks water only (and beef). I'm really thirsty constantly, so that's annoying and weird to me. Because I'm drinking quite a lot of water.

The lectins have always been present, and yes, a few people make them the staple of their diet now that foods are abundant. This still doesn't explain the explosion in these diseases. 

If you want to believe lectins are the cause of everything, go ahead, maybe they are, but without the glyphosate,oxidized fryer oil, excessive antibiotic use, and so on, the gut lining wouldn't have been on its last leg to be KO'd by lectins in the majority of cases.

I literally agree with you on excessive oxlates and so on. I tell people to never eat spinach for that reason. But it's kind of ignorant to demonize natural pesticides in plants more so than a human-made toxin sprayed on plants. Outside someone only eating uncooked beans, spinach, or some other very unlikely equivalent the human made chemicals are going to be more disastrous. 

They are both bad, just don't dismiss pesticides as if they're nothing, thanks.

m86io37,t3_1i2ztwo,1i2ztwo,all y’all complaining about people talking about tiny amounts of non meat food are honestly more annoying than the people doing it. basically all carnivorous animals eat plants occasionally for a variety of reasons. intolerance of slight differences in choices is kind of lame when everyone here is eating wildly differently from the cultural norm and all might need support,
m7ykxc3,t3_1i2ztwo,1i2ztwo,">There’s nobody in vegan subs asking other vegans permission to eat ribeyes, eggs, and ground beef.

Well, that's because their way of eating is rooted in an ideology, so all animal products are categorically off-limits.

Meanwhile, the carnivore way of eating is primarily focused on health benefits. Therefore, when people ask if they can include certain non-animal products, they probably want to know whether those foods might impact their health to the same extent as other non-animal products.",
m7zacpj,t3_1i2ztwo,1i2ztwo,"The rigid adherence to dogma is entertaining at least. The entire thesis behind carnivore is that plants contain toxins to protect themselves which cause negative adverse health effects and inflammation in humans. Thats why when people go carnivore they have overwhelming health improvements to energy, mental health, well being, the works. However, people asking questions about additional things to add to that lifestyle isnt wrong as humans tend to be pretty biodiverse and not ""everything"" is going to cause an adverse negative health outcome. Like mushrooms, not in the plant kingdom, closer to animals, and do not seem to carry the negative adverse outcomes that plants do.

The way someone eats is a personal thing for them. While we can share our own stories, beliefs and what works or does not work for us, a person's diet is an individual thing. Not everything will fall under a specific label, and it is not our place to apply such things. It is not our place to tell anyone how they should or should not eat, or define the food rules of carnivore.

""Muscle power—your ability to generate force quickly—is one of the strongest predictors of longevity, even more so than being lean. This is sometimes referred to as the 'fat but powerful' paradox.

""In a recent study, older adults with normal and high levels of relative muscle power had better 9-year survival than older adults with low muscle power.

""Muscle power was even protective against death in older adults with high levels of body fatness measured using BMI and waist circumference.

""Being fat and powerful reduced mortality just as much as being lean and powerful—by 43–45%.

""Being lean and weak, however, provided no survival advantage compared to being fat and weak.""",

it's a chart showing what happens to zinc absorption when the animal food is eaten on its own, compared to when it is eaten with corn or with beans. 

the high, random-ish levels of minerals in supplements can mess with absorption of the ones in meat. google any combination of minerals and you'll see their complex interactions, including some decreasing the  absorption of others. 

For this diet, you're eating the ideal sourres of nutrients without the foods which block their absorption, you need to let them be, not mess things up by taking a supplement. 

there is a section about why not to track calories -- you'll need more initially than you do later on. the 2lbs is a goal to aim for you may need more. i'll get the link later

this is all volunteer here, nothing to sell, and the sdvice is not to take supplements unless you have a known deficiency and it is prescribed. 

stop it when the deficiency is resolved bc supplements interfere with absorption of other nutrients and will throw things off

ktjo9q2,t3_1b7hwgw,1b7hwgw,"I'm glad it worked out for you!

I'm in the same boat, but mostly for dysphagia with my GERD, 40mg of Pantoprazole once a day.  Meat gets stuck in my throat on the way down much more often than other foods, which makes it hard for me to eat enough on carnivore, and often is so bad I have to skip the meal and try again later.  Pantoprazole is the only thing that seems to prevent it from happening, but it still happens occasionally with steak and salmon even when taking it.  I've also had an upper GI and they cleared me with a shrug.  :\

What did you eat for those 2 months and did you ween yourself off or just drop it cold turkey?  Update us in a month or so if you remain cured.  I've tried to drop it many times and it always comes back in a few weeks.  Would love to try what you did and be rid of it forever.",

ktrc3tt,t3_1b7hwgw,1b7hwgw,Since I started keto (later carnivore) I don't have reflux. All of my family member have so I assumed it's a family curse but it turned out I was wrong. I always had to eat at least a medium size meal before coffee (a small amount didn't do the trick) and now I drink black coffee at 10am before my first meal at 2.30pm. If I did such a thing years ago my stomach would be like a vulcano. I'm glad a lot of us experience the same.,

Zero carbs though or as close to it as possible. 

I’ve traveled a bit during those 2 months, some time in Florida and a couple of weeks in Spain. Spain was actually easy since they love their Jamons, salamis and cured meats as well as all kinds of pork :)

I’ll try to follow up in a month or two or feel free to reach out and I’ll update you on the progress.

eg, When someone with T2D or T1D is taking insulin they need to decrease the dose right away when starting low carb or carnivore. (People with T2D often need to discontinue it right away. People with T1D will decrease their basal dose, according to their glucose monitor readings: The decrease for people with T1D is about 1/3 to 1/2 of typical basal dosing and dosing for meals as usual, based on type and quatity. For anyone coming across this wanting to know more, here is  info about low carb or carnivore and T1D, resources, groups to connect with, [https://www.reddit.com/r/zerocarb/comments/s2ovk7/comment/hsfyiku/?utm\_source=share&utm\_medium=web2x&context=3](https://www.reddit.com/r/zerocarb/comments/s2ovk7/comment/hsfyiku/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3)) 

BP meds are not like insulin, they are titrated down on a slower schedule. 

When people switch to low carb, it is weeks or more typically months before beginning to titrate BP medications",
ltmb0dq,t3_1garcab,1garcab,"I completely lost track of most of the benefits that I've experienced, a few months into the diet. I've never been entirely comfortable with talking about them to other people, because some of the health improvements sound like miracles or something, and I figured most people will probably just assume that I'm lying when I mention the ones that sound the most ""out there"" 😅

I've had very few health issues in my life. The biggest, most frustrating issue I've had is persistent, dry eye symptoms. The carnivore diet made me realize that I wasn't sleeping very well prior to it, it made my allergies go away entirely after about 2-3 months, my memory and general cognition improved so much that I was struggling to believe it at one point, and a million trivial issues that I've always taken for granted either vanished or were drastically reduced.

That said, while the diet made me realize that I've likely had a lot of trivial health issues for many years and considered it normal/unproblematic, it took me over a year to realize how complacent I had become from not having those issues anymore. Sometimes, you don't know what you have until it returns.

I'd been on the diet for almost 1.5 years when I went on vacation this summer and decided to eat whatever I was served for 2 weeks. Didn't seem like a big deal, it was only a short vacation. I didn't notice much of a difference during that time, other than irregular bowel movement and bordering constipation. It wasn't until a couple of weeks later that all of the issues started returning.

Allergy was back, dry eye symptoms was back, sleep went from an average of 8-9 hours to 4-5 and I started snoring according to my sleep app. I thought that was bad enough, but then I noticed that I was struggling to recall memories and organize my thoughts while at work, and occasionally I experienced difficulties with stringing sentences together while talking to people. It's issues/improvements like this that I've always been hesitant to talk about with others, because they sound silly and sometimes made up. Most people can't seem to even imagine that a change of diet can have much of an impact beyond very shallow health benefits.",😅

ltnobc4,t3_1garcab,1garcab,"When I stick to carnivore I experience far less pain. 

I work as a sketch artist at parties and events, often drawing non-stop for three to five hours at a stretch. This way of eating prevents my back muscles on the right side from cramping and seizing up, a serious issue that started when I went back to work after the pandemic. If I go off of carnivore, the muscle spasms return. It also dramatically reduces the arthritis pain I’ve had for over twenty years, especially in my knees.

As for cognition, I’m 63 and definitely feel happier and much more mentally sharp than when I was still eating carb-heavy foods, probably due to steady blood glucose and a diet high in amino acids. 

 Doing a month-long priming period of eating only beef, eggs, pork belly and butter worked better for permanently eliminating carb and processed food cravings than anything else I’ve ever tried.",

lu7z9hz,t1_lu6qx7j,1garcab,"Yay, Thank you for chiming in! I've noticed the same thing with techniques. Although I don't now, I used to sing in metal bands. All of my metal vocals are suddenly gone. It's fine because it's not something that I do very often, but I do hope to redevelope that part of my voice at some point in time. Just in case you were unaware, metal vocals are generally pretty quiet irl, and not nearly as brutal on the vocal cords as they sound. I have noticed the improvement in smell as well. It unfortunately makes me a bit more picky with my meat as when it just barely starts to get funky, I can still smell that funk after cooking and I just cannot get it down. It kind of reminds me of when I quit smoking 15 years ago.",
ltmlxzl,t1_ltmerjm,1garcab,"It's funny you should mention that, because I recall watching an interview on Youtube with a successful business owner who talked about feeling dumb for over 20 years of his life before discovering the carnivore diet.

I'm not going to pretend to know what the explanation behind that phenomenon could be, but I am curious if carnitine plays a part in it. I've been reading about carnitine lately, mostly related to it's effects on people with autism, but also it's general purpose in the body. It's a nutrient that I find really fascinating.

It's considered a non-essential amino acid because the body produces it naturally (all bodies with red meat do). However, people who have some degree of autism apparently produce a lower amount of it, and it's possible that there are other conditions that reduce the natural production of it as well. Some people would argue that it should be considered essential, but that's complicated by the fact that it's exclusively found in red meat, which we're typically told not to consume much of.

Carnitine is mostly associated with the process of converting fat to energy, but it's also involved in the connection of synpses in the brain and the processing of new information. It has garnered more attention recently, since they did an experiment in Australia (last year, I believe) where they put groups of people with autism on a red meat diet for a couple of months. The result was that everyone in the group experienced a lessening of symptoms, and supposedly, the group that consisted of kids below the age of 6 had some participants who got rid of their symptoms entirely (mild symptoms, I assume). I'm really excited to see what more they discover as carnitine is being further studied. It might turn out to be a real game changer for animal-based diets!

Edit: Here's the youtube video that I mentioned, in case you're interested :)

m1gbonv,t1_m1fsu29,1garcab,"i noticed it maybe one year in. i'm lucky in that i always had great vision, but now i can read street signs from further away, and use tinier fonts. i don't know if it's just placebo, or my mind more efficiently 'upscaling' the input from my retinas, or optical nerve functioning slightly better, but i don't see how there could have been any improvement to the actual cones and rods on my retina. possibly more a product of eating more animal fats and cutting out seed oils than carnivore as a whole. possibly more vit A from liver. maybe my vision had gradually declined (in my 40s) and carnivore reversed it to an extent.




i know an old timer who has had his retinitis pigmentosa improve drastically since 2 years on carnivore (he couldnt see in the centre of his vision in one eye but now sees ""ok"" .. counter to professional advice that it doesn't get better)

lub4vwn,t1_lu7z9hz,1garcab,"Ha! I as well sing in a metal band which emphasizes clean melodic vocals with occasional moments of compressed grit and screaming elements.

l6uo1ls,t3_1d6lyij,1d6lyij,I've been running into people trying to push food on me and it's soo irritating. I'm not even fully carnivore yet working my way there. I'm simply eating less because all the protien I'm eating is making me less hungry. It makes people so uncomfortable when you aren't eating lol. It's like I'll eat when I'm hungry...,
l6uq454,t3_1d6lyij,1d6lyij,"I haven't run into this yet, because I've been slowly transitioning from Mediterranean to Carnivore over the last month. I have had one person ask me where I'm going to get my fiber. The fiber thing has been pushed on us for so long, people think it's essential to health. I tell them ""The same place the original Eskimos got their fiber -- nowhere.""",
l6w2bar,t3_1d6lyij,1d6lyij,"Carnivore seems very radical to most people. Everyone has been told and believes that red meat causes cancer, heart disease and diabetes, eggs are high in cholesterol and LDL cholesterol causes strokes. Vegetables and fruits are essential because of ""anti oxidants"" and fibre is essential. 

So when people see you doing the complete opposite of what all health organisations say they may be concerned and not see any harm in you consuming vegetables, grains etc. 

Most people think a carnivore diet is just where you eat lots of meat when really it is an elimination diet.",
l6ty2h4,t3_1d6lyij,1d6lyij,Well I've had this conversation with my parents too and they are just as perplexed.  I gave up lol...,

l6vy6oh,t3_1d6lyij,1d6lyij,It's because (as someone in their 40's) we have been drilled our whole lives to believe that will kill you. Even I thought Carnivore was insane until I tried it. What about Vitamin Deficiencies like Scurvy? Turns out those fears are unfounded if you really eat no nutrient sucking foods like Wheat and Rice. But no-one outside Carnivore knows that. They are think the Nutrition Science is both settled and sound when it is neither of those things. My GF and family all think I'm crazy and that if I don't come off it (or cheat regularly) that I will get Cancer or Heart-disease and they are trying to save me by pointing this out at every opportunity.,
l6vog2w,t3_1d6lyij,1d6lyij,I visit my mom every day. Every day I cook 2-3 pounds of burgers and most days a steak too. Every day she asks me what I'm going to eat lol,

My mum will literally try to give me canned tuna which was preserved in soy oil, which she knows knocks me out for up to 4 days, makes my face swell up and splits the skin, before turning it into a skin-based snow globe that is as itchy as poison ivy for a few weeks afterwards... & I still love her, but I am not going to eat that!

It is really bizarre to me. I wonder if it's just parents don't want to be told by their child ""X doesn't agree with me"" if that's not their personal experience with the food item... It still seems so strange, because they would surely respect it if they saw an allergic reaction take place.",

l76qtx5,t1_l6wwuza,1d6lyij,"I have spit the dummy and left before over how much care we took having lunch and then I was doing the dishes and she chucked in the can of tuna that was in soy oil...  We used to be able to eat them yes... It's a curious mix of habit, & fatigue (- because she won't take the supplements that would help her cos she thinks it's too many or doesn't like the taste), and her meds and diet cause brain fog- my opinion is that she probably has more allergies than she realises too... living in a stress-zone (she's a magnet for a lot of stuff and people who are hard work, so I personally limit my time with her out of a sad necessity)... being inobservant and a bad listener and not being in a zone where she personally feels like she has to read all the labels - though She should, being a coeliac and she used to, I learnt how to from her.

She knows what happens to me. I lived with her when it started happening... yet she is the reason why I know that you can't look after others unless you are looking after yourself properly.

In short my good hearted mum is a person who is totally codependent/ self love deficit disorder, who is running around after everyone else trying to take care of them, but not successfully looking after her own biggest needs.. but thankfully she is getting some help for that again these days.. From my observation of her, getting help for the codependency self-love-deficit issue is never a one and done. It always slips back or creeps in. Another lesson from watching her behaviour; Others should never give you your worth, or between your own ears, you become a total mess... Especially if you're doing some magical mind reading and trying to meet needs that nobody has asked you to meet! It's crazy, and from what I can see, it's probably exhausting!",

It's admirable how self-aware you are in terms of what you have learned from observing her while growing up. There's so much I have to work through with things I picked up from my parents about food and looking after your own health. It's crazy how food is an expression of our ability (or not) to look after ourselves and others. The codependent dynamic is extremely familiar, although for my folks the roles were reversed in terms of who was running around taking care of everyone else and sublimating their own needs.",
l78iwr2,t1_l76ukgt,1d6lyij,"Agree. I think you should always take all factors into account. If eating something doesn’t send you into allergic reactions and misery, I think a one-off is fine. But if it does, then you should avoid it in a way that is the lowest amount of stress for everyone involved. Fair?",
l7av2ob,t1_l79bt2e,1d6lyij,"Well, I'm middle aged now... I would get frustrated with some of these things as a child: She'd constantly put herself down, all lies or things that I now guess came from hyperfocussing on one thing rather than looking at the big picture. She would not have let any of us talk to anyone else like she did to herself... I remember being utterly furious and so confused as how do you defend someone from the bully when it is themselves, their own words?! My attempts as a child never worked.

 I (much) later realised that you won't change someone's mind just by telling them the truth if they are super attached to their own inner dialogue about it.

The verbal self body shaming she did was the next one I got frustrated with as I noticed it was not what she said she wanted to teach me, she must have read something to me about self image, I don't know how I would have known that the parents self image was meant to be something that their children could copy safely... I saw it was self defeating lies which didn't make sense. I only ever did a diet in my teens to appease her, but I totally recognised that she was trying to save me from the way she'd been bullied by subjecting me to the same attitudes and ideals, which was crazy and illogical, but I promised myself that whatever weight I ended up being, that I would love myself and not do the diet yoyoing that I saw for weight loss -I also realised that one day I would be able to choose my own foods. Portions she served were gigantic too, so in my teens when I was not having growth spurts, I would grab half my tea and take it to school to have for lunch the next day, as the portion size was immense - as a result I was well fed for both meals... Meant that I was able to cut the gluten that made me feel ick. Mum only cut 'all white foods out' if she was trying to loose weight. But in my teens I could see that she was clearly intolerant to some of the same things as me, only she didn't listen to her body's needs. Essentially she trained me to be a fat girl, and I chose different ways and didn't end up that way, because of some sort of nutrient absorption issues that I had from birth -in hindsight - I took after my dad there... but I had an expectation and peace with if I became fat but I unexpectedly had to work out how to juggle the unexpected opposite and put and keep on weight. And stay away from the allergens 😶‍🌫️ hence my hanging out here.",😶🌫

When told what his dad was doing for tea, you'd expect a light to go on, but these things happen too late sometimes... OP hasn't actually stated that carnivore diet is optional for him... He states that it's for health. This can be a subtle way of saying 'avoiding misery as you put it.'

I have autoimmune that is psoriasis based. I love bacon, good quality eggs, beef. Salt. Some spices. I tolerate heavy whipping cream with coffee. I may be ok with homemade grass fed ghee, cuz I can make sure to get all the lactose out.

kqhvrcv,t3_1ar7jq6,1ar7jq6,How long has it been since you changed your way of eating?  If it's been months then it sounds like you've lost a lot of visceral fat and intramuscular fat.  Now you will begin the (slower) process of losing the subcutaneous fat.,
kqis5nu,t3_1ar7jq6,1ar7jq6,"I’d say this is a hippy dippy post 😂yet I can fully appreciate it!! 

When I’m inflamed, back when I ate all the plants, and when I was falling off too many times at first with cookies and donuts, I could not feel my abs. Face was puffy, just an inflamed uncomfortable feeling. 

But just this morning laying in bed before I got up, i run my hand down my stomach and love feeling the subtle ab muscles on a non bloated, non gassy, non inflamed abdomen 😂but also yes, it’s like every movement I do, it is with full intention, better control, more meaning. Also cannot fully explain this but I’ve noticed it. Well done.",😂😂
kqj2jew,t3_1ar7jq6,1ar7jq6,"Two things happened.  

The reduction of carbs to near zero turns off the ""store store store"" signal.  That constant cellular pressure is reduced. 

The reduction of inflammation allows cells to do what they are supposed to do.  Cells do not want to signal pain to the brain.

So the best way I can describe what you and others are experiencing is a lack of the constant feeling of pressure.   Pressure on the brain, joints, organs, blood flow etc... 

Also your brain might thank you every now and then by releasing some natural GHB into the system.",
kqid0lo,t3_1ar7jq6,1ar7jq6,"I think the term for that is interoception. 

I switched to this way of eating not long ago and I feel it too. Its crazy I can feel blood running through my body, I feel my insides much more clearly.

Im not sure quite how to describe it either, it's as if because theres no inflammation, all your senses are much more attuned. it feels good just to be.",
kqj3qer,t3_1ar7jq6,1ar7jq6,"I agree with how you described the feeling and the awareness.   

Related to that, I don’t really have a desire to constantly eat like before.  
Before carnivore, when I felt hungry, like during my attempts at time-restricted eating , it felt like hell waiting for the fast period to be over. It was hard to focus on work. I was staring at the clock.  I was irritable. I felt like I was starving.

For the past 1.5 weeks, I sometimes feel hungry or even starving.  But I’m still comfortable and clear-headed. It’s a comfortable type of hunger. I’m not miserable and feeling deprived.  I feel like I could go another 3+ hours of the ‘hungry’ feeling without the drama of regular time-restricted eating.",
kqifup4,t3_1ar7jq6,1ar7jq6,I get this! I’m not even that far in but I really understand what you’re saying.,
kqj6d28,t3_1ar7jq6,1ar7jq6,Inflammation can mask your senses I think.,
kqj4vb6,t3_1ar7jq6,1ar7jq6,Yeah me too I am way more aware of all my muscles and joints and how they fit together and more in tune with what they need. And more sensitive to what I eat and how it affects everything,
kqj733p,t3_1ar7jq6,1ar7jq6,This is just a guess. You probably had a lot of visceral fat. So your body is finally shedding all the fat between your organs.,

I'm not sure what all those kinds of fat are but you can bet I'm now going to look it up my weight loss has slowed down which is fine by me I went on Carnivore not even to lose weight I went on it for my chronic pain and other issues but I'm so glad I'm losing weight and it feels really weird not taking up so much space in my body being able to move more freely. I'm hoping I can take care of the loose skin I've been reading ways to help that along but at the end of the day I'm going to be losing almost 200 lb from start to finish so there might not be anything I can do to completely alleviate it.,

kqjel39,t1_kqjdka0,1ar7jq6,I did Keto before and while I actually liked keto I can tell you a 100% like carnivore so much better the difference seems small but it feels large on keto I still always had a lot more cravings for things seems like even that little bit of extra carbs you get and a large variety of food actually work to your detriment. Since I've been on carnivore after the first couple of months the only time I ever want to eat anything that isn't carnivores sometimes I want cashew chicken or chicken strips but that's probably because that has been a staple in my life for like 40 years so I'm sure it's more of a thing in my brain than it is my body having a real craving LOL.,

Eggs are great not only cuz they are good amd cheap but they have a lot of vitamins and nutrients. 

I struggled with what to eat at first as well but I found that as you go you just naturally start gravitating towards the higher fat Meats even though before this I generally wasn't going for fat Meats I in fact didn't care for excessive fat but now I love it your taste buds will change. 

So my Approach would be more like the spaghetti against the wall approach start eating whatever different kind of meats you got access to and your body will quickly figure out what it enjoys the most but again beef is always King and brisket makes good ground beef.",

kqjkj8y,t1_kqjilrm,1ar7jq6,Also. What I eat often depends on what they have when I shop.  I shop about once every two days. Check out sales.  See what they have.  Nice way to have some variety and save $$,

kqjl7ib,t1_kqjku1b,1ar7jq6,It's pretty amazing I also stressed over what kind of foods to eat when I first started and it seems like it's really hard for anyone to talk about it but I think it's most likely because it's always just meet and I imagine a lot of people do the exact same thing where they just pick up whatever is available that day for a good price and make sure they get extra fat so you know keep making on hand and sausages in case you want to eat some leaner Meats as well,
kqjlm9s,t1_kqjlcse,1ar7jq6,Oh yes you can have all kinds of pork I don't do pork as much unless it's in the sausage form but that's just cuz I'm not much of a poor person that being said if pork's on sale I'm probably going to grab some. Also if you know any hunters or are a hunter there's a lot of good meat out there you can get outside of a grocery store.,

lsetk7u,t3_1g5t4zd,1g5t4zd,"Why would you go back to eating ""normal"" if you experience alleviation of symptoms on carnivore?
The suggested mechanism (that I have read of) is that you have running inflammation non-stop while eating plants, which means you have constant levels of anti-bodies going around.
 When  you quit plants for a while the inflammation goes away hence you don't have antibodies in circulation at all times and ingesting something triggering causes a bigger reaction because it takes time to activate the immune response that might dampen it a bit again.",

lsf00pg,t3_1g5t4zd,1g5t4zd,"So the carnivore diet reduces inflammation, and then includes inflammation in your sinus cavity, which obviously opens up your nasal passages and helps you breathe more easily when you go back on the standard American diet.

Realizing things about your body unfortunately take long periods of time and retrospective analysis, it's not something I knew instantly tbh.

lnckbsq,t3_1fh2884,1fh2884,"Don't forget electrolytes. I bought mine in capsules online. You can buy those fancy packets but they're expensive. What works best for me is taking one in the morning when I first get up because I don't eat for at least 6 hours, and then I take another one before I go to bed.

To make my meal prep easier, I pretty much just buy three main meats, and I put them in portions in little Ziploc bags and pull them out of the freezer the night before. I use an app to record all of my calories (Myfitnesspal app - subscription required), and I set it to 70% fat 30% protein. I set my target weight in the app, and it tells me how many calories to eat each day. It also accounts for exercise by giving you more calories. I generally put 300 G of pork belly in each baggie. I buy beef chuck roast, and I cut it into steaks and tenderize it, and I put 200 to 270 G in each baggie. I vary between chicken wings and chicken thighs and legs and try to stay in that same 300 G range.

I hate the taste of liver so to get the liver in my diet that is needed I take chicken liver grind it up and mix it with hamburger mix in some bacon and some spices a little bit of Parmesan cheese and make little balls out of them and freeze them and then I cook them about every other day. I put three little balls in a freezer bag. Yes, I know grammatically,  that was a horrible paragraph, sorry. Edit: Forgot the pulverized pork rinds

I cook all that stuff in the air fryer, and it's really simple.

Sometimes, I'll eat eggs because you need eggs. I try to incorporate boiled eggs and scrambled eggs as much as possible.

After you've been on the diet for a month go in and get tested for all your vitamin and mineral levels to find out where you are explain to the doctor what you're doing so you will get all the right tests. You're probably going to find that you're lacking in some areas, and this will allow you to adjust where you need to. For me, I needed to eat more liver and supplement with vitamin C.

Go to a butcher and buy beef fat trimmings and cut them into 1/4 in strips season them how you like and air fry them till they're slightly crispy. This will help you get your fat content up. I eat a lot of pork belly, but I get it at Costco, and it's quite lean, so I need to add some more fat back. A lot of people add butter. I just can't see myself eating sticks of butter.

 You're going to have a lot of things change for you. For example one of the big ones for me was I used to need seven and a half to eight and a half hours sleep no matter what now I can't sleep more than five and I feel fully rested every time like I've had a cup of coffee before I even got up.

Oh, and bathroom time is not going to be fun for the next month or two while all the gut Flora you no longer use dies off.

I hope this information helps it's what I discovered along my way and what I'm still experiencing. Good luck to you.",

Some of the early and most successful carnivores (Stefansson, Donaldson, Stanley) all forbid the use of salt and believed it caused people issues and was, ultimately, unhealthy. Carnivores in the animal kingdom do not consume salt. That's an herbivore trait.

In my experience, it seems like lightly salting food to taste rarely causes issues.  Anything beyond that is often a problem. Less is better. Personally, I have gone months without salt, and find that it's really not much different than lightly salting. So, I will lightly salt many foods, for taste.

Turns out carnivore was lower than the spanish diet in persistent pollutants. (due to the fish and seafood in the Spanish diet, but there were surprising amounts in the plant food components)

We don't tend to eat predators.

\[The cultures who lived ths way traditionally in the far north did include seal and polar bear and whale fat -- but that was before the pollution from the southern cultures. They eat smaller quantities now, since it does not form the mainstay of their diet. their quantity of persistent pollutants they have in theiir tissues has probably been studied, may try to look up later -- they are one of the if not the most studied populations in the world, and have put restrictions and frameworks around new research.\]",

But, even meat cooked to medium is just fine for avoiding scurvy. And, unless you're only eating meat that has been cooked to death and dry, it's not a concern.

Cook your meat how you like it. Less cooking is best, and most people will move in that direction, but raw is not required and no one is forcing people to eat meat that is dangerously undercooked.",

it was contingent upon conditions -- it was useful when eating mixed diets with fowl.

in the north, when animal foods were plentiful, liver was thrown to the dogs.

and yes, if people like it, they should include 3 - 4 oz a week, avoids problems. 

sometimes people are starting with low iron and deficient in other nutrients, due to previous malabsorption from their GI condition or die to their prediabetes, T2D. In those cases, it falls under ""take supplements as prescribed until the deficiency is cleared up"". Liver may be the only supplement needed. 

If the iron or B12 deficiency is more severe, and they need supplements or IV treatments, liver still helps woth the ansorption & utilization of iron and B12 supplements.

If it's just happening when you're searing the steak, which is valid, then wear a cooking apron for your slacks. If you wear long sleeve shirts then you might get a bit of splatter, but if I'm going to sear on high heat I just pull off my dress shirt. You can also use an air fryer and completely alleviate all of this and it does a great job of cooking and it's very easy and quick. 

**When eating:** you are probably eating with poor posture. Sit at a table, sit up straight while cutting your food, then lean forward and take the bite with your mouth over your plate.

It’s called an apron and eating with utensils with your mouth over the plate 😂

Seriously you should invest in some good Aprons cooking carnivore is not any more difficult than any other type of cooking 🍳 it’s all about your ingredients, prep & execution.

Watch some cooking videos about preparation getting your space right, using the right cooking tools and methods. You shouldn’t be getting lots of grease on your clothes you might have your heat source too high and might be using too much oil.

🥋 (As for the stains on your clothes old fashioned methods still work if you don’t have stain remover to quickly spray your stained clothes try quickly using soda water and baking soda with a bit of detergent it’s basically the same ingredients as the over the counter stain removers acting fast is important otherwise your clothes are probably permanently damaged. On a positive note in the absence of an Apron you can now cook in your stained clothing )😂

Good luck 🍀",😂🍳🥋😂🍀

Worth pointing out that nutritional epidemiology doesn't always find a correlation between red meat and colorectal cancer, ""Red and processed meat isn't associated with colorectal cancer in Asia, where it's a health food and food of the wealthy rather than the poor."" -- George Henderson comment on this study, https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/10408398.2018.1495615?journalCode=bfsn20

Don't ever let people dictate your lifestyle choices based on their good intentions!

The road to hell is paved with good intentions. 

Your positive experience should be more than enough confirmation that eating a carnivore diet is what works for you.

Since no one is living your life for you, they shouldn't interfere with your choices, especially your dietary choices as they do not have their skin in the game. 

What is good for them cannot be thrown out there and universally accepted as good for everyone on this planet. 

They do not have any competence to talk about nutrition, nor do they have the courage to try it out for themselves and subconsciously they feel bad for this and somehow, they feel as not being enough and they feel left behind. But not one of them will ever admit to this, as it takes a certain level of maturity and integrity to do so.

And to counteract this, in their laziness, they chose the easiest route which is to detract you by various tactics, so that you can get back to their level so they can feel good about themselves.  And all of this is done more or less unconscious.

Whether the populations were eating omnivorous diets or diets wholly of animal source foods, they did not have these chronic ""western diseases"" until the storage foods came along.

Go through the medical anthropology, start with the references in Gary Taubes' Good Calories Bad Calories, pp 89 - 99, the Diseases of Civilization chapter.

Here he is talking about that research, at the 12m55s-17m30s section of Biomed Central Metabolism, Diet and Disease Conference, The Obesity-Cancer Connection Panel, : https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EffpuKqWWF8 (the section starts a minute and a half earlier, at the 11m30s mark, talking about insulin sensitizing)

Burkitt & Trowell's work -- ""Diseases of Westernization"" includes some of the observations about the variation in the presence of chronic diseases between different populations. Burkitt mistakenly thought it was the fiber that made the difference, even though he knew about Inuit experience and that it was similar to the other H-G groups: that the chronic western diseases (incl cancer) were rare to non-existent on their traditional diets before the introduction of the storage foods. He omitted the Inuit experience when forming his hypothesis because he had a preference for the fiber hypothesis. But despite a diet of little to no fiber, Inuit also did not have the chronic Western diseases until the introduction of storage foods.

A more coherent hypothesis would have been that the addition of the storage foods was the problem and the fiber, if it did anything, was an improvement only because it displaced the storage foods. (that hypothesis is more coherent, but also not a great hypothesis, because fiber can make things worse, see: https://www.reddit.com/r/ketoscience/wiki/fiber. If you go through Burkitt's lifetime of research, it wasn't convincing for the fiber hypothesis, the idea was compelling, but the outcomes were not.

but it changes how my meal is metabolized -- which matters at a high level of intake.  

i'm a size larger when i include it, (8 - 10 at 5'6"", instead of size 8 being almost too big) but the gain happens quickly, some kind of hormonal shift, and then i'm size stable, have been for years. 

i include it anyway most of the time because i like it and i still have a good waist to height & waist to hip ratio. 

also when i don't have it, my appetite & metabolism revs up, assuming due to lower overall insulin secretion, meaning i'd have to eat more to stay at same weight, so it's more cost effective to include it 😂",😂

 I don't buy it from a supermarket and I don't have a butcher shop (that is not in a supermarket) nearby.   I go to the Amish market and it's quite fresh. I've asked them about their sources and it seems they get it from their own cattle. At least the Amish farms close to where I shop do... That may not be the case in other areas of the country, but I've noticed that everything in the meat section of any Amish market in my area (there are 3 close by) looks very very fresh. 

I trust my own taste buds and my nose. I can tell when it's fresh. Naturally, we can't always tell if something is contaminated, but I've never ever had a problem getting sick. Never! 

A good amount of salt and pepper. That's all I put on it. I let it come down to room temperature rather than eating it straight out of the fridge. Cold fat doesn't have a lot of flavor and the texture and 'mouth feel' isn't as pleasant. Better to have it slightly warmer.",

chop it coarsely, presto safe ground beef, add egg yolk for tartare :) 

in France, (maybe also Germany?) you can buy ground beef in the supermarket that is marked as specifically meant to be eaten as tartare. 

pls avoid doing that unless its marked as such  -- we know of people who had to have hospital stays with IV antibiotics bc they became so sick after eating ground beef, (even organic, grassfed yada yada yada from a pricey place).

Walmart sells an 8 pound box of 100% beef frozen patties for $27. If you eat a pound per night then that's $3.38 per night.

Walmart also sells a 60 count box of eggs for whatever the going rate for eggs is... I've seen it as low as $7 and as high as $25... We bought eggs the other day and the price is at $19 in my area right now.

The eggs could be very cheap or very expensive due to the fluctuation in prices, but if it's too expensive then just don't buy them. They aren't necessary, they're just more of a perk.

If you can afford some great value unsalted butter... Then boom you're in business.

I figure I'm saving money in the long term. I've dramatically reduced my medical costs, and I don't ever throw out food anymore. The calmness and mental clarity that comes with carnivore means I make less impulsive purchases and I find contentment easier. I don't go out to eat or order delivery nearly as often anymore. Without joint pain I walk more often and farther than before. I'm not anemic anymore, so I'm no longer freezing cold all the time. This means I'm outside longer and I'm lowering my utility bills because my tolerance of cold has gone waaaaaay up and I've programmed my thermostat to kick on the heat at a slightly lower temp.

If you're in the US, make sure you're signed up for your grocery store's app. Maximize points and coupons. The other day I was able to get a ribeye roast for less than $7 per pound, just because I checked the Albertsons app for 10 seconds. If you've got a decent-sized freezer, you can look for direct-to-consumer beef options near you.

They are like 2-3 inches long & fully my natural color, so it isn't just weird widespread breakage (thankfully lol).

I feel *fairly* confident it coincided with my transition to stricter carnivore... however, when I did the switch, I also increased my calories quite a bit: my protein didn't change much, but carbs went to near 0 & I stopped worrying about regulating my fat intake.

Since your skin develops from the inside out, it can take some time to see results. It was probably more than two months in to carnivore before I saw a noticeable difference in my complexion. Also one way your body can dump oxalates is out through the pores, so I've heard of people whose complexion got worse (initially) on carnivore.

So at the optometrist, I asked her how much worse have they gotten? She said they're not worse, they're significantly better! She seemed confused, and asked me if my last prescription was problematic.

My mom (60) has had Hashimoto’s, diagnosed in her 30’s, and has been extremely overweight with a pretty bad food addiction for quite some time now, just about my entire life (I’m 28). 

They both have been carnivore since Jan. 1 of this year. 

Since then, my dad has experienced:
- So much energy he does 100 push ups/sit ups every day
- Wakes up at 4:30am every day with a pep in his step
- His optometrist was BLOWN AWAY that she had to REDUCE his eye glasses prescription after decades!
- Has to cut his blood pressure pill in half, IF he feels he needs to take it that day (has gone some time without it now) because his blood pressure has been so perfect you’d think he’s 20
- Easily building muscle mass
- Had to turn down his hearing aids (like you said, better hearing/less wax)
- Chronic knee joint pain has disappeared
- He claims that, at the beach, he didn’t sunburn like usual (he was there sitting in the sun for 2 weeks) 

My mom has experienced:
- Less thyroid related flair ups & pain
- Thicker hair
- BEAUTIFUL skin
- Like dad, starts the day at 4:30am bright eyed and bushy tailed
- No more need for naps - this one was HUGE because she always took 2-3 naps every day and was very sluggish 
- A completely new outlook on life and is much more positive
- And oh yeah.. SHE’S LOST 100 POUNDS after decades and decades of fad diets and discouragement 🥲🥹

I am so thankful for the carnivore diet. My (adult) siblings and I feel like we’ve gotten our mom back. We see dad falling in love with mom all over again (even though she knows he never gave up on her). I am just SO happy for my parents!",🥲🥹

If you happen to get a private consult with a doctor that promotes carnivore, which I have, and you still have medical issues, the solution is going to be: cut back on the fat/extra calories exercise more/add strength training.

You just end up paying thousands of dollars and hear the same thing: fix your food, exercise more, more strength training. And every time you pay $250 or $300 for the consult you will hear that advice, until it finally sinks in. So then I noticed my blood pressure started going up and got another consult. Result: Hey, there's a lot of fat on your liver, you need to cut back on fat and exercise more. And it worked! Had I done that to start with I could have avoided the problem and saved myself the money. 

Yes, they are selling a ""program"" but it's just so that the message sinks in. If you want I can just tell you what the are going to say and you can save the money and ignore the ads.

keep in mind, this is different than a stanard diet, on this way of eating people maintain muscle and bone density even when sedentary.

the advice here and of the longest runninig zerocarb forum, Zeroing In On Health, is to wait until you feel like exercising as a sign of restored health.

there are a few reasons for this

- one reason is that exercising too early can worsen some conditions. there has been a lot more awareness of this since longcovid, eg https://longcovid.physio/our-work/who-long-covid-rehab-guidelines, but other communities (ME/CFS, MS) knew that exercise was not always a good thing.

- another reason is that it takes energy and resources in order to fight infection and illness and to repair damaged tissues. (resources meaning the fatty acids from fat and the amino acids from protein)the damage can be considerable -- eg for someone with a GI problem, the surface area of the GI tract, including the villi in the intestinal tract, is the same as the surface area of a tennis court! (per Dr. Alessio Fasano, expert in celiac disease). Another example is burn patients who require about 7500 calories a day for the restoration of tissue. Obv less serious conditions don't require as much, but needing to balance intake and exertion while the body is restoring tissues is a real consideration. Having the impulse to exercise is a great sign the body is ready to shift into a new gear and the person should be mindful of needing to eat more when they first get back to it.

- a third reason is that the inflammation and higher histamine levels that come with exercise (which is normal and productive, part of how the body recovers from exerise and how the stimulus of exercise gets converted into being more adapted for it) can aggravate the person's health condition. Whether it is from dietary histamine or the histamine in the post-workout session, it gets added to the baseline histamine levels and tends to go where the inflammatory fires were already burning. Some people will do it anyways, if its minor, like a mild flare of their skin condition. But people recovering from, say a painful GI condition or migraines, won't want to deal with it quite yet. They can find a level of exercise where it is better, not high enough histamines to trigger a reaction, or just wait.

- for people who are very heavyset, the work of moving around their frame is plenty of stimulus and finally, on this diet, that can be converted into muscle and bone density gains. their previous types of diets prevented that (there can be sarcopenic obesity). they don't need to force exercise, but also should wait until the impulse to do it arrives. the general experience is that it is sometime after 6 months - 1 year on this diet and have lost some weight. Again, while not doing forced, deliberate exercise they are getting lots of stimulus just from moving their extra weight around through their day to day.

***

tl;dr this way of eating should be studied for the way that muscle mass can be maintained even when sedentary.

when I started I was very sedentary because i had a severe anemia, yet went down a size at the same weight over my first 7 months of doing this way of eating, eating heartily.

had another period of being sedentary, years into this way of eating, when i had longcovid. when i went back to the gym after 18 months, my lifts were where I had left them. that didn't used to happen even on a keto diet.

the newer influencers don't know this, the poorly moderated sites and subreddits about carnivore don't know it either.

but the one that have been around a while and helped thousands do.",

I used to eat 2 sausage egg and cheeses with hashbrowns and a couple of donuts in the morning. Lunch would be a couple of burgers, nuggets, and fries from fast food. Dinner was normally decent for SAD, a lot of meat, but a ton of potatoes and veggies. In between meals I would grab chips, a slice of pizza and or hot dogs at 7-11 still lol. 

No one ever once commented on me being unhealthy despite being 340 lbs, plagued with skin tags being prediabetic and looking like my eyes were swollen shut from inflammation lol. I tried Mediterranean diet, low fat, fasting, etc. Once I started to only eat 2.5 lbs of 80/20 with shredded cheese daily I lost tons of weight, lowered my blood pressure, skin tags all falling off, and can tie my shoes without getting out of breath. Then people became concerned with me clogging my arteries and tell me i am killing myself. I told them no problem I will become “healithy” again by going back to spending hundreds of dollars more a month on food by eating out, gain all the weight back, and raise my blood pressure again. It is how I have handled every interaction with family/friends and they all understood where I was coming from and agreed that I am on the right track",

At gatherings and family events I can say I'm doing low carb/keto (or just that I'm avoiding sugar, etc) keeping my and just sticking to meat because 'everything else looks too tempting today'.  If I'm in mixed company, I explain that I've been lifting heavy/strength training and need to prioritize my protein because I haven't been as hungry lately...and then I push other food around on my plate or take some home with me 'to have later'.

And if you are worried, if what they say is getting to you, then it might be because you haven't done enough research on this diet yet. In which case you should. Contrary to the ""just eat meat and shut up"" mentality some people propagate, it's always a good idea to properly educate yourself on anything you do. To fully understand why this diet is much healthier than a standard one. So if you're unsure if too much protein might really be bad for you in the long term, or that high cholesterol will kill you, or of anything else that random people might throw at you, then you should look into those things. Understand why those things are not a problem. If you do then you should have no problem ignoring those kind of remarks. And you'd actually be able to educate some people who are open minded enough about how our diet really affects us.

And I'd wager that people would stop giving you their uninformed ""advice"" if they got to see that you actually know what you're doing. Instead of just trying out this crazy diet that you're heard about on the net. If you can explain to them why all of their arguments are invalid, then they won't bother bringing up more of them. And some of them might even decide to try it out as well.

So educate yourself. On everything that matters to you. And if there's people who are stuck with any beliefs and just don't want to hear anything you might have to say, anything that goes against their beliefs, ignore them. Those are generally not people you'd want to get involved with anyway. If it's someone close to you then they should at least know to keep their opinions to themselves, after you've made it clear that you're not interested and don't appreciate them trying to lecture you.

And your results are going to be the proof in the blood pudding, eventually. If you are still eating poorly, high-absorption chemicals as in Coke or megacarby pastries or anything else that's not recognizable as an actual food, then ask us about cravings and finding balance.

I have great(similar) weight loss results but I'm still trying to eat as much as possible(no fasting) cause I truly feel my body is still healing and feel 1% better every day and probably wont stop eating as much until 90 days in.

They had these omelets and cups of cream cheese by the beagles so I’d always put it in the omelets and it was delicious. Sometimes they had bacon too and that made it even better.,
lso2q7m,t3_1g5vbok,1g5vbok,Cream cheese in scrambled eggs or omelet makes creamy eggs. And easy to make glad youvlike it,
lshlrdp,t3_1g5vbok,1g5vbok,I usually put some oregano in my eggs and I cook in ghee. Cheddar on top. Recently trying it out with mutton liver. It's pure bliss,

They were surprised to find the inside very clean, but on further investigation, said that my eardrums were very ""dull"" (as in not reflecting much light back). The DR suggested that it may be build up due to allergies, and suggested I took anti histamines to see if that helped.

Perhaps you have been having mild allergic reactions to certain food groups, raising your histamine levels. Now that you've eliminated this, you've been less inflamed.

I have been suffering with vertigo and severe hearing loss for 2 years! 

I’m one week into carnivore, and I’m in ketosis. I have discovered dairy was a huge culprit. 

I’m curious, how bad was your hearing and how much did it improve on the diet? 

Your post gave me SO much hope!! ",
kvasyma,t3_1bh0z1j,1bh0z1j,"I haven't noticed that in particular, but somewhere on this forum I read that excessive earwax is often a sign of inflammation. So maybe Carni has helped to shift your earwax production into the normal range, therefore better hearing.

I’ve done a few experiments trying to add specific carbohydrates back in and it’s never amounted to anything positive. I always find myself right back here. Once I start adding in other things, alopecia, psoriasis, migraines, panic attacks and cystic acne all come back with a vengeance.

kvavej9,t1_kvatte1,1bh0z1j,"Well maybe it’s different for people - the eyes I think might be something with insulin not affecting the retina (if I remember correctly but might mixed that up) and if your problem is the cornea that might just stay the same :/

It’s funny that you have the smell thing too - maybe it’s a woman thing? Would love more feedback from others. I didn’t notice any big changes there but I always have had the problem of being annoyed with smells.

Maybe we should start a poll to see what’s the most common things to improve… I find that really interesting. I got the feeling that my personality also changed quite a bit but that might also just be due to the fact that it’s so crazy for how long I believed this crazy plant propaganda 😂",😂
kvdfn5c,t1_kvatte1,1bh0z1j,Do you eat high fat carnivore? Because high fat helps eye sight in some cases since eyes (besides your brain) require a lot of fat since that is what they are mostly made of.,

kvawfqr,t1_kvavej9,1bh0z1j,"Yes! That would be super interesting to do a poll! It’s insane what this diet has done for so many people. I’ve had many other major health improvements. But I just noticed that my hearing was back. I don’t even know when it happened I guess because it was so gradual. My jaw dropped when I realized haha. 

And maybe! When the smell thing first hit me, I felt like I was part wolf or something 😂 all the smells were so apparent. Ones I’d never noticed before. Definitely feeling carnivorous lol.",😂

I'm curious what you use to shred the beef.  I've tried a couple different food processors, but only the small one I've got is capable of pulverizing the beef enough.  My much larger Ninja XL (with a more powerful motor) just can't do it for some reason and the final product comes out really ""grainy"" and rough.  The blender technically works, but all that shredded beef just gets stuck in the bottom and it's very hard to use for large quantities.",

I use a Cuisinart glass jar blender but most do the pulse button to keep the heat from friction to a minimum.
I stop and empty the jar into a large wooden bowl and repeat through the rest of the dry pieces... The texture of the blended meat is powder plus fibrous and contains an occasional small clump the size of peppercorns perhaps. Once I pour in the warm (not hot) tallow slowly in the equal weight of the bowl, mixing and stirring with a wooden spoon... The end result is similar to dry oatmeal perhaps, I spread it in the Pyrex dish, then I always sprinkle some coarse salt and sometimes add strips of cold Bacon and allow it to adhere to the soft surface before covering with parchment paper then plastic lid and cool it right down overnight.

I did a lot of meal prep in advance on Sundays, I would pre-smoke like half a dozen big blade steaks or pre-cook a bunch of ground beef so it was quick and easy to reheat in the air fryer.

My husband is doing this with me, and he hasn't noticed any changes yet but I'm sure they'll show up.",
l7s30g6,t1_l7rx3bu,1daorc3,"Yes of course!

When we started we had 1kg of meat each ready for us to consume. I also tried to have a variety of things because when you’re transitioning to carnivore you think you’re missing out on variety but it’s just a mind game really.

So my breakfast is always, always, bacon and eggs. Cooked in bacon fat, with butter added for taste. Salt and pepper seasoning. I drink 3litres of electrolyte water a day. I do still have a coffee but it’s an espresso with some steamed milk or heavy cream. No sugar.

Lunch is usually a “snack”. This could be jerky, boiled eggs, or cheese chips. But if I’m not hungry I just wait until til dinner (which tbh seems to be what my body is enjoying.)

Dinner is steak with butter, and I always have something else like a fried egg or a few bocconcini balls or sour cream or something. 

We have ribeye, rump and eye fillet, brisket from beef. We do pork belly, loin chops and pork mince. Chicken breast and thigh, salmon and wild caught snapper. Eggs. Cheese, sour cream, and a dash of milk for coffee.

We eat bacon, eggs and steak every day. We alternate with another protein for those meals as mentioned above.

Additionally, our bodies have naturally moved to a fasted model. We eat breakfast at noon, and by 6pm we’ve finished eating.",
l7s2fqq,t1_l7rtfoo,1daorc3,"When we finally stopped eating sugar all together it was a solid 4-5 days before the cravings totally went away. To curb this though I had heaps of “snacks” - salami, bacon, speck, cheese, jerky, boiled eggs etc. this might not be the “norm”, but I had to find a way to stop the cravings. It then made me realise my “hunger” was false and just a sugar craving. Once all that stuff from the sugar gets out of your body you could sit in a lolly shop and not even blink if someone shoved lollies in front of your face. That’s how stark the difference is.

I found that during this phase when I thought I was hungry and went and grabbed one of my snacks I actually wasn’t hungry at all. I then waited and waited until my body was really hungry. Many hunger signals came a good 3-4 hrs after that initial sugar one. If I ate during the sugar hunger I would take a bite and then be like, “wait, I’m not even hungry.”

That’s how I learnt what the difference of that felt like in my body.",

Take joy in trying different types of salts, I made a blue cheese butter to put on the steaks. One!  So much flavor.  but get a nice salty butter and add a great blue cheese crumble.  

I love Parmesan on top of over medium eggs quite often.  I used to eat that over rice, but now it could be over some leftover cuts.  

The other day we made short ribs.  They were huge and we had plenty left over.  

I make a little trick which is funny, but mentally I like it.  I make salmon tacos.   Just a nice flavorful wild salmon, cut and played on top of a corn taco shell— I make three.   Then I just eat my tacos with a fork.  I only eat the salmon but they were plated as tacos and to me, I had tacos!   I make others the tacos.  They eat the whole tacos.   I “left a bit of food on my plate” is all.  Couldn’t finish it.  Or didn’t want to. I was full.   It’s still y sometimes what I find myself doing but I’ve been carnivore for not too long.  Maybe one day these little mind tricks will be forgotten.  

Oh.  Another one.  I now go to Starbucks and just get a trenta ice water.  Double ice.  I carry that around with my friends at work that have Starbucks.   Or when someone goes there and asks what I want, that’s my order.  I did carry my water jug for a bit but the Starbucks practice was strong. So I replaced it with a water visit.

There is no scientific evidence meat causes the health issues they claim. Hong Kong and Japan are a few of several good examples of healthier eating including lots of meat and eggs and longer life and less health issues.

> the unbelievable vast majority eat 1-3 lbs depending on body weight.

This is exactly why we don't want advice for teens, because this is the impression people have, and it's horribly wrong for adults. It's worse for teens.

Absolutely no successful, long-term, weight stable carnivore is eating one pound a day. That amount is insufficient for anyone. Even the tiny old post-menopausal woman, who is trying to lose weight, needs at least 1.5 pounds to get proper nutrition and still lose. Everyone else needs more.

As for a man? A man trying to go from 210 -> 165 lbs was prescribed the following **weight-loss diet.**

>I had told him that some executive ability was a great help in weight reduction, and because he was the chief chemist in a large organization he must have some of that quality. For fifteen weeks he would be required to eat enough of a big fat steak broiled with pepper, but no salt, and a demitasse of black coffee, to show a gain of at least one half pound on an accurate scale directly after completion of the meal. That probably meant that a porterhouse **steak should weigh about one and a half pounds to begin with. This meal was to be eaten three times a day.**

Personally, I eat about three pounds a day to remain weight stable. I often plan around buying two pounds of meat, because I don't count eggs/cheese/cream in the pounds. And, I will just go buy more if I need it. I don't get in to specifics, but I am not a very large person and my physical activity levels are very similar to carnivores with periods of intense activity followed by long periods of rest. It's why I am very comfortable telling the people who are running 5k each morning and doing 5 intense hour-long workouts a week that they're tired because they're eating way too little at only 2-3 pounds a day.

People come here with calories and restriction on their mind and don't know how to eat to just be healthy and maintain weight.

Then we get in to the fact that teens are burning excess calories through growth and change. They do need more and on the higher end of the calorie scale. A teen eating 2 pounds a day, because that's what an adult with a suppressed metabolism said was right on the internet, is going to end up sick and undernourished. And, anyone eating a pound a day, even if they want to lose weight, will get sick and fail.

I think it can if the child has health issues to cure but otherwise I do believe kids need some variation into their diet with properly prepared carbs.

I just can’t get them to sit still long enough to eat enough, and half the time they don’t want it as an only meal.

But right now I'm consuming 2lbs of ground beef a day with about 7-8 tablespoons of tallow and/or butter. I also have two bowls of bone broth I make at home. With this I hit around 2600-3k calories. Do you think I still need to be eating more? I dropped a significant amount of weight due to my autoimmune condition and am slowly putting it back on but I find it so difficult (and expensive) to be eating more than 2lbs a day.

l10v85h,t1_l0zs072,1cbjfaq,"yes. but this diet *is* anabolic, in the sense that people gain muscle and increase bone density  on it. 

But teens need so much more food. 

And what we know of traditional cultures, the first stage of growth there is the anabolic insulin stimulus from nursing that goes along with the meat & fish eating. 

There's that plus not knowing how traditional cultures handled those years after weaning for kids and teens -- eg did they prioritize berries in season for them. gathering lots and letting the kids & teens have most, the way we give more fruits and starches to our teens? growth spurts are seasonal, would the availability of berries and other carbohydrates correlated with those times and supported the growth spurt? Were there organs they knew fast growing teens did better with when they were included because of the extra nutrition?

l151qm0,t1_l12iyde,1cbjfaq,"I don't know exactly how big you are. So for you that might be a good weight loss amount. I tend to agree with Donaldson in the sense that to really lose weight you have to keep stoking the furnace. And he recommends that you eat three relatively equal sized meals each day to do so. He recommends about 700 calories minimum for each of those meals, and encourages you to eat more at a meal if you feel like it. That he says will keep your metabolism high and burning all that food, while maintaining an adequate amount of nutrition to keep your body at optimal pace.


One thing I recommend everyone eating this way look at, is the Minnesota starvation experiment. You'll see that they took young men and put them on diets of 1600 to 1800 calories a day, and not a high level of activity. And they did this for 24 weeks. The effects on their metabolism and on their mental state or dramatic especially with how negative those effects were. These diets were also low in protein and high in starches and carbohydrates. Very similar to your conventional weight loss diets. People put themselves on these diets and then expect to be able to do that for a year to lose weight and wonder why they get so sick and the metabolism goes to hell.


Eating less is a fool's game.


When I was losing weight eating carnivore, I was eating about 1,800 to 2,000 calories a day without even trying or tracking. And I was losing weight faster and easier than when I was eating 1500 calories a day on your standard diet. And I found after eating the standard diet, that I would gain weight if I was eating 1800 calories or more a day. It had lowered my metabolism to the point where I couldn't eat normally. Like I mentioned the other post these days, I eat approximately 3,000 calories a day and maintain my weight without a problem. Some days I may eat more, and some days I may less. But I always eat way more than people expect.",

but why? why would they want to? 

Another group that has a phase of an animal source foods only diet, the Maasai males during their Moran warrior stage, the teens will take in so much milk that they are getting over 1.5lbs of butter fat a day. Which gets back to the quantities needed for teens. 

This is an evolutionarily conserved possibility, useful when needed but most people don't need it. 

As the Ben-Dor, Sirtoli, and Barkai paper, The evolution of the human trophic level during the Pleistocene illustrated, there was an initial phase during our evolution when fatty megafauna were plentiful, and a later one which included other foods. 

Depending on their degree of metabolic damage from typical diets, ppl can get healthy on anything from a modified atkins to a well formulated ketogenic diet.

For two, the way of life involved a lot of work. Stefansson found that they were robustly healthy, he tells of one of the guys they were travelling with running beside the sled for the 24 hour journey.

Some of the hunting involved long trips of tracking. And once the catch was found, there was work to gather it and bring it back. Seals, they are hundreds of pounds. 350 - 700 lbs or so and have to be pulled out of the water and then transported all the way back to the shelter.

The demands of hunting also involved explosive energy and they had games and ways of training for that. One of them is jumping up, starting from a kneeling position -- emulating what's necessary when you are hauling in a seal and polar bear comes along to steal it and you have to jump out of the way.

Their day didn't involve driving or strolling to the grocery store to pick up a couple pounds of beef in climate controlled environments.

From one of his accounts, the group that stored up weeks and weeks worth of fatty fish and bags of mammalian fat to have during the coldest times, when it was -40 - 50 and stormy, they would eat less as the temperature in the igloo was quite comfortable, and they were sheltering indoors, not hunting.",

This is exactly why we don't want advice for teens, because this is the impression people have, and it's horribly wrong for adults. It's worse for teens.

Absolutely no successful, long-term, weight stable carnivore is eating one pound a day.  That amount is insufficient for anyone.  Even the tiny old post-menopausal woman, who is trying to lose weight, needs at least 1.5 pounds to get proper nutrition and still lose.  Everyone else needs more.

As for a man? A man trying to go from 210 -> 165 lbs was prescribed the following **weight-loss diet.**

>I had told him that some executive ability was a great help in weight reduction, and because he was the chief chemist in a large organization he must have some of that quality. For fifteen weeks he would be required to eat enough of a big fat steak broiled with pepper, but no salt, and a demitasse of black coffee, to show a gain of at least one half pound on an accurate scale directly after completion of the meal. That probably meant that a porterhouse **steak should weigh about one and a half pounds to begin with. This meal was to be eaten three times a day.** 

Personally, I eat about three pounds a day to remain weight stable. I often plan around buying two pounds of meat, because I don't count eggs/cheese/cream in the pounds. And, I will just go buy more if I need it. I don't get in to specifics, but I am not a very large person and my physical activity levels are very similar to carnivores with periods of intense activity followed by long periods of rest. It's why I am very comfortable telling the people who are running 5k each morning and doing 5 intense hour-long workouts a week that they're tired because they're eating way too little at only 2-3 pounds a day.

People come here with calories and restriction on their mind and don't know how to eat to just be healthy and maintain weight.

Then we get in to the fact that teens are burning excess calories through growth and change. They do need more and on the higher end of the calorie scale. A teen eating 2 pounds a day, because that's what an adult with a suppressed metabolism said was right on the internet, is going to end up sick and undernourished.  And, anyone eating a pound a day, even if they want to lose weight, will get sick and fail.",

Another way I’ve seen people woefully overestimate the amount of fat they’re eating is when they rely a lot on whole cuts of meat (like steaks) and just go by the fat content listed on the nutrition label. The actual fat content of the meat they bought could be substantially less than what’s listed on the nutrition label, there’s not a lot of consistency when it comes to whole cuts.

This is not normally how burgers are eaten, so for people new to the diet (which I’m assuming OP is) it might not occur to them to pour the fat back on top of the burger. Further more pouring liquid fat on top doesn’t always guarantee that it stays on top of the burger and makes it into your mouth which is why some people let the rendered fat cool & solidify to smear on top of the burger or eat as is. Again, might not be something that occurs to people brand new to do.

So im cooking patties (in tallow and butter mix) which fall apart easily because no flour in the mix... I lift out the nicely cooked patties and then I leave all the lumps and bumps of the beef patty detritus in the render.. I make sure there's plenty of meat left in the pan.
Then I pour that into a square glass dish and put it into the fridge. When it's hard I cut it into squares and snack on it. It's so delicious especially when I've used chilli and paprika seasoning with salt and white pepper. I do it when I've chopped up left over cold beef or lamb to fry up also..
 I leave a good portion in the pan to make the tallow snack because it's difficult to eat plain chilled fat, and the little chunks of meat taste wonderful surrounded by all that fat. Just sayin",
m3dzl6d,t1_m3dr440,1hkcl3p,"You *can* but in my experience when the fat is still liquid it doesn’t really stay on top of the burger that well and just spills off onto the plate. So I typically let the fat cool & solidify then smear it on top of the cooled burger (so it doesn’t reliquify). I smear butter on my burgers too, on one side goes butter on the other side goes the cooled tallow. Delicious.

If you’re too impatient to let the fat cool you can always use it as a “dipping sauce” or something. That’s what I do on the rare occasion that I want a piping hot burger. 
Either that or melted butter",

Is it different in texture to a jar of lard?",

ktnwvhr,t1_kthlbhg,1b75ljn,"We use same word and usually ""slanina"" means bacon and for pure fat version I heard ""slanina z mangalice"" but I'm not sure if it's general term or it referred only to the specific piece I dealt with.",
ktgkg9a,t1_ktgk8jr,1b75ljn,I see it sold online too but it’s definitely cheaper locally. About $12/lb for Ukrainian salo in NY,
ktn6wg0,t1_ktn5xw0,1b75ljn,"It doesn’t apply to salo. It’s not raw, it’s cured with salt. Salt “cooks” it with no heat. There are many ways of cooking fish and meat. Heat is just one of them. Marinating is another, salt curing is another. 

As for tallow, just go to any butcher and ask them to sell you beef fat. They usually trim it off their cuts of meat and throw it away anyway. 

After that just make your own. It’s super simple :)",
ktk4mr5,t1_ktk3eir,1b75ljn,"Very different. Lard is a spread (not something I’d spread on anything but it’s spreadable), salo is a deli meat. You slice it, slices hold their shape, you have to bite into it :). That’s the best way I can describe it",

Mainly suited for pan frying as grilling will be a cluster\*\*\*\* unless you have a broiler, which works pretty well but I like the pan the best. Make a good cream sauce afterwards with all the fat.

Slice it thinly, season/marinate it overnight, stick it in a low oven or dehydrator for several hours. Stupid simple. Lean meat is best unless you refrigerate it because the fat could go rancid if it's room temp. 

I have made Crack Jerky (Youu Tube) but without any sugars (if it even had any, I can't remember the recipe). For carnivore, omit any and all seasonings you don't feel comfortable with including.

It's really easy. Freeze the meat first (top/bottom round is a great cut) to firm it up for easier slicing.

Alternatively, biltong I believe is a fattier version that's more carnivore friendly. Usually just salt, maybe pepper if I recall correctly. Look up some recipes and see for yourself!",
