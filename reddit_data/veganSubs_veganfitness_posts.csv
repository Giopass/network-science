veganfitness,"Went from 350 pounds to 194 where I am now.

I was very heavy my entire life and decided that when my son was born, I'd need to change my ways for his benefit, and the benefit of my loving family. Becoming vegan was the hardest decision of my life but the one that brought me the best results I could have ever imagined. 

I went from a 62 waist to a 32 where I am now and I've really gotten heavy duty into powerlifting and body sculpting in general.

My health changed CONSIDERABLY once I was not stuck eating animal products, the weight melted off, my body just became incredibly optimal in so many ways. To me, this is my way of life, as it should be, I'm so thankful to plants!!! 😁",Journey from 350 to 194 ,t2_5opq1sjsd,0.98,2601,1735599962.0,1735599962.0,126,Moobygriller,1hq08ma

Today I have ZERO issues with my asthma and I was able to quickly come off all those medications. My endurance and strength is better than ever, and I have even fell in love with competitive bodybuilding as an outlet to advocate for vegans.

veganfitness,"First 100 was in September, second one was last weekend. My time was 31:35, which is not as fast as I wanted but I started the race at 20 hours of sleep deprivation and finished at over 50, so I’m just glad I finished. Physically, I handled it well, as I was running 6 minute miles at mile 95 of the race. The only real problem I had was sleep deprivation, which came with involuntarily falling asleep while moving, as well as intense audio/visual hallucinations. I’m an experienced psychonaut and I’ve never experienced anything as surreal as that, hallucination-wise. 

I trained lifting alongside running pretty heavily for part of the training block for this race, 4x in the week upper/lower split. Then I dropped to 2x per week as the race got closer. My strength fluctuated by I maintained at least 3/4/5 plate bench/squat/deadlift the whole time.

My feedback from the judges: don’t touch anything-just a tiny bit more upper glute. 

I spent the last two years balancing my hormones (thyroid and estrogen), healing SIBO, and building my glute medius. I’m currently pretty far from stage weight (150), so I’m focusing on coming down sustainably to about 165 before hitting the gas. 

My coach really wants me to compete for my pro card summer of 2025, so that is the plan for now.😊

I’m currently not tracking macros. I just eat intuitively. I am getting 12k steps daily, and training 4-5 days a week. My main protein sources are Fava bean tofu, seitan, Meati cutlets, Plant Boss, and Vedge protein powder. My only supplements besides basic vitamins right now are electrolytes during my training, l-glutamine and aloe Vera on an empty stomach for gut health, turmeric+ by Vedge nutrition for cortisol management, and I just added 5mg of Yohimbine this morning for fat loss.

veganfitness,"Hi all! I frrequently comment in this sub so I wanted to share more about me!
I'm a 23 year old with Autism. On the left I was under 120 lbs at 5'11"" when I was 18 years old. Autism caused me to develop a lot of sensory issues when I was younger, and one of those was food aversion as I hated eating. Starvation was also a way for me to distract myself from my sensory issues throughout middle and high school. I also used physical activity, especially lots of walking, running and jittering, as another means of releasing stress and dealing with my sensory issues. Both of these habits combined led to me becoming extremely malnourished.

I discovered both veganism and fitness at the end of my senior year, and they both re-invigorated a sense of purpose and direction within my life. Veganism made me fall in love with cooking and eating, which helped me actually eat enough. It also gave me a vision through its ethical principles. I was even able to get an ethics minor in veganism at my university! Fitness also helped me overcome my sensory issues as it helped me develop self-confidence through bettering myself over time through hard training.

5 years later, I'm sitting around 141 lbs around the same height. I'm still dealing with all of my bad eating habits from my malnourished self, which led to me developing a really bad eating disorder 2 years ago, but I'm happy about my progress!

For the past 2 years, my training has been predominately calisthenics (bodybuilding and skills focused) and running. Let me know if you have any questions!

I've been preaching the same vegan message for 11+ years now and I definitely ain't slowing down. You'd be surprised at the amount of ignorant comments I get when I make a post like this. For whatever reason vegan muscle is very triggering to a lot of people online. Perhaps it's because it questions everything they've been conditioned to believe via society and bro science. Rather than meeting the subject of veganism with an open mind it tends to be met with ignorance/hostility, more so online with keyboard warriors⌨️⚔️
