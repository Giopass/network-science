EatCheapAndVegan,"This is nothing like the seitan you find in stores, it looks and tastes almost exactly like a chicken breast, and like tofu it will pick up pretty much any other flavor you add to it. This has become a staple for me, I make a double or triple batch on weekends and it keeps well in the fridge. Best of all, it has a full DV of B12 in one piece!

Credit to Edgy Veg for the base recipe here: https://www.theedgyveg.com/2014/01/20/vegan-buffalo-wings-recipe/ I make a few modifications, and my quantities are for a double batch of ""breast"" size pieces.

**Ingredients**
* 2 cups Vital Wheat Gluten
* 1 teaspoon salt
* 4 tablespoons nutritional yeast
* 4 tablespoons tahini
* 1.5 cups of water
* optional: 2 tablespoons tamari (can sub broth, soy sauce, coconut aminos, or just skip it)

**Instructions**
1. Mix the dry ingredients (VWG, nutritional yeast, salt). The Edgy Veg recipe adds poultry seasoning and onion powder, I skip these to have a more bland final product.
2. Combine tahini in 1.5 cups of water. It helps if the water is warm but cold is fine too.
3. Add the tahini in water mixture to the dry ingredients and stir gently.
4. Once the water is added to the VWG, it will start pulling together into a sticky mass as in pic 3. Knead very gently a few times, just enough to incorporate all the VWG. Knead more for tougher seitan, knead less for softer seitan. Divide the mass into approximately 12 pieces. Take each piece and fold gently a few times until it has a smoothish outer layer.
5. Once each piece is shaped, lay them all into a deep baking dish and cover with water--all pieces should be fully submerged for baking. This takes the place of boiling or simmering in other seitan recipes.
6. Add 1 to 2 tablespoons of tamari, soy sauce, or coconut aminos to make it soy free. This adds a savoriness to the final seitan pieces but you can skip it if you plan to cook it with other sauces.
7. Bake at 350 F for one hour! After an hour, drain off the water and save it to use as homemade broth, and let the seitan pieces cool for a few minutes. You can then use as a chicken replacement in another recipe, or cover and store in the fridge for up to a week.

**Lemon Pepper Marinade**
* zest of one lemon
* juice of two lemons (about a half cup)
* one clove of garlic, minced
* 1/4 cup oil of your choice
* 1/4 cup water
* pinch of salt
* one tablespoon black pepper (this is a lot of peppery flavor, I LOVE black pepper but feel free to use less, or more!)

Combine all ingredients and pour over the seitan pieces. Cover and refrigerate for at least 2 hours, or overnight.

When you're ready to cook the seitan, heat up another tablespoon or two oil over medium heat, and stir fry about 8 to 10 minutes on each side until lightly browned. Serve and enjoy!

This recipe is fantastic for batch cooking, and is endlessly customizable for your preferences. Add seasoning to the dry ingredients, or add a bit more tahini for a more succulent ""breast"" just bake it a little longer to fully cook through, maybe an extra 10 to 15 minutes. You can add barbecue sauce, buffalo sauce, teriyaki, etc. I'm not exaggerating when I say this seitan can take the place of chicken breast in literally any recipe. I've been using it in a lot of recipes my family made before I went vegan and it holds up.

The last slide is nutrition info from Chronometer based on the proportions given above. 135 kcal per piece, and a full DV of B12!

EatCheapAndVegan,"Kind of a loaded request.  Half of the appeal of using cheese on my sandwiches is that the only thing I have to do is slice it, and sometimes I don't even have to do that.  I don't like spending more time making food than eating it.  There just aren't enough minutes in a day.

The closest thing I can imagine to something that is theoretically about as quick to apply as cheese, and is palatable, would be avocado.  Several problems with that option, though: 1) You don't just buy avocado and then immediately begin eating it‚Äîyou more or less have to work your schedule around the avocado's.  2) Expensive as hell, even compared to cheese.  3) I have really, _really_ bad luck with avocadoes and typically end up discarding half of an entire fruit because it's damaged/rotten, adding to the expense issue.  4) The process of extracting usable avocado from rotten avocado ends up taking a hell of a long time.  5) It begins to brown the moment it's exposed to air, so peeling a new fruit instigates a race against time.  Since browned avocado is oxidant-loaded (and tastes very bad), I avoid.

Maybe there's a good solution out there, but I lack the imagination for it.  I tried hummus a while back.  At least with a hand processor, it takes way too long to make, and is a royal mess to clean up.

EatCheapAndVegan,"This is a super cheap, quick and filling meal! I always have a bag of potatoes hanging out in my cupboard, so this is a meal I make when I have nothing else planned and want a fast dinner. Kind of like a healthier version of fast food.

Any kind of potato will do, if you want red and starchy or yellow wax potatoes, both are delicious! Boil a pot of water, around 6 quarts if you're making dinner for 2, more if you're serving more people. Roughly chop about 1 lb of potatoes with skin on, no need to peel, and toss into boiling water. Boil for around 15 minutes and test with a fork for doneness. The fork should pass all the way through a potato chunk with no resistance. Once they're cooked through, drain off the cooking water.

To the drained potatoes, add about a half cup of unsweetened plant milk, half cup of nutritional yeast, about 1/4 cup of white vinegar, and salt and pepper to taste. If you have a seasoned vinegar that's even better. Mash with a potato masher, or a large wooden spoon to your desired consistency. Let cool for a few minutes, then serve with tortillas and taco toppings--shredded lettuce, sauteed peppers, jalapenos, onions, mushrooms, rice, etc. Beans are a great addition, but potatoes are an underrated source of protein with 15g per cup!

This is highly customizable to your preferences of course! I tend to leave larger chunks of potatoes but smooth is great too. Add a clove of garlic when mashing the potatoes, or roasted garlic. The vinegar is not really optional though, this is the ingredient that takes potatoes from a side dish to main meal material.",t2_rdvc5bo,Mashed Potato Tacos,0.87,290,1729463604.0,1729463604.0,56,cheapandbrittle,1g8azy2

EatCheapAndVegan,"Hello everyone! 

Long time lurker on this sub... 

Im trying to up my protein intake, I'm physically disabled so cooking is really hard for me, but I can't afford to buy a lot of prepackaged foods... 

I've fallen into really bad eating habits, I basically eat whatever's easiest/most accessible in my fridge or pantry at the moment... 

I'm a couponer/do rebates/reviewsfor free food - so I do get some very random food I will probably never buy again, since most are healthy prepackaged foods, but expensive... I do eat those, especially if no cooking is involved... 

So mostly I want to create a daily meal plan for myself, I normally eat very small meals, sometimes just one food at a time, like a snack (banana, apple, popcorn, etc)

I usually eat oatmeal (instant) every day 

But otherwise that's as far as I got meal plan wise, I'd like to eat sort of same food every day, like first meal oatmeal, lots of nutritious snacks, last meal a big salad with lots of veg...

EatCheapAndVegan,"Caveats to avoid:

* **It's not** ***mostly*** **complex carbs**. Complex carbs are a key and neglected part of a good diet. If most of the food's *calories* are coming from toppings/add-ons/seasonings that are *not* complex-carbs, then it's not what I'm looking for.
* **It doesn't have a good density of fiber, vitamins, or nutrients**. The green vegetables (that keep getting recommended) also contain fiber, as well as other important nutrients.
* **It's not calorie-dense enough to be a staple food**. It seems like we should get around 25-50% of our calories from the kind of complex-carb fruit/veggie foods I'm asking about here. If a giant bag of lettuce only has 200 calories (on the high end!), an average adult would need 2.5-5 of those bags. And the taste gets old after half a bag.
* **Requires chef-level inventory management to get nutrients**. If I have to keep 10 or 20 kinds of vegetables in my kitchen (and wash and dice and prepare them), I'm gonna end up taking some vitamins and getting my calories from the wrong food. (This is part of why I'm still obese despite being vegan.)
* **It tastes bad**. The bitter taste of leafy-green vegetables, by itself, is probably at least 30% of the cause of obesity. If you need other things to mask the taste, those things tend to be fatty/non-complex-carb-based (see above). It doesn't need to be snack-food-level optimized, but it shouldn't suck all the flavor out of my ~~soul~~ mouth, like e.g. unseasoned celery.
   * **Requires lots of cooking to taste good**. Cooking often destroys and/or removes the most helpful nutrients in plant foods.

&#x200B;

Things that *don't* fit the criteria:

* **Salads**. Salads generally contain some leafy green base... along with the majority of calories coming from other toppings:
   * Oily/fatty seasonings. We're looking for a complex-carb staple food, and ""half your calories from salads (but 60% of salad calories from fatty seasonings)"" fails at this.
   * Cheese and ranch. Same problem as the oily seasonings.
   * Nuts: Nuts are fatty, so it's not mostly complex carbs.
   * Fruits: As far as I can tell, most fruits seem to only contain like 1-2 nutrients each. This runs headfirst into the ""chef-level inventory management"" caveat above.
* **Lettuce on its own**. A ""classic"" salad-base like iceberg lettuce is nowhere near calorie-dense enough to make up half of an adult's calorie intake. Denser/more-nutritious leafy greens generally taste bad. As with salads, the taste is only masked by seasoning (which tends not to be complex-carbs), or by excessive cooking (which removes the nutrients).
* **Roasted mixed vegetables**. A better variety of nutrients, but still nutrient-lite in proportion to how cooked it is. Also not calorie-dense.
* **Potatoes**. Potatoes are mostly complex carbs, but they're light on fiber and ""green vegetable"" nutrients.
* **Brown rice**. Not very nutrient-dense. Generally placed in a different nutritional category from ""fruits and vegetables"", which is exactly the category I'm asking about.

So... does any food exist that is interesting-tasting, calorie-dense, nutrient-dense, plant-based, and almost-entirely-complex-carbs?

EatCheapAndVegan,"Inspired by a thread from r/MealPrepSunday let's make it vegan! Prepping is one of the best ways to save both money and time. What are your favorite foods or meals to prep for the workweek? Whether you work the typical Monday through Friday hours, or specific to your work situation.

I always prep at least a week's worth of overnight oats for breakfast and change it up each week. Basic recipe is a half cup of rolled oats, one cup of unsweetened almond milk, half cup of cooked quinoa, sometimes a scoop of protein powder, a tablespoon of chia or hemp seeds, and a halfish cup of chopped nuts and fruit (dates and walnuts, almonds and blueberries, almonds and peaches, etc.) Occasionally I'll add something like poppyseeds and grated lemon peel and a little maple syrup.

Since I'm making quinoa for breakfast, I double it and portion out a half cup of quinoa for lunch and add baked tempeh and a veggie. Pretty simple and repetitive but it's cheap and easy.

EatCheapAndVegan,"Hi all! New here, already so impressed by some of the beautiful recipes. 

Quick question - I moved from the UK to USA a few years ago, Aldi is very different here and a new one recently opened near me which I've visited twice now - what do you usually pick up from there? 

I'm in central Florida which might make a difference - Publix, Sprouts and Aldi are within a 10 min drive, Freshfield Farms (unsure if a chain or local business) and Target are 15 mins away, Trader Joes and Whole Foods are 30 mins away. I'm reasonably budget-conscious and try to cook all my food at home from scratch or semi-prepped (eg. Trader Joes frozen dishes), maybe going out for dinner once a week at a local vegan-friendly place. 

The produce quality at my local Aldi seemed pretty disappointing, Freshfield has a better selection and quality with similar prices. Their almond milk has flavourings, sugars and additives which I prefer to avoid, trying to break my expensive Elmhurst habit but their milk is essential for creamy sauces and at-home lattes for me. I didn't see any other vegan dairy alternatives at all. So far I've tried their dried prunes (good, cheaper than Publix) & fresh pickle spears (good, also cheaper than Publix). 

Any recommendations on what to pick up next time much appreciated, thank you! ",t2_12ph5s,What's on your Aldi USA shopping list?,0.81,10,1721767004.0,1721767004.0,16,bunbunbunbunbun_,1eaidl0

EatCheapAndVegan,"Hi everyone! I have a slightly puzzling (and, unfortunately, somewhat embarrassing) problem to solve and I‚Äôm hoping someone here may have some answers. 

Does anyone else get horrible gas/stomach pains from eating TVP? Is there a way to solve this, aside from taking Beano? 

I‚Äôm puzzled as to why I have this issue in the first place, seeing as how I can eat both tofu and whole shelled edamame just fine without trouble. I also eat a consistently high fiber diet and don‚Äôt have this issue when eating other foods that trigger bloat and gas in others (various beans, cruciferous veggies, etc.)

I know some people like to add baking soda to dried beans when they soak them overnight and that seems to help with bloating‚Ä¶ is there a similar application I‚Äôm missing here? I considered trying to add some baking soda to my next batch to see what happens, but considering the nature of TVP I can‚Äôt imagine the baking soda flavor would ever go away or be rinsed off.

Three cloves garlic
Vegan soy sauce
Thyme, oregano, smoked paprika, and chipotle powder. (Alternately use Cajun seasoning and add cayenne until heavily spicy)

Cook until onions are soft and then taste for spices. Go heavy on the spice as this is meant to be served over rice with tofu.

I love cooking and trying new foods, and I'm excited and honored to help mod a sub I have been a member of since I first joined Reddit almost seven years ago!

I'm going to be posting a lot more about tips and tricks that I've learned over the years being vegan on a budget, including meal planning, sourcing and preserving foods. We know that plant-based diets are the cheapest diets around, Oxford University even said so! For real though, being vegan is so easy and affordable, and it benefits you, the animals, and the planet. If you're a long time vegan, I would love to hear some of your tips that you've learned over the years! If you're new to veganism or just vegan-curious, please share your tips as well and ask any questions you have, I guarantee we've all asked the same questions at some point. I love a good Beyond burger from time to time, but you don't need meat replacements to be vegan and I want to foster more discussion here on how cheap and easy veganism really is.

I also want to hear feedback from all of you! What do you love about this sub and what keeps bringing you back? Also, what do you not love about this sub? What kind of content would you like to see more often? I'm not including a poll because I do'n't want to limit the options, so please drop a comment with your thoughts. Or if you just want to say hi that's cool too. All of your feedback will help improve this sub for everyone.

EatCheapAndVegan,"One thing I‚Äôve craved since going vegan is a luxurious creamy pasta sauce and I‚Äôve finally found a worthy substitute. The basic formula is 1 cup of coconut milk to 3 oz of hummus which will be enough for around 15 oz of dry pasta. I used vegetables that needed using, but you could add anything you feel is suitable. 

My combination:

Roasted 15 oz of cherry tomatoes with some garlic.

Cooked pasta, drained, then added coconut milk, hummus, a couple of handfuls of baby spinach and 2 oz of vegan Parmesan then stirred it through. 

Combined the pasta and sauce with the cherry tomatoes, topped with some some more vegan Parmesan and put back in the oven for 10 minutes.

It was so creamy and the hummus added a nice complexity. I highly recommend.

EatCheapAndVegan,"Hi all. 5‚Äô8‚Äù 135lbs 27M.

I‚Äôd like to hit 165lbs by year-end. Exercise (lifting and running) is easy and fun for me, as is rest+recovery.

Eating is incredibly difficult, a chore, and probably my least favorite thing to do. 

But I clearly have to because that‚Äôs always been the biggest limitation for me.

Couple that with the fact that I take a medication that suppresses my appetite and I barely have time to eat/cook as a med student.

With that in mind - suggestions on how to approach this? I paid attention to what a seemingly ‚Äúbig day of eating‚Äù looked like for me, and I hit like 2300 calories‚Ä¶.im aiming for **2800** every day and ~135g/protein.

I have access to costco via a borrowed Instacart app, Publix, and if absolutely necessary, TJ‚Äôs and Walmart.

At home I have a huge sack of brown rice, quinoa, oats. I have Dave‚Äôs bread. Peanut butter. Vegan protein powder.

How should I go about this? Ideally I hack caloric density because volume of food and time spent eating is probably going to be a point of failure for me

I should add - I‚Äôm not strictly vegan (some dairy-lifelong vegetarian). I consume Greek yogurt and other things in passing though I prefer not to. But I try to eat extremely clean and always have - I don‚Äôt eat junk food, drink soda/juice, etc. Also if possible I‚Äôd like to avoid fake meat but I‚Äôll go crazy on tofu and beans and whatever else.",t2_1hkmvpjd,"I‚Äôd like to gain 30lbs this year.

EatCheapAndVegan,"I was craving soba noodles tonight, and luckily I had a few things on hand to do a lazy version of takeout. Soba noodles are decently high in protein and cheap, my grocery store has triple packs for $3. This recipe uses 1 bundle of noodles, so this meal cost around $6 total, and I got rid of the poor lone radish hanging out in my fridge.

* First boil the soba noodles according to the package directions, about 8 minutes. While the noodles were boiling, I minced some garlic cloves, ginger, and a radish.

* Next I drained the noodles, then in the same pot I heated a tablespoon of sesame oil over medium heat and sauteed the garlic, ginger and radish for about a minute. On top of that, I added about half a block of firm tofu torn into chunks and half a cup of frozen edamame. Stir together with the garlic mixture, then add ~3 tablespoons soy sauce. Cook for about 5 minutes, just enough to heat the tofu.

* Last, add thinly sliced collard greens (or any firm greens, kale or boy choy would work too) on top of the tofu. Add about a half cup of water to the pot and it will steam the greens almost instantly. Let simmer together for another 5 minutes.

I need your opinions... What food is worth buying vs making from scratch?  Examples....

Beans=cook your own from dried beans

Bread=make your own, especially if you have a bread machine

Almond and Oat= make your own

Soy Milk=?

Yogurt=?

Tahini=?  I have made it and bought it.  Seems cheaper and waaaay easier to buy.

Vegan mayo?  I'm not sure on this one

Vegan ""cheese""=make your own saucy cheeses; I'm still experimenting with sliceable/shreddable cheeses.

Extracts (vanilla, orange, etc.)= buy

Tomato sauces= ? Most seem pretty easy to make

Seitan=looks easy to make.  Haven't actually tried yet

Recipe:

Ingredients:

  - 1 small onion, finely chopped
  - 2 green chillies, finely chopped
  - 3 tbsp fresh coriander, chopped
  - 1 tsp cumin powder
  - 1 tsp coriander powder
  - 1/2 tsp turmeric powder
  - Salt, to taste
  - 4 tbsp chickpea flour (besan)
  - 4 tbsp breadcrumbs
  - Oil, for frying

- For the mango sauce:
  - ¬æ cup mango pieces
  - ¬º cup vegan mayonnaise
  - 3 tbsp vegan mustard
  - ¬Ω tsp chilli flakes
  - 1 tbsp fresh lemon juice

  - 4 slices vegan cheddar cheese (Optional)
  - 1 cup rocket (arugula)
  - 1 tomato, sliced
  - 1/2 red onion, sliced
  - 4 burger buns
  - 1 tbsp vegan mayonnaise

Method:

1. In a large bowl, combine the mashed potatoes, finely chopped onion, green chillies, fresh coriander, cumin powder, coriander powder, turmeric powder, and salt. Mix well until all ingredients are evenly incorporated.

2. Add the chickpea flour and breadcrumbs to the potato mixture, mixing until a firm dough forms. Shape into 4 equal patties.

3. Heat oil in a pan over medium heat. Fry the potato patties for about 4-5 minutes on each side, or until golden brown and crispy. Remove from the pan and set aside.

7. Serve the burgers immediately, accompanied by your favourite sides like sweet potato fries or a fresh salad.

EatCheapAndVegan,"I'd love some ideas for cheap and easy vegan snacks that don't take a lot of prep time. They don't have to be on-the-spot prep but I have only the weekends to cook (unless it's super fast) so something I could almost prepare easily on a weekend and have for several days at least, even a week or more (if it can be frozen).

My schedule is a bit strange, as I teach students from Europe online and I am also running my own business separately, so my day begins super early (I wake up at 4 a.m.). I can't eat a full meal that early so I grab some homemade soynuts and tea very early (like 5 a.m.) and then because of my teaching schedule, I don't eat again (oatmeal) until around 11 a.m. The early morning soynuts are great during days I teach since I'm too busy to feel hungry with students back-to-back, but the weekends are different, as I'm working on my business and tend to get peckish at around 8-ish. That's why I'm looking for something super quick and cheap.

Some of the obvious choices (like nuts and fruit) are just too expensive for my budget right now (fruit in my area is insanely expensive - and before you say it, cheaper options like farmer's markets, Costco, etc., are not available, as I live in a very small town and don't own/drive a car so I'm limited in mobility).

**Ingredients**

* ¬æ¬†cup¬†cooked black bleans
* 1¬†cup¬†TVP (textured vegetable protein)
* ¬æ¬†cup¬†hot water
* 2¬†Tablespoons¬†soy sauce
* 1¬†Tablespoon¬†apple cider vinegar
* 3¬†Tablespoons¬†nutritional yeast
* 2¬†Tablespoons¬†smooth almond butter¬†(or 1 ¬Ω tablespoon oil for nut-free)
* 1¬†Tablespoon¬†Italian seasoning blend
* 1¬†teaspoon¬†garlic powder

* ¬Ω¬†teaspoon¬†smoked paprika
* ¬º¬†teaspoon¬†fennel powder
* black pepper to taste
* ¬æ¬†cup¬†vital wheat gluten (cannot be substituted)

**Instructions**

1. Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (176 C)

2. In a mixing bowl, fully mash the beans with a fork so there are no large pieces. Add the TVP, hot water, soy sauce, and vinegar. Stir well and let sit for 5 minutes to hydrate the TVP.

3. To the bowl, add the nutritional yeast, almond butter, Italian herbs, garlic powder, onion powder, paprika, fennel seed, and black pepper. Mix well.

4. Add the vital wheat gluten. Knead the mixture in the bowl for about 30 seconds to develop the gluten.

5. Pinch off small chunks of the dough and roll between your palms to form a ball. You should end up with 22 to 24 meatballs. It's important not to make the meatballs any larger than this or they won't cook uniformly. Place on the baking sheet.

6. Bake for 13 minutes, then carefully flip the meatballs. Bake for another 15 to 17 minutes or until crisp and dry on the outside and piping hot in the center.",t2_rdvc5bo,"Vegan Meatballs! Black beans, TVP and seitan for a meaty texture",0.99,99,1734716661.0,1734716661.0,6,cheapandbrittle,1hip9jj

EatCheapAndVegan,"This is based on Andrew Bernard's recipe from Make it Dairy Free, blog post here: https://makeitdairyfree.com/one-bowl-vegan-pumpkin-baked-oatmeal/ and Youtube video here: https://youtu.be/M8vYwax2ybk?si=NAIJnFyGVL2ADIQI

Instead of pumpkin, I used an acorn squash that I baked and mashed myself. Pumpkin is great, but acorn squash brings a really unique creamy flavor without the sweetness of pumpkin. This version is probably not sweet enough to fit into the ""dessert"" category but it's delicious as a breakfast meal or any time snack.

To bake your own acorn squash, simply preheat your oven to 350F. Cut your acorn squash in half and scoop out the seeds (you can roast these too if you want, or put them outside for critters). Put the squash halves on a baking sheet, preferably with raised edges because it will get juicy, and bake at 350 for around 30 to 40 minutes. They're done when a knife goes all the way through with no resistance. Let the squash halves cool, about another half hour, until cool enough to handle. Then the skin should peel off easily. Put the halves into a bowl and squish with your hands until smooth. You can use a blender here, I find my hands work just as well and I don't need to get the blender dirty.

This recipe will use about half of a medium sized acorn squash. For the remaining half, either refrigerate in an airtight container for up to a week or freeze it. Use the acorn squash mash anywhere you would use pumpkin! To make the baked oatmeal:

**Ingredients**
* 2 cups¬†dairy free milk of your choice
* 1 and 3/4 cup mashed acorn squash
* 1/2 cup¬†maple syrup
* 1¬†teaspoon¬†vanilla

* 2 1/2 cups¬†rolled oats (or oat flour or a combination)
* 1 tablespoon¬†arrowroot starch (original recipe uses ground flax seed)
* 1¬†teaspoon¬†baking powder
* 1 teaspoon salt
* 1 teaspoon cinnamon
* 1/2 teaspoon each ground nutmeg and cloves, or other seasonal spices of your choice
* Optional: add a half cup of raisins, walnuts, pecans, pumpkin seeds, etc. I threw a handful of pumpkin seeds on top for maximum autumn aesthetic.

**Instructions**
Mix the wet ingredients first, until the squash and plant milk is fully incorporated. Add the dry ingredients right on top of the wet ingredients and stir until combined. Pour into a greased 9x13 pan and bake at 350F for about 40 minutes. Let cool and enjoy!",t2_rdvc5bo,Acorn Squash Baked Oatmeal,0.99,95,1729778215.0,1729778215.0,6,cheapandbrittle,1gb38bs

EatCheapAndVegan,"Very budget friendly. I don‚Äôt know what kind of vegan ‚Äútuna‚Äù you have, but in Mexico we have Soyamigo (last picture), which has a variety of vegan soy-based ‚Äúmeats‚Äù that are cheap and tasty once prepared.

In Spanish these are called ‚ÄúCroquetas de At√∫n‚Äù.

I fry carrots (3-4) and onion with the vegan tuna, while 4 large potatoes are boiling with salt. 

Once everything is ready we just mash the potatoes, add the vegan tuna little by little, and, as a personal preference I add like a cup of garbanzo meal with breadcrumbs.l for the texture. You make small cakes/balls with the minute, and pass each one on more breadcrumbs. If you can, I add some seaweed in the mix for a bit of ‚Äúsea‚Äù flavor, but that‚Äôs not necessary, the flavor is still great. 

For seasoning I normally just use salt, black pepper, cayenne pepper, and garlic or garlic salt. 

The original/traditional recipe calls for the cakes to be fried, but I made mine on an oven to be a bit healthy. 

The veggies plus the vegan tuna mix made me 20 well sized cakes. I ate 4 at a time, as they are filling, so these lasted for 5 days. I recommend eating with rice, and a salad with lettuce (I didn‚Äôt have any), tomato or something just as fresh, and LOTS of lemon/lime.

I soaked them overnight in water with some baking soda.  Baking soda usually makes legumes cook more quickly and reduces the FODMAPS ( fart sugars ) in them.

EatCheapAndVegan,"Craving a hearty, delicious breakfast? This tofu scramble is the ultimate plant-based alternative to scrambled eggs! Perfect for a vegan breakfast, it‚Äôs packed with protein and easy to make.

I used firm tofu but you can also use a softer or silken kind if you like a softer and creamier texture.

Here is the recipe :

Ingredients:

\- 2 tbsp olive oil or cooking oil of your choice

\- 1 block (14‚Äì16 oz) firm tofu

\- 2 tbsp nutritional yeast

\- ¬º tsp salt (adjust to taste)

\- ¬º tsp turmeric powder

\- ¬Ω tsp garlic powder

\- Freshly ground black pepper (to taste)

\- ¬Ω tsp onion powder

\- ¬Ω tsp paprika

\- ¬Ω tsp chili flakes (optional, for a mild version skip this)

\- ¬Ω tsp black salt (Indian kala namak)

\- ¬Ω cup (120 mL) oat milk (or any plant-based milk)

\- 1 bunch of chives, chopped

Instructions:

Prepare the Tofu:

\- Drain the tofu using a tofu press or create a makeshift press using cutting boards.

\- To press the tofu without a press:

1. Place a clean dish towel or paper towels on a flat cutting board.
2. Set the tofu on top, cover it with another towel, and place a second cutting board over it.
3. Weigh it down with a heavy object like a skillet, canned goods, or a cookbook.

Make the Sauce before sauteeing tofu

\- Whisk together the oat milk, turmeric, garlic powder, onion powder, paprika, chili flakes, kala namak, black pepper, and nutritional yeast in a bowl.

\- Stir until smooth and fully combined.

\- After pressing, crumble the tofu into medium-sized chunks resembling scrambled eggs.

Heat a large nonstick skillet over medium-high heat and add the oil.

\- Once the oil is hot, add the crumbled tofu and cook for 5‚Äì7 minutes, stirring occasionally, until lightly browned.

\- Avoid constant stirring to allow some pieces to develop a crispy texture.

\- Pour the sauce over the tofu and gently fold with a spatula to coat evenly.

\- Cook for a few more minutes, stirring occasionally, until the scramble reaches your desired consistency.

\- Taste and adjust salt as needed.

\- Garnish with freshly chopped chives.

I don't have a picture of my own right now, but I feel like I have to share this salad since I've been eating it once a day for the past month. It's really easy to meal prep. I just make the dressing and throw all the veg together and heat up leftover rice/chickpeas when I want it. 

I just buy pre-shredded coleslaw mix since it's all they really have where I get my groceries, but one 12-oz bag lasts me all week.

EatCheapAndVegan,"A few things I‚Äôve picked up to better season meals. These may be no brainers to many, but I took this knowledge for granted for many years. 

1. Aromatics. Not really a dried seasoning but I add garlic/some kind of onion/ (maybe ginger) to 90% of my meals. A bulb of garlic and a yellow or white onion a week easily- just for aromatics. Garlic is extremely good for blood pressure and I‚Äôll usually double the garlic in a recipe. Also great for cancer prevention. 

2. I cheat with packets. I buy seasoning packets at the store and use the ingredient list on the back when searching for different flavor profiles. For example, traditional taco seasoning is mostly flour and paprika and garlic salt (thanks Taco Bell seasoning packet). Then I season to taste. (Salt and pepper at virtually all stages of cooking.)

Using the packets has saved me from buying a lot of unneeded bottles of spices/seasoning. 

3. I almost always add lemon or lime juice. Usually lemon for lighter things and lime for bolder things. The acid will elevate the taste. 

Legumes are the main staple of my diet and following the above I‚Äôve been able to eat very cheaply and deliciously. ",t2_85p8x,3 Tricks to seasoning,0.83,19,1717603285.0,1717603285.0,4,harav,1d8tiso

The sauce is made of canned roasted tomatoes, red curry paste, garlic, onions, and ginger.

I made the soy labneh from dried soybeans that I made into milk, then cultured it with water kefir, then strained it, and added onion and garlic powder to it before topping it over your curry. I love it because it tastes like sour cream and is probiotic.
Dried soybeans are super cheap- and making your own cheese and milk from it is a great way to save money. It was $35 for a 25lbs sack of organic soybeans! Which is an absolute ton! 

The sourdough loaf was hydrated with the leftover whey from when I made the labneh. This made the loaf extra tangy and delicious.

Creamy courgette cannellini beans with tofu chorizo  
Recipe:

1 onion - 9p  
3 garlic cloves - 10p  
1 small bunch of parsley - 60p  
2 cans butter beans (480g butter beans, 250ml of the bean water ) - 98p  
2 medium courgettes - ¬£1  
1 tsp white miso - 8p  
1 tbsp nutritional yeast - 30p  
1 Lemon - 24p  
800g small potatoes - 80p  
10g oregano - 10p

Tofu chorizo  
450 g extra-firm tofu - ¬£2.50  
3 tsp smoked sweet paprika - 45p  
1/2 tsp ground cumin - 13p  
30 ml soy sauce - 12p  
1 tbsp red wine vinegar - 8p  
2 tsp maple syrup - 16p  
15g tomato puree - 8p  
10g onion powder - 10p

Total Cost: ¬£7:91  
4 Portions

Method:

For the beans:

* Slice one courgette in half then slice into thin half moons. (about ¬Ω cm thick)
* Peel the second courgette to create ribbons, with the leftover center of the courgette dice it into cubes. Thinly slice the onion and garlic. Finely chop the parsley (keeping the stalks separate from the leaves).
* Heat up 1 tbsp of olive oil in a heavy based wide pan over a medium-high heat. Add half of the courgettes and fry until golden on both sides. Remove the courgette from the pan.
* Add in 1 tbsp olive oil and the onion, garlic, parsley stalks and courgette cubes. Fry until lightly golden.
* Add in one third of the butter beans and mash with a potato masher or fork. Then add the rest with the butter beans plus the water.
* Add zest and juice of one lemon, nutritional yeast and miso. Bring to a simmer and leave for 15 minutes with a lid slightly on top slightly ajar.
* Once the sauce has thickened add in the courgettes we fried earlier plus the chopped parsley leaves.
* Dress the courgette ribbons with a touch of lemon juice and olive oil.
* Season and serve the creamy courgette and white beans.

For the tofu chorizo:

* In a jug / small bowl mix whisk together the paprika, cumin, soy sauce, red wine vinegar, maple syrup, tomato puree, onion powder, olive oil.
* Dry the tofu with a tea towel or kitchen roll then crumble into a large bowl (roughly 1cm pieces). Pour over the spice mix and massage into the tofu.
* Heat up 1 tbsp oil in a medium fryer pan over a medium-high heat.
* Once hot add the tofu mix in a thin layer and fry for 3-4 minutes or until golden and crispy. (You don‚Äôt want the pan too crowded or the tofu will steam so you may need to cook it in batches)
* Flip the tofu crumbled over and fry for another 3-4 minutes until nice and crispy.
* Pour onto the kitchen roll to drain off any excess fat.
* Serve the smoky crumbled tofu on top of the creamy courgette beans.

For the potatoes:

* Cut them into equal size pieces. (about 1 inch cubed)
* Season with salt, pepper, oregano and 1 tbsp of olive oil.
* Roast in the airfryer at 180C for 25-30 minutes or until crispy on the outside and soft inside.",t2_9gux7klo,Budget-Friendly Creamy White Beans with Vegan Chorizo,0.96,20,1720245760.0,1720245760.0,3,Geojam97,1dwiueu

EatCheapAndVegan,"Hey all! This is my first post here, even though I've been lurking for a while. I wanted to share my French toast recipe since I recently was gifted way too much French bread. 


Ingredients: 

1-2 cups (depending on how much bread you use) plant milk, cold. I've tried this with both soy and oat. 

For every 1c liquid, 2 tbsp corn starch. 

Bread, sliced

A small amount of oil to cost the bottom of a pan


How: 

Mix the corn starch into the cold plant milk u til dissolved, place in a shallow dish. 

Dip both sides of the bread in the dish, and place on a medium high heat. 

Fry about 3-4 min each side, or until golden brown. 


That's it! Serve with your preferred topping. I don't recommend adding sugars to the starch mix, as you'll run the risk of burning.

EatCheapAndVegan,"Hey Eat Cheap and Vegan community! Looking for a delicious plant-based sausage recipe that‚Äôs free from gluten, seitan, and TVP? I've got you covered. These are full of flavour, have a lovely texture and are mostly wholefood. You can makes these cheaper by using white button mushrooms, using peanuts instead of walnuts and not using any maple syrup. You also don't have to use the rice paper as it's just to emulate the skin you get on non-vegan sausages. I've just posted a video on youtube sharing my recipe but you can also find the full written recipe below. I'd recommend watching the video to see in detail how they're made. Thanks! üíö

Vegan sausages

Makes 10 sausages

Complete mise en place (preparations) in the ingredients list before starting the method.

Ingredients

For the sausages:

3 onions, finely sliced : 30p  
2 tbsp fresh rosemary, thyme and parsley, finely chopped or 3 tbsp of dried herbs : 10p  
1 small apple or pear : 10p  
300g chestnut mushrooms, roughly chopped : ¬£1  
1 tsp maple syrup: 15p  
20g walnuts : 20p  
80g oats : 10p  
100g cannellini beans, drained and rinsed : 18p  
1 tbsp tomato puree : 5p  
1 tbsp soy sauce or tamari : 5p  
1 tsp dijon mustard : 8p  
1 pinch ground nutmeg : 4p  
1 tbsp dried oregano : 8p  
280g extra firm tofu : ¬£1.30  
30g ground almonds : 14p  
5 pieces of rice paper / spring roll paper, cut in half : 60p

For the sausage glaze:

1 tsp marmite : 10p  
2 tsp miso : 20p  
2 tsp maple syrup: 30p  
1 tbsp olive oil : 18p  
30ml hot water

Method:

* Blend the mushrooms in a food processor until finely chopped. Don‚Äôt wash the food processor after use.
* Heat a medium frying pan over a high heat with 1 tbsp of oil. Fry the mushrooms until all the water has evaporated out of them. Remove into a large bowl.
* In the same pan fry the sliced onions on a medium-high heat. Turn every 2-3 minutes and cook until golden brown and soft. Half way through cooking add the maple syrup to help with caramelisation. Add to the large bowl.
* In the food processor blend the walnuts and oats until a rough sand texture is achieved.
* Add the cannellini beans, tomato puree, soy sauce, herbs, dijon mustard and nutmeg.
* Blend until a rough paste is achieved.
* Add the paste to the large bowl. Crumble in the extra firm tofu and add the ground almonds.
* Mix until everything is well combined. Taste and season. Refrigerate for 20-30 minutes.
* Meanwhile make the glaze by whisking together the miso, maple syrup, olive oil and hot water.
* Remove the sausage mix from the fridge and divide into 10 portions. Roughly a ‚Öì cup / 80ml each.
* Shape each portion into a sausage shape and place on baking paper or an oiled baking tray. Glaze the sausages using a pastry brush.
* Into a bowl of warm water, submerge the rice paper for 3-4 seconds, shake off excess water and place on a chopping board or kitchen surface.
* Place a sausage and one end of the rice paper and roll the rice paper around the sausage as tightly as possible. Almost like you were rolling a burrito.
* Repeat with all the sausages and place on a baking tray. Do not let them touch each other as they will stick.
* Heat a frying pan over a medium heat with a tsp of oil and fry the sausages for 2-3 minutes on each side. You can also turn the sausages on their ends to brown them.
* I haven‚Äôt tried cooking them in the oven or airfryer. I expect 200C in the oven for around 15 minutes and 180C in the airfryer for around 10 minutes should work.
* Remove from the pan and enjoy!

I make these regularly- they‚Äôre inexpensive and use mostly pantry ingredients. They‚Äôre a perfect grab and go breakfast item. They‚Äôre not very sweet - more like a granola bar. Hope you enjoy!

(Adapted from Kathryn Taylor‚Äôs recipe in Love Real Food)

* 1 cup quick-cooking oats
* 1 cup all purpose or whole wheat flour 
* 1 tsp. baking powder
* 1 tsp. ground cinnamon
* ¬Ω tsp. salt
* 3 tbsp chia seeds
* 1 ripe banana
* ¬º tsp. ground ginger
* 1 ¬Ω cups peeled grated carrots (about ¬Ω pound)
* 1 cup roughly chopped raw pecans 
* ¬º cup chopped dates
* ¬Ω cup maple syrup
* ¬Ω cup melted coconut oil


1. Preheat the oven to 375¬∞F. Line a large rimmed baking sheet with parchment paper.
2. In a large bowl, combine the oats, flour, baking powder, cinnamon, salt, chia seeds and ginger. Whisk to blend. Add the carrots, nuts, and dates and stir to combine. Add a mashed banana to this mixture and stir again. 
3. In a medium bowl, combine the maple syrup and coconut oil. Whisk until blended. Pour the liquid mixture into the dry mixture and stir just until combined. The dough might be rather wet, but don‚Äôt worry.
4. Drop ¬º-cup scoops of dough (an ice cream scoop with a wire scraper is perfect for this) onto the prepared baking sheet, leaving several inches of space around each one. Use the palm of your hand to gently flatten each cookie to about ¬æ inch thick
5. Bake until the cookies are golden and firm around the edges, 15 to 17 minutes. Cool the cookies on the baking sheet on a cooling rack for 10 minutes, then carefully transfer the cookies to the rack to cool completely (otherwise, the bottoms can brown too much.

EatCheapAndVegan,"Hey Eat Cheap and Vegan community! I've posted a recipe for a comforting paella featuring crispy tofu and roasted fennel. This delicious and satisfying dish comes in at under ¬£2/$2.60 per portion, making it perfect for those who want a hearty meal without breaking the bank. You can  find the full written recipe below. I'd recommend watching the video to see in detail how they're made. Thanks! üíö

[Video Recipe](https://youtu.be/Iwp0OPkO2bE)



  
Vegan Paella with crispy herbed tofu and roasted fennel   
  
Complete mise en place (preparations) in the ingredients list before starting the method.  
  
Ingredients   
  
For the Paella:  
  
1 onion, diced : 12p  
1 tbsp olive oil : 12p  
1 bay leaf : 4p  
1 tbsp fresh rosemary, finely chopped : 5p  
200g white beans : 24p  
¬Ω a  green pepper, diced : 22p  
¬Ω a red pepper, diced : 22p  
3 cloves garlic, finely chopped : 12p  
1 can chopped tomatoes : 39p  
1 tsp sweet paprika : 5p  
‚Öì  tsp turmeric : 5p  
1 tsp sumac : 10p  
1 tbsp capers, chopped : 20p (optional)   
50ml white wine : 43p (optional) (You could also use 1 tbsp white wine vinegar)   
300g paella rice (If using risotto rice, rinse with water first) : ¬£2  
25g parsley, finely chopped (Stalks separated and finely chopped) : 20p  
100g frozen peas : 10p   
600ml vegetable stock - 10p (500ml if using risotto rice but check what the packaging of your rice advises) (I would add less water to start and if you think it needs it during cooking you can add more. Whereas if you add too much it‚Äôs hard to take it way)  
1 bulb fresh fennel, cut into 2 cm thick wedges (Tougher parts finely chopped to go into paella) - 85p  
1 lemon, 25p  
  
For the tofu:  
  
1 block firm tofu (The tofu thats comes in water not the pre-pressed one that comes vac packed) : ¬£1.40  
1 tbsp olive oil : 12p  
1 tbsp soy sauce : 8p  
¬Ω  tbsp salt  
1 1/2 tbsp arrowroot : 12p  
2 tbsp chicken herb seasoning : 20p (Or a any mix of dried herbs and spices)  
  
  
Method  
  
For the Paella:  
  
- Heat up 1 tbsp oil in a large, wide skillet (or paella pan) over a medium heat. Add the onion, tougher part of fennel, peppers and bay leaf. Cook for 8-10 minutes until caramelised.  
- Add the parsley stalks and rosemary.  
- Add the spices and cook for 1 minute stirring continuously.  
- Add the white wine to deglaze the pan followed by the chopped tomatoes and half the parsley.   
- Add in the hot vegetable stock followed by the paella rice and stir until everything is well distributed. Bring to a boil then do not stir the pan at all for the rest of the cooking.  
- Turn the heat down to medium and simmer for 5 minutes.  
- Then turn the heat down to low and simmer gently for 15 minutes. Shaking the pan occasionally to prevent the rice from sticking. Add the frozen peas.  
- Cook for another 3-5 minutes until all the water is absorbed and the rice is al dente (still has a slight bite to it).   
- Turn off the heat and cover with a tea towel. Leave to rest for 5-10 minutes before enjoying it.  
  
For the tofu and fennel:   
  
- Preheat the oven 220C.  
- Drain the tofu and slice into 1 ¬Ω cm thick triangles.  
- In a container whisk together 750ml boiling water with the salt and soy sauce.  
- Soak the tofu in the brine for 15 minutes. (Do not soak for longer or it will be too salty.  
- Thoroughly dry the tofu, being careful not to break it.  
In a large bowl coat the tofu in olive oil.   
- Combine the arrowroot and chicken season and coat the tofu with it.  
- On a baking tray lined with baking parchment lay out the tofu on one side, leaving a small gap between each piece.   
- Then coat the fennel with olive oil and spread on the other side of the tray. Place in the preheated oven.  
- The fennel will take 15-20 minutes, it should be soft and caramelised.  
- The tofu will take 25-30 minutes, it should be crispy on the outside but still slightly moist inside.  
- Turn both half way through to ensure even cooking.  
  
  
Cost Overall : ¬£7.87 / $10:35  
Cost per portion: ¬£1.96 / $2.58  
  
You can reduce the cost of the recipe by:  
  
- Not using white wine. Replace with 1 tbsp white wine vinegar or don‚Äôt use at all.  
- Using just 1 pepper instead of 2.  
- Using dried instead of fresh herbs.  
- Using 1 tbsp tomato puree instead of chopped tomatoes.  
- Use onion powder instead of fresh onion.  
- Use frozen chopped peppers instead of fresh.  
- Using cheaper oil or cooking without oil.  
- Use frozen peppers",t2_9gux7klo,Budget-Friendly Vegan Paella with Crispy Tofu | Under ¬£2/$2.60 Per Portion,1.0,5,1726246850.0,1726246850.0,2,Geojam97,1ffzqvi

EatCheapAndVegan,"I‚Äôm working on a special project for my best friend‚Äôs birthday, and I could use your help! She‚Äôs gluten- and lactose-intolerant, and the idea is to make a personalized cookbook that‚Äôs practical, full of recipes, snacks, and tips she can actually enjoy without worrying about her intolerances.

She loves food but doesn‚Äôt always have the time or energy to cook, so I want this book to be a mix of easy, affordable ideas and some fun, indulgent meals. Since she doesn‚Äôt stick to a gluten- or lactose-free diet perfectly, I‚Äôm including cheat sections, too, with clear notes on what might cause issues.

Handwritten in a nice, organized notebook, she's lived with it for a long while, but I figured it would be a nice gift and a nice way to mix up her normal routine. I am not to educated in this sorta thing so any info if it a tip, an idea, or a full recipe, please feel free to reply or pm me.

# The Plan

# 1. Cover Page & Introduction

This will include:

* A letter to her explaining the gift.
* A table of contents listing all the sections.

# 2. Cheat Sheet Section

Helpful facts and tips to make life easier:

* Gluten- and lactose-free alternatives for common ingredients.
* Foods people think are gluten- or lactose-free but aren‚Äôt‚Äîand surprising ones that are
* A list of shelf-stable and easy-to-find store-bought options in Canada she ca stock up and have on hand

# 3. Snacks & Quick Meals

A section of gluten- and lactose-free snack ideas and quick meals she can whip up when time is short. I‚Äôll also include late-night lazy options, cozy/comfort, movie night, hangover cures, and good lunches. The focus here is on time.

# 4. Gluten- & Lactose-Free Dinners

Nice filling dinner recipes that range from quick and easy to more elaborate meals for when she‚Äôs feeling motivated. That she can rely on for herself and when cooking for others, I've heard gluten free stuff doesn‚Äôt taste near as good but I'm sure some people have some go to favorites.

# 5. Gluten Cheat Section

Sometimes you eat the gluten and deal with it later. These recipes will be lactose-free but not gluten-free, organized by estimated prep time and ‚Äúseverity‚Äù (how much gluten is in it, on a rough 1‚Äì5 scale). Snacks, lunches, dinner.

# 6. Lactose Cheat Section

For when skipping lactose isn‚Äôt a priority. These recipes will be gluten-free but not lactose-free, also organized by prep time and severity. Snacks, lunch, dinner.

# 7. Desserts/Baking

A mix of gluten- and lactose-free desserts, plus cheat options for when she wants something indulgent. Baking isn‚Äôt a huge focus for her, so this section will be smaller but still have a few fun ideas. Also, might throw some cocktails or something here, maybe recommended for some meals.

# The Recipe Format

Each recipe will include:

* Title
* Quick Info:
   * Gluten-free/lactose-free status.
   * Estimated prep time and total time.
   * For cheat recipes, a 1‚Äì5 severity scale for gluten or lactose content.
* Ingredients List: Ingredients will be listed clearly, with the ingredient followed by its amount for easy reading. Example:
   * Baking soda: 1 tbsp
   * Gluten-free flour: 2 cups
   * Sugar: 3 tbsp
* Instructions: Simple step-by-step directions.
* Photo Placeholder: I‚Äôll leave a spot to print and paste a picture of the dish.

# What I need help with

I‚Äôm planning to do plenty of research myself and compile everything over the winter break and start to write it would in the following months, but I‚Äôd love suggestions from anyone who‚Äôs gluten- or lactose-intolerant or knows great recipes.

Do you have:

* Easy, filling recipes or meal ideas (snacks, dinners, desserts, etc.)?
* Tips for shopping or meal prep?
* Favorite gluten- or lactose-free brands or products available in Canada?
* Anything helpful or info on your mind
* Ideas of info I should subtly get out of her to make the book better

Please reply or reach out and I'd love to hear it, nothing is too small. I'm probably going to use a nice notebook that‚Äôs a size B6 or an A4 with 80 pages so I got a lot of space to fill out, I will leave a few pages in each section for her to fill out if she has some go to meals she wants to include in it too. I'll probably check back here in a while with an update

# TL;DR

I‚Äôm making a personalized gluten- and lactose-free cookbook for my friend‚Äôs birthday. It‚Äôll include recipes, tips, and cheat sections for when she‚Äôs okay with bending the rules. Looking for easy, affordable, and practical meal ideas, snacks, and Canadian store-bought recommendations. Let me know if you have any recipes, tips, or products that could help!

EatCheapAndVegan,"This red kidney bean curry is a delightful, vegan-friendly dish rooted in tradition. Cooked without garlic, onions, or tomatoes, it embraces the simplicity of sattvic cooking, focusing on purity and balance. The recipe combines the hearty goodness of kidney beans with the warm, aromatic flavors of whole spices like cinnamon and cardamom.

Traditionally prepared with yogurt, my version uses plant-based yogurt to maintain its signature creaminess without sacrificing authenticity. Perfect with rice or flatbreads, this wholesome curry is a comforting and flavorful addition to any meal. Eat it as a stew with a nice crusty bead for wholesome dinner that is vegan and high in protein.

Main Ingredients:

1 cup red kidney beans (soaked overnight for 6‚Äì8 hours)

3 cups water (or enough to submerge beans by 2 inches)

¬Ω‚Äì1 cup plant based yogurt , whisked until smooth and creamy

3 tbsp cooking oil

Whole Aromatics:

1 black cardamom

1 tsp cumin seeds

2 small bay leaves

1 cinnamon stick (about 2‚Äì3 inches long)

4 whole cloves

Ground Spices:

¬Ω tsp turmeric powder

1 tsp dried ginger powder

2 tsp fennel powder2 tsp red chili powder or paprika

Instructions

Prep the Kidney Beans:

Rinse the soaked kidney beans thoroughly and set them aside after draining. 

 2. Infuse the Spices:

Turn your Instant Pot to Saut√© mode. Heat the oil. Add cumin seeds, crushed black cardamom, bay leaves, cloves, and the cinnamon stick. Stir for about 30 seconds to let the spices bloom and release their aroma.

3. Build the Base:

Add the drained kidney beans, turmeric powder, ginger powder, fennel powder, red chili powder, and salt. Pour in 3 cups of water, ensuring the beans are fully submerged.

4. Cook Under Pressure:

Seal the lid, set the Instant Pot valve to Seal, and cook on High Pressure for 35 minutes. Allow the pressure to release naturally for maximum flavor.

5. Achieve the Perfect Consistency:

Check the beans for doneness. For a creamy texture, lightly mash some of the beans. Switch back to Saut√© mode to continue cooking.

6. Incorporate Yogurt:

Whisk in the plant based yogurt . Simmer the curry for 5‚Äì7 minutes until it thickens to your liking.

7. Serve and Savor:

EatCheapAndVegan,"I bet this will be the first time many of you are hearing about this unique recipe! This dish hails from the breathtaking Kashmir region of India, where the cuisine of the Kashmiri Pandit community stands out for its distinct approach to flavor. Unlike many other Indian dishes, Kashmiri cuisine often omits onion and garlic, relying instead on yogurt, tamarind, and a blend of fragrant spices to create its signature taste. The result? Dishes that are light, aromatic, and absolutely delicious. I grew up savoring this cuisine in my Kashmiri family and it holds a special place in my heart. I‚Äôm so excited to share this treasured recipe with you all‚Äîan authentic taste of Kashmir that‚Äôs simple yet extraordinary!

This Bottle Gourd Curry, or Al Yakhni, is a beloved dish in Kashmiri cuisine known for its subtle yet aromatic flavors. Traditionally made without onion or garlic, this dish lets the delicate taste of bottle gourd take center stage. The bottle gourd is fried until golden and then simmered gently in a fragrant medley of whole spices, creating a light yet flavorful curry. 

This recipe offers a vegan twist by using creamy plant-based yogurt, such as cashew yogurt, as a substitute for the full-fat dairy yogurt in the traditional version. The result is a rich, silky texture and a delicious taste that stays true to the essence of the original dish. 

  
I highly making this dish if you like your food aromatic but without any heat. This dish is very cooling and best eaten with a big bowl of white steamed rice!

Main Ingredients:  

\- 2 tablespoons olive oil or your preferred cooking oil  

\- 1 pound cashew yogurt (or any plant-based yogurt)  

\- 1 large or 2 small bottle gourds (lauki), peeled and sliced  

Whole Spices:  

\- 4 green cardamom pods, lightly crushed  

\- 2 black cardamom pods  

\- 4 whole cloves  

\- 2 cinnamon sticks  

\- 4 peppercorns  

\- 1 bay leaf  

Ground Spices:  

\- 1 tablespoon fennel powder  

\- 1/2 tablespoon cumin powder  

\- 1/2 tablespoon ginger powder  



Other Seasonings:  

\- A pinch of asafoetida (heeng)  

\- Salt, to taste  



For Garnish:  

\- Dried crushed mint  

Instructions  

1. Prepare the Bottle Gourd:  

Peel the skin of the bottle gourd and cut it into thick round slices. The thickness helps maintain their shape during cooking while absorbing the flavors.  

2. Fry the Bottle Gourd:  

In a deep pan, heat mustard oil or your choice of oil until hot. Add a pinch of salt to the oil to season the gourd and minimize splattering. Fry the slices until golden brown and slightly crispy on the edges. Remove and drain on a paper towel.  

3. Make the Spiced Yogurt Mixture:  

In a mixing bowl, whisk the plant-based yogurt until smooth. Add the ground spices‚Äîfennel powder, cumin powder, and ginger powder‚Äîalong with salt. Blend thoroughly to ensure a lump-free mixture.  

4. Toast the Whole Spices:  

In another pan, heat 5 tablespoons of oil over medium heat. Add the whole spices: green and black cardamom, cloves, cinnamon sticks, bay leaf, and peppercorns. Allow them to sizzle, releasing their aroma. Lightly crush the cardamom and peppercorns to enhance the flavor.  

5. Combine Yogurt and Spices:  

Reduce the heat to low and slowly add the yogurt mixture to the pan with the whole spices, stirring continuously to prevent curdling. Bring it to a gentle boil and let it simmer until it thickens slightly. Add water if the sauce becomes too thick, adjusting to your desired consistency.  6. Add the Fried Bottle Gourd:  

Carefully add the fried bottle gourd slices into the yogurt sauce. Stir gently to coat each piece with the rich, spiced mixture. Allow the curry to simmer for a few more minutes so the flavors meld and the gourd becomes tender.  

7. Garnish and Serve:  

Finish with a sprinkle of dried crushed mint for a fresh and aromatic touch. Serve warm with steamed rice or your favorite flatbreads. Enjoy!

What to eat to keep a high calorie/protein vegan diet? I'm struggling to maintain this.. I'm starting to be at a crossroads and wanting to possibly switch back to meat! Even tho I know that's something I don't want to do again I just don't know what to do, I'm struggling so much with this vegan diet, and cooking all time more than usual, and not knowing what to eat or even how to make different vegan meals! My creativity isn't even all that there for that! It's really taking a toll on me, not being able to spend time or go out with my family like I used to, not having any vegan restaurants near me to go out when I want instead of cooking all the damn time, I try to stay away from processed foods to be more healthier.. but I'm slowly starting to feel myself convert back to that. I just feel lonely and with no one by my side here to help me who is also along this lifestyle/ journey! I've been thinking about this for a long time and it just seems I can't grow from this or become better at it. Any help will help a lot.. thanks.

UPDATE: To all of those who may have seen my posts, or those who have not, I have forgotten to add some things in here! 


‚Ä¢ BEANS!! ‚Ä¢

       - I know beans can help a ton, but since being vegan is a high fiber diet, my stomach really has issues with it. Ever since I became vegan, I have (kinda embarrassingly*), been having bad vegan farts! I have tried beano, but those don‚Äôt work for me! I‚Äôve tried another beano brand and those don‚Äôt work either! I‚Äôm tired of having these bad vegan farts! I want to try to remain having this vegan lifestyle, but I want to find a way to get rid of these horrible farts! I live with my family, and I share a room with my sister, and even she sometimes or *most of the times* can‚Äôt stand my vegan farts! They‚Äôre worse than the usually farts, let‚Äôs say lol. I have to keep it real! Because I do need help on this! Beans really do a number on me! & so does vegan fiber in general, so basically most to all vegan foods! And that is also what is making me question this vegan lifestyle, because the farts are so bad! Has anyone else been through this and/or is going through this? Any help with this would be great as well! Thanks! ",t2_gavtr2zos,High Calorie/Protein Vegan ‚Ä¢UPDATE‚Ä¢ ‚Ä¢BEANS!!‚Ä¢,1.0,1,1721849779.0,1721849779.0,0,AdPositive116,1ebafb1
EatCheapAndVegan,"Leftover black bean burger! Made almost entirely from leftovers in my kitchen. My family all ate one and they're quite good!

1. 1.5 cans of your choice of beans, we had half a can of leftover black beans and I opened a new one. 
2. About 1.5 / 2 cups or rice stale rice puff cereal, unflavored 
3. One whole beef steak tomato with the black parts cut off (it was super old and I forgot about it, still good to eat tho)
4. About 1/4 of an onion that was in the fridge
5. A few squirts of mustard 
6. Salt to taste
7. Pepper to taste
8. Paprika to taste
9. Garlic powder to taste
10. Powdered chili pepper to taste.
11. A handful of flour (optional)

Take your bean of choice and either mash it up or leave it whole. Make sure to drain the beans and rinse them first.  Add your chopped onion, tomato, and the cereal. Give it a good mix with your hands so the cereal turns soggy and everything forms into a paste. Add seasonings and mix again. If the mixture is too soggy add the flour. 

Heat your skillet on medium heat until a drop of water instantly evaporates. Roll burger dough into balls and drop onto skillet. Carefully flatten the patty with your spatula and cook for 4 minutes on each side. These are delicate patties so make sure to oil the skillet as well. 

Enjoy!
