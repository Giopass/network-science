m4mm2b9,t1_m4m0dtq,1hq08ma,"Hell of a transformation, I am sure it was difficult, congratulations!",
m4lzbj2,t1_m4ls518,1hq08ma,"So push pull legs Monday / Weds / Fri and work days and off days were a mix of high incline walking at 4mph for 15 minutes then running at 7.5mph for the other 15 minutes. 

Lifting wise, I do 6 sets per exercise, classic pyramid light to heavy

This morning was pull so I did - 

Cable curls

Cable lat pulldowns

Cable rows

Deadlifts 

T bar rows

Face Pulls

Seated rows

Pull ups

Preacher curls

Concentration curls

Overhead Tri Extensions

Cable shrugs

So volume was around 120,000lbs~ish for the day and I do slight variations to hit slightly different accessory muscle groups that are looking fluffy

I basically went cold turkey into full plant based diet then adapted other pieces of the vegan lifestyle. I started off with something called the portfolio diet because my cholesterol was so high and after a couple months of doing that and bringing my LDL from 300 down to 80, I was on a roll. Nuts, tons and tons and tons and tons of oatmeal and overnight oats (this is predominantly what zapped my cholesterol so quickly), avocados, bean tacos, bean salads, veggie chili, veggie soups, LOTS of homemade fermented foods like kimchi, miso, tofu, natto, sauerkrauts, etc to establish happy belly monsters (I went down this rabbit hole 😂)",😂
m65eptb,t1_m4mnj7v,1hq08ma,"Unfortunately he’s on steroids lol, look at post history.",
m4lzuav,t1_m4ly3oy,1hq08ma,A little over 2 years!,
m4m6o1i,t1_m4m3pm2,1hq08ma,Ohh good call thank you!!,
m4n61r6,t1_m4mx7nb,1hq08ma,The diet certainly helped but I log and logged just about every bite of food religiously. It helped me stay on track and gain insight into how I was eating.,
m4n7yrt,t1_m4n7dhi,1hq08ma,"There's still times where I have junk here and there as it's important to be flexible in food specifically. My base food is mostly raw stuff, as close to the core ingredient as I can go. There was a minute where I was doing something called benecol butter for a couple of months because it was helping reduce my cholesterol, but then I just started making my own butter at home vs spending the $9 a tub on the stuff.",
m51flol,t1_m5191tn,1hq08ma,Yes indeed! I went into depth on this topic on the other post 😅,😅
m4n643u,t1_m4mtjt8,1hq08ma,You got this!!,
m4mml0s,t1_m4lzbj2,1hq08ma,How did that change from the start till now? What was your exercise routine like at the beginning? I’ve done vegan for a couple years of my life. It was definitely the healthiest I’ve ever been.,
m4pp8bs,t1_m4lzbj2,1hq08ma,Hell yes thanks for sharing this. I applaud you for such an amazing accomplishment!,
m4r3vg6,t1_m4lzbj2,1hq08ma,Like how much oatmeal?,
m65hzwr,t1_m65eptb,1hq08ma,Oh… lol. He does seem to be well into the PEDs. Hopefully he hasn’t traded one cause of death for another,
m4p5kqk,t1_m4n61r6,1hq08ma,That’s amazing. What was your calorie count throughout?,
m4n8ycs,t1_m4n7yrt,1hq08ma,"Nice, I’ve slowly begun making improvements but I have so much further I can go in terms of eating better. My biggest issue is that I’m always hungry even after what should be considered a good meal. That may be food addiction more than anything but I need to figure it out.",
m4n6vpz,t1_m4mml0s,1hq08ma,"So in the beginning my exercise was OK because I felt that it was important to ease myself into things vs jumping in and overdoing it. While I became more adept at moving and lifting, I started to do more and more to keep up. 

There were so many points where I had to break plateaus and those were probably the more challenging aspects of this entire process, but they worked really well for me. Things like running more, or running at all 😂",😂
m4r4ex0,t1_m4r3vg6,1hq08ma,"1 cup dry every morning - comes out to a lot 😂

It's about 400 calories per bowl for me. I use sprouted oats from Costco.",😂
m69m6bc,t1_m65hzwr,1hq08ma,"Yup, not sure why this wasn’t mentioned in the original post either.",
m4p5xr9,t1_m4p5kqk,1hq08ma,"2500 per day, for the past four months it's been about 3500 a day cutting slow",
m4n94ku,t1_m4n8ycs,1hq08ma,"For me, part of it was mental and part was physical.",
m4nj58o,t1_m4n6vpz,1hq08ma,Thanks,
m4p6ab2,t1_m4p5xr9,1hq08ma,Im 54. A lifetime of heaviness. A vegan of two years. Lots of motivation from reading this thread.,
m4n9xoj,t1_m4n94ku,1hq08ma,"Yeah, there are definitely meals out there that fill me up specifically a green smoothie that I drink, but I struggle to replicate that with solid foods I think the mental aspect is a huge thing as well for me especially. Boredom, being in my feelings, whatever it is I think at times get the best of me",
m4pao7g,t1_m4p6ab2,1hq08ma,It's never too late mate. You got this!,
m4na4v4,t1_m4n9xoj,1hq08ma,Boredom was it for me! I was also diagnosed with ADHD which really helped my brain get you a healthy place once I was actually medicated for it.,

l3tuy3f,t1_l3nzyes,1cpj682,"I little bit of coincidence. We are avid documentaries nerds, environmental friendly activity lovers, and foodies. The week before marrying, we watched Cowspiracy without knowing what to expect. By the time we finished watching, and our jaws dropping, we looked at each other and said, does this mean we need to ditch meat. (By the way my husband is Argentinian and I lived there for 10 years, so we used to love a good BBQ). 
So, we immediately started changing our wedding menu (it was a very informal 3 days camping wedding in the middle of Mexican natural park, close to our home… as we used to live in Mexico City, at the time). So we replaced the BBQ for tons of homemade falafel, etc). 
Everyone was so pleased with the vegan menu we offered and it was such a success that it reassured us about our decision and never went back. Little by little I started to get in shape and started to enjoy the perks of a plant-based diet ( like not feeling bloated as soon as I finished a meal, feeling light, loosing weight, and opening my foodie spectrum to so many other untried vegetables and the rich Mexican inherently vegan gastronomy). 
We never went back and 4 years later we ditched our corporate job, I took a master in gastronomy and another one in plant-based nutrition and started a vegan food blog with the intention of sharing all the perks of following a plant-based diet and veganizing most to of the recipes that we were missing.",

l3u6q3j,t1_l3loh2u,1cpj682,"Well... I'd say start ditching what is easier to ditch for you. In our case we had a goal: become 100% vegan, but did not want to feel like if we failed with a meal, everything was going to go to hell. So We ditched rd meat and poultry immediately. My hb left Argentinean meat, only for bi Argentinean events, while we lived in Mexico. After a couple of months, he just couldn't eat it anymore. We had eggs or cheese, only in social events when we couldn't or didn't want to be a pain in the a\*\*. Like cake, or things we were unsure about. Then we just naturally found our ways to do it. Our favorite recipes are the ones we have in our food blog (ourplantbasedword.com), we we love curries (Indian and Thai, we found them very quick to make and being crowd-pleasers). All our non-vega friends love them, so everyone is happy. Also, they are great to cook in large quantities, so we always freeze them in portions, to have super yummy meals readily made. We also make lots of types of vegan pesto sauces, to be able to put flavor in our food quickly.

We ray to eat a lot of high protein foods, so we dedicate a portion of the blog to that, as we train 4-6 times per week, so that makes it easier to meet our fitness goals.",

I completely agree, you enjoy your time together until it’s over, but the part where you step out of this life and experience what’s next is a solo mission.
The process of death is way more bearable to do with the one(s) you love by your side. The shared experience of those last days make it a lot “easier” for the ones left behind, so it’s a win-win.
Sudden death is never easy, unfair and harsh.. especially at a young age.
I hope you’ll get that song and dance when you get there, but don’t forget to enjoy the time you have here! Take care!!",

Breakfast - whole oat groats with fresh fruit and walnuts

Protein smoothie (on workout days) - frozen fruit, soy milk, protein blend

Lunch - meal prep, quinoa with baked tofu and vegetables

Snack - yogurt with granola

Dinner - Tacos, soyrizo, black beans, lettuce, avocado, salsa

Beverage - 1 hop water or NA beer, lots of water throughout the day 

Dessert - occasional dark chocolate bar 

Supplements - creatine (5-10mg), B12, cycle multivitamin, sometimes cycle additional things like vit D or iron

There's quite a bit of variation from above but that's pretty typical and my other days probably have similar total nutrients and calories. I'm sorry I'm not very diligent about  tracking so don't have total numbers for you.

lv4qgky,t1_lv4pels,1gid0ji,Haha well it happened 🤣,🤣
lvrhg4t,t1_lvp5614,1gid0ji,I get more than that. but I find it easy based on the foods I like. You can eat seitan,

lv69thq,t1_lv5mkf9,1gid0ji,"You’re wrong. It also looks more dramatic because OPs posture improved and the poses are different.

But OP worked super hard and smart and was consistent. Did the right exercises and kept increasing weights and ate really well (to support muscle growth). And is young. 

None of that is at all negative, I am a huge fan of OP just from this post! You can search for other vegan transformations and find them. It doesn’t have to be peds. Why make your life worse with peds, when you can just improve it with what OP did?",

The way they built muscle is believable to me given the existing muscle mass/leanness they started off with in the whole context of training, diet (shared - 100% believable) and height.

lv7v44e,t1_lv7r05l,1gid0ji,"It was my first 6 months as a beginner. The first month was only at home workouts with Caroline Girvan videos. And even within the 6 months there was trial and error, but the thing that stayed consistent was that I trained all my muscles til failure 3 times a week the entire time. But yes, I was a competitive gymnast for 3 years in my youth and very familiar with body positioning. I think it helped me pick up form quickly. Also as a child I had done 3 months of crossfit so it was easier to build on deadlift and squat form from what I remembered.  I utilized r/formcheck but they said my form was already decent. Needing minor tweaks

I also did jump right into the ""perfect diet"" because I had already done trial and error and a lot of researching a bunch of different methods. On reddit I finally found out ""1g protein per lb of Bodyweight"" and eating at maintenance to attempt body recomp. Or slight surplus for lean bulking. I did try to eat at maintenance for the first couple months but failed due to being so hungry from lifting, and ended up eating in surplus. This was a happy accident resulting in ideal muscle building. I also looked into ideal exercises and rep ranges for hypertrophy, isolation exercises, compounds, etc. I make a conscious decision to continue deadlifting even though it isn't great for hypertrophy, for example.

I got all my information from reddit which is honestly awesome. Like I didn't know what compound, isolation, hypertrophy, training til failure, progressive overload, etc. All meant. I found all that on reddit. I really love this site so much. I looked at r/strongcurves,  r/petitefitness, r/xxfitness and tried to look at the people with best results and tried to understand what they were saying by watching tons of videos 

It honestly has just really hurt my feelings when people say I'm lying especially since what motivated me to begin with was other peoples progress pics on reddit. I get that when you post on the internet you have to be open to that. But its so frustrating when sharing something positive.

Even if your receptivity is low you will still put on crazy mass. Will they necessarily be pro card level? No, not necessarily. Will they be well beyond the natural limits of the vast majority, or even near totality of natural lifters? Absolutely.

Really curious what your dog in this fight is. Why are you arguing that we shouldn't hold people accountable for misleading people about their PED usage?

m3unxnn,t1_m3sj5xz,1hkr4ln,"Unfortunately, steroids are incredibly easy to get. Almost all popular gyms will have a few people who know how to get some, and I don't believe it's overly expensive depending on what you for.

There is a difference between a strong responder and a weaker one, that's well established, but to say that the difference in growth potential between an enhanced athlete and a non-enhanced one isn't absolutely dramatic is bs. It's well established science. A dude with average genetics can absolutely get an elite level physic with steroids. Saying otherwise is pure cope.

As for unrealistic expectations, pure size isn't even the only issue. The perception of being able to maintain mass at low body fat percentages is another issue that arises from lying about steroid use. Pretty much no natural athlete can sustain that for prolonged periods, but juice sure makes it a lot easier.",

Not to mention the 0 studies on polypharmacy.

If by elite level you mean even just a pro card this is absolutely not the case, otherwise literally everybody would be able to take a couple grams and get one (spoiler plenty try that, and fail) I don't know how many times I can repeat the same thing, when you aren't immersed in bbing at all, you'll have the exact gen pop understanding of this that I'm arguing against. 

Shape, structure, and aesthetics are all completely genetically determined and will get you the most attention on social media. These people can be completely natural, and have completely unattainable physiques. 

Again, natty or not isn't relevant to if someone is giving false hope or not to their audience.",
m3qkm6m,t1_m3q0vm3,1hkr4ln,"By an elite physique I'm talking about natural body builders, not something like the IFBB. I get what you're saying from a proportion standpoint point. Will taking steroids make your muscle bellies longer? No. Will they make your bone structure better? No. Same goes for fiber composition, size of specific muscles relative to one another, and muscle insertions. Will they make your muscles proportionally bigger the more you take? Yes, absolutely. More anabolic compounds will cause more growth. That isn't a question from a scientific basis. If you weigh 210 on some dosage, and then you increase that dosage, you WILL gain mass. That isn't in question. Most people when they see a guy in a shirt with massive shoulders and big arms aren't going to be critiquing that persons physique from the perspective of an actual pro bodybuilder or a judge, or even an enthusiast. They just see a guy who is way too lean at 210 hitting crazy weight for reps with crazy vasculature, and THAT is the unrealistic image.",

I eat pretty much the same thing every day .. 

200g tofu /80-100g tempeh, 200g veggies , 200g fruits , 2scoops vegan protein powder (~60g protein), ~55g beans/lentils, 60g soy(a) granules/chunks, of course 50-100g rice /tortillas/quinoa equivalent 

Pretty much the same items with different flavors cooked in different forms/dishes 

I did measure calories at least approximately for the most part and would meal prep, staying mostly around 1800-2000cal through the year,  but reducing it to 1.5k at the lowest only for a very short period. Took me longer but find it sustainable.

For the workouts, I did weight lifting for the first half of the year, but found myself lacking a lot in cardio fitness and endurance so joined CrossFit like mid year and would do CrossFit 3 days per week, but I not only feel lighter but also am truly fitter with my Vo2 max etc.,",

m3gld4e,t1_m3c53e2,1hk6vu4,"Hi 62 male here 6' tall and been on a similar journey as you for almost 6 months now.

I started due to cardiovascular issues (blood clot in leg).  My heart is fine but it was discovered that I have plaque throughout my cardiovascular system.

Doc wanted me on a statin to lower my cholesterol but I chose a lifestyle complete overhaul.

I eat similar but I focus on zero added oil in foods.   My only fats are from flaxseed chia seed and limited nuts also soy milk and tofu have a fair amount.

Also I was following the cardiovascular diets Drs Caldwell Esselstein and Dean Ornish.

Both focus on high carb low fat but no not advocate for protein that would be typical of anyone doing and bodybuilding.

As a result I have been getting closer to 70 grams of protein.  

I started at 212 and am currently 183.

I literally just got my BMI into normal range and don't plan to lose much more as at my age it's harder to regain muscle.

All that said I do intend to try to continue losing fat.  My main glad is metabolic health to help my cardiovascular health.

I don't believe it's realistic to achieve your very impressive body comp at my age but I want to get closer.

I have possibly lower protein needs as I have not been able to work legs, biggest muscles we have.  Hopefully in Spring I can begin my leg days

As a result I used an app and deselected lower body.  I have a set of dumbbells and a bench and have been doing upper body and core all this time.

Everyone that knows me has told me that I look more fit now than they have ever seen me.  That said I still can pinch more than an inch

My blood pressure is the lowest it's has been in my entire 62 years (63 in 2 weeks) and my LDL cholesterol had gone from 132 to 78 after 2 months on the diet.  Can't wait to see my numbers in January.

May I ask what your fat and carb macros are?

I am considering upping my protein when I can include legs in my weight training 

Anyway long post thanks, it's inspiring to see this kind of transformation",

lxy8z1j,t3_1gv0v80,1gv0v80,"I figured I'd go over a bit of my routine and what I do to answer questions. I've been vegan about 5 years now is the first thing second, I'm 5'8.

Workout - I follow an asynchronous split that's 9 days total

Day 1 - Pull+Incline treadmill

Day 2 - Push+Stairmaster

Day 3 - Rest+Jog

Day 4 - Legs+Incline treadmill

Day 5 - Pull+Stairmaster

Day 6 - Rest+Jog)

Day 7 - Push+Incline treadmill

Day 8 - Forearms/Grip+Stairmaster

Day 9 - Rest+Jog

Nutrition - I eat pretty simple. A lot of frozen vegetables, fruits, beans, lentins, rice, pb&j's and noodles/pata. I add a protein shake into every meal as I'm 95% certain I have some sort of mild intolerance or allergy to soy as in the large quantities I'd like I find my body starts feelings not well over a longer period of time.

Macros - My protein comes out to between 150-200grams a day averaging between 180grams. Calorie wise, I'm somewhere between 3000-4k with most days about 3500. I'm able to get my calories that high and lose the weight I have because my workload is intense with each of the lifting sessions being about an hour while cardio is thirty minutes. I don't count macros nor calories and mainly base how much I eat that day based off of how I'm feeling.

Side note - I've had a physique similar to this before (meaning similar muscle mass and body fat percentage) which is a big reason why I could make a transformation like this.

Any other questions, feel free to ask!",
lxz2rmt,t3_1gv0v80,1gv0v80,"There is a scene in the Simpsons where Homer tries to put together a BBQ pit from a kit and fails miserably because he only had the instructions in French. You know it isn't going to go well when he starts off with ""LeGrille, What the hell is that!?"". He holds up the picture on the box with what it is supposed to look like and compares it to the reality of the catastrophic mess he made and exclaims ""WHY DOESN'T MINE LOOK LIKE THAT!?""

The running joke between me and my girlfriend is that when we see progress pics that far in away exceeding our own experience and wonder ""why don't we look like that"",  we send it to each other with the caption ""LeGrille!"". Your post was sent to me with LeGrille status.

I've looked like what I do right now before. I'd say where I'm at currently is probably where I ""peaked"" at previously but I'm older a lot smarter now. And it'd be disingenuous to not mention that I have had a physique like this previously. That's a huge factor honestly. I just had an about two year hiatus from working out leading up to the first photo due to a relationship I was in not being so great. 

But the main things I've found that helped me was really just being a lot kinder to myself in this process. There were days where my push day was just bench press, shoulder press, some core and then leaving. Or my usually thirty minutes of cardio was 15. And that's really helped me keep progressing rather than having to take steps back.

And thank you!",

Just an example of one of my usual meals is a ~cup of oats, ~two ounces of cashew and the dried cranberry’s and that’ll come out to probably like 20 grams of protein.

Like people always say abs are made in the kitchen etc but if I just lose weight doesn't seem anything changes. I don't work out but it would be at home stuff/bodyweight if I did.

Arms kinda skinny, legs look fine tbh (used to be fat so had to carry more weight? Plus bike and walk everywhere), everything is just at my stomach and it's annoying and has been so forever.",

ly0e1zp,t1_ly03t3z,1gv0v80,"Intensity is a weird one, if you feel your muscles are recovered like the day before working them again that’s a perfect spot to be. For example my legs being only once every 9 days they don’t feel 100% until right before I work them again",
ly3e45g,t1_ly03t3z,1gv0v80,"You can lose weight quickly but adding muscle takes a lot of time especially if youre a bit older in life and never had muscle mass when younger. 

Protein is a huge factor. A little while back I did a carnivore diet(not trying to get into a debate on that, just giving you my experience) which naturally increased my protein by a lot and i definitely put on muscle quicker/easier. I assumed that by having protein shakes etc, i was hitting my protein but i wasnt hitting the target. Point here is definitely track your protein intake and make sure youre getting the 2g per kg of body weight - at least until you’ve gained more experience on the topic.

The eay you train also plays a big role, though this is a huge, lengthy topic and too much to type on my phone haha. Id def suggest resistance training and i suppose hypertrophy training if youre trying to get bigger. 

How old are you?",
ly0uk0f,t1_ly0n6ai,1gv0v80,I'm in a caloric deficit so more protein has been shown to be beneficial and I'm also under 1g/lbofbw,

I train 4x/week. Usually one deadlift, two squat, and three bench sessions plus whatever accessories. (I might be adding another bench session if my elbows can handle it 🤞)

I track macros most of the time, but I'm pretty flexible with it in the off-season. Generally I aim for 150+g of protein daily and anywhere in the 350-400g of carbs daily. I'm pretty active outside of training, so I'm usually in the neighborhood of 3000 calories daily.

For reference I'm 5'7 and generally train at just over 69kg. I just eat less fibre the week before competing to make weight.",🤞

Maybe it's due to lower inflammation. Meat-eating swole bodies never look particularly healthy and meat-eating hypertrophic bodies look hard but not as... I dunno *nice* as vegan muscles? I feel like they look good because our bodies actually *like* building muscle this way.",😯😃

I don’t do any bodyweight movements. I only utilize weighted movements so I can continue to grow and challenge myself.

Shred it for sushi filling, shred and air fry for a crunchy salad topper, silken tofu in sauces, soft tofu drizzled with sauce and topped with scallions, sliced thinly and pan fried for sandwiches, highly spiced pan fried and wrapped in seaweed snack, breaded with panko for teriyaki or orange tofu, boiled and added into a chickpea salad as an egg white sub, double freeze then air fry to dry out, marinate and roast. I could keep going Forrest Gump style for hours hahaha

m743c6q,t1_m73thpi,1i15kg9,"Keep in mind she is not 100% natty (no shade,  Brooke, but I know you’ve said it before). If you are natty of course your results will slightly differ",
m73pbzs,t1_m73ftyd,1i15kg9,That’s hard to answer because I change my deficit based off my progression. I start slow and every time I plateau I either decrease food or increase energy expenditure.,
m75et3b,t1_m7405rr,1i15kg9,It comes unflavored. It’s a lot like TVP,
m777opi,t1_m7754at,1i15kg9,"See I just feel like my life would be infinitely easier if I could love tofu specifically like that, I'm a bit envious of your passion for tofu to be perfectly honest! I have been meaning to experiment with silken tofu in sauces because I really feel it might be an easy way we can get boost the protein in our meals without turning off my partner, so thanks for reminding me to do this! 

So my username is because I have Reynaud's Syndrome, and generally don't manage my own body temperature super well, but particularly in my extremities. So unless my shower is hot enough to steam up the room enough that evaporative cooling can no longer occur, whatever part of me that isn't directly under the water is miserably cold. So my showers are super hot and I preheat the bathroom with a space heater before I will get in. 

Anyway I've been told by many people this is not their experience with showers lol.",
maxd7fr,t1_max3cfp,1i15kg9,Aw thanks so much!! I feel like the shreds are the most versatile. They’re really good in soups and made like taco meat in the skillet. I like the nuggets too but you can’t do quite as much with them other than roll them in buffalo or BBQ sauce.,
m73pjlg,t1_m73pbzs,1i15kg9,Glad to see you’re actually educated on cico. Keep up the good work!,
m77t24d,t1_m75et3b,1i15kg9,"Fair point, texture?",
m778k4y,t1_m777opi,1i15kg9,"So interesting, thanks for telling me! It's always interesting to me to learn reasons others take super hot showers too. It's more common than I ever imagined. I also have major issues regulating body temp due to bipolar disorder and major weight loss. I actually moved out of the country for awhile because of it. Now I'm back near Seattle and have to use heated vests and gloves in the winter or I'd get frost bite in 40 degree weather. Ok, that's a slight exaggeration, but not much. I'm only comfortable if it's above 65 degrees.",

It absolutely destroyed my apatite so I've been rapidly losing weight ever since I started it. Which is fine, I could stand to do a cut anyway.

lw3h63d,t1_lw2vf1v,1gmim0k,A Peanut butter sandwich with a bag of edamame will get you most of your day’s protein if you aren’t trying to build muscle.

May I ask age? Height? Current weight?",
lw6nlyd,t1_lw2vf1v,1gmim0k,"Yes, protein is very very important. It’s the building block for a lot of stuff in the human body. 

The body heals quicker and gets sick less frequently with adequate protein. It also helps hair and nails. 

The stuff is great at maintaining physique. If you’re dieting, even if you’re not working out, protein will work to keep your muscle from breaking down to be used as body fuel. 

The muscle synthesis is great too. Even if you don’t work out, it just feels like your muscles obey what your mind wants them to do. I know that sounds extreme but from someone who was deficient for several years it sucked not being able to feel or exert as much strength as I knew I was capable of. 

I have a nasty habit of eating one meal a day, and I was probably getting about 40-50 grams of protein a day for over 3 years. I’m a 200lb 5’11” man and it wasn’t really enough for me. I upped my daily intake to 120g minimum (aiming for 150g normally) a few months ago and my general quality of life has improved a lot. I use powders and bars though, it’s tough for me to eat enough Whole Foods to reach that goal.",

l6m10xl,t1_l6lz18l,1d4wvix,"Depends on your activity level and weight. The general rule for people who hit the gym and want to put on muscle is 1.6g of protein per kg of body weight. But because vegans have to assemble protein from amino acids in plants it’s a bit less efficient (animal protein is just ready to go because we are animals too). So for vegans it’s better to take like 2.1g per kg. You also really have to pay attention to the amino acids in the protein you take. Just taking in rice protein for example isn’t going to do much because it’s not a complete protein in and of itself. 80% chick pea protein and 20% rice protein is perfect, but there are other combinations you can make. Again, it’s a bit more complicated to get right but the most important thing is that we CAN get it right and the body is amazing at storing amino acids for later use, so the combinations can have time in between them. It’s an amazing thing",

l6m5jra,t1_l6m10xl,1d4wvix,"I’ve just started working out. So I’m like 35, 5ft tall and 40kg (I’m 18-19%) body fat, i know reading my weight would read alarm bells to people… but I’m just petite, my frame is super tiny so even at this weight I’m not skinny at all. 

I just want to build up on my glutes. A year back cause of work load and stress I ended up going from 45kg to 40. At 45kg I had couple of back rolls which are now gone, but with that weight loss I ended up losing some butt mass as well… so now that my body fat is good, I want to really work my glutes and arms back to a good shape and definition. For that I need protein I know, it’s just hard to get it in for me cause of my acid influx and whey issues and protein powder taste issues, but I’m gonna really give this a shot best I can cause I don’t want to be working out and not see results because of diet and I know how important getting a minimum of protein is, plus calorie surplus to grow altogether. 
Thanks so much for the help :)",

Also some mornings rather than the first shake mentioned above I'll have protein overnight oats or a tofu scramble with avocado toast or something along those lines..

The last group still seen the most growth even with an absurd # of sets. Which is something I thought would be bs if I heard someone say it a few months ago. With PED’s, in those sets, you would in theory have better quality recovery in between sessions,& in turn, better quality sets  which would give you a small edge.

m8m86zw,t1_m8k235y,1i7ef6d,"I love this stuff and your comment bummed me out a bit so I asked chatGPT.

His reply below, slightly summarized:

Fava bean tofu is made by extracting and coagulating the proteins from fava beans while leaving behind most of the carbs. The process is similar to soy based tofu 

1. Protein extraction: the fava beans are soaked, ground, and strained to extract their protein rich liquid. This removes much of the starch and fiber

2. Coagulation: a coagulant is added to solidly the tofu

3. Draining & Pressing: the resulting curds are pressed, further removing and liquid that might contain residual carbs

Since the carbs are filtered out, the final product ends up being nearly pure protein and very low in carbs- some times close to zero, depending on the process.

He went on to say:

it’s legit. The process is real and scientifically sound. It works because the carbs in fava beans are mostly starches and fibers which can be removed during protein extraction

Most people don't realize that a significant percentage of organic farmers use shrimp meal instead of chemical fertilizer. Add to this that bone char, carbonized animal bones, is used in the production of refined, brown, and confectioners sugar as well as water filtration and organic fertilizer blends. It is nearly impossible to be vegan unless you grow all your own food.

Think about it. If you aren't at home, there is a chance that even your water wouldn't be vegan... It's those pesky water filters.",

lxv7ned,t1_lxunvo9,1gufdm6,"Okay then.. here you go.

Today, 5 years ago, my life completely fell apart and began putting itself back together.

I had a psychotic break. Fell and bashed my head. At the hospital they told me I 
had a concussion, pneumonia, encephalitis and I was HIV+.  Having encephalitis and being positive means I have HIV Associated Neurocognative Disorder. Fun trip. I spent the following month in the ICU. Of which I remember almost zero. I missed Thanksgiving, Christmas and New Year’s. My mom and little bother came in from Kentucky for three days to see me and I don’t remember that. My best friend of 30 years, Steve, came everyday after work to sit with me and I don’t remember that either. Both of those things hurt my heart. I’m missing a month of my life. Steve told me a year later something he tried to walk back then sugar coat that the nurses told him and my mom I was very close to death and they didn’t know how well I’d recover cognitively if I survived. IF I survived. My Infectious Disease doctor said I was “very very” sick and the CD4 and viral counts I came in with had me at advanced HIV, AIDS, and I’d more than likely had it for 8-10 years. Yeah.
When I got out I was sober. No drinking on the ICU.  I drank HEAVILY for a good 15 years. I’m talking high functioning, professional level. Never wanted to stop. Didn’t see a need. I was killing myself and didn’t care. I was wrapped in self denial and in a very very dark place for a very very long time. 
I also became vegan. First night in I was famished. Was vegetarian before but wanted something substantial so I got a Salisbury steak. Got mad sick so after that it was salads for lunch and dinner and animal crackers and OJ for breakfast for the month.  I realized that eating meat wasn’t necessary for me to live and it was cruel and conflicted with my Buddhist beliefs at the time, of which I was kinda on the periphery of.
Getting sober and becoming vegan were very good changes for me. Better changes.
And my memory was total shit. Short term was almost nonexistent and I still have issues. What with the concussion, heavy drinking, hard drug use and HIV Associated Neurocognative Disorder (which affects the memory and will only get worse) my memory is shot. My long term is missing huge chunks that I’ll never get back. Steve and my mom will talk about things from the past that I’m sure I was there for but don’t remember…and I want to very much. My memory issues have had an unforeseen consequence: it affects my self esteem. Having to have people remind me of or repeat things or me constantly saying “Stop me if I’ve told you this…” makes me feel idiotic. 
Despite all this, I was given a second chance and clean slate. I’m happier than I can remember, heh heh, and Steve appreciates that. Said I remind him of how I was when we first met. Actually looking forward to the rest of my life.",

I read in the replies about your activism and donations. Big respect. 

Can relate to the whole bodybuilding community and vegans giving you stick at the same time. I get it in the martial arts industry, martial artists can be equally ignorant about veganism and many vegans look down on the ""violence"" of martial arts. I've seen the same thing thrown at vegan body builders usually by some 110lb 6foot tall glass back who has been vegan for 5 minutes and never done any activism.

If you are that concerned I would just add like 10-20g of soy protein isolate as a cheaper alternative.

A vegan diet can make a difference in your labs while using steroids. I'm sure there's a point where nothing helps if you're taking large amounts. But as an n=1 type scenario, I'm on TRT. My test levels are at 600ng/dl, so I'm not taking much. But on my carnivore diet, I had to do a therapeutic phlebotomy every 6 or 8 weeks to keep my hematocrit down.

You can minimize negative effects of gear by getting a prescription from a real doctor who has measured *your* baseline and provides ongoing monitoring of *your unique body chemistry* and then stop taking them if your  doctor says to stop. I'm not sure if it's possible to completely prevent permanent negative side effects.",

l8nbyrt,t1_l8n1lw3,1dfpbs5,"It's an interesting topic that's still being studied - they still haven't been able to fully pinpoint the mechanism, if it exists, that is associated with weed leading to changes in REM. I think weed definitely puts you in a relaxed STATE, and that makes it easier to fall asleep. But something, and I don't know exactly what, COULD be also resulting in less deep sleep. The key observation here is that this is just an association that was uncovered. There was no causation established... Yet...? It may be that people who use weed already struggle with sleep to begin with. With associations, it's tough. To have causation, you need to establish temporal precedence, reduce or try and totally rule out confounding variables, and then, if you can, establish an underlying mechanism to explain how A lead to B.

If you have enough money, you could try and get a sleep study done and smoke weed before it to see how much REM sleep you get, and then you could try and do another one without it. But even then, you would need to control factors like - what you ate that day, stress levels that day, energy expenditure that day, etc.

All of that to say, I generally do feel like I wake up less groggy during my T breaks. And I do feel more energy throughout the day on them too. But we still just don't know yet. :P",

- rice bowls with a whole block of tofu (60g protein). 
- protein pasta with a load of TVP & yeast flakes (50-60gProt)
- granola bowls with soy yoghurt & peanut butter 
- nuts & protein bars throughout the day
- i also consume 1-2 protein shakes a day 

another cheap & easy way to add more high quality protein to your diet, just keep soy milk in the fridge, and try drink close to 1litre throughout the day. It’s an easy 40g protein",

ks49ttw,t1_ks3qwni,1azmkno,I think we should just rename them (saying this as someone in the pharmacy field). Most are not necessarily enhancing performance so much as they are recovery capacity. You still have to bust your ass and perform on your own. You can just recover more efficiently so you can go destroy yourself again. Ronnie Coleman is arguably the best example of this: absolutely destroyed himself in a way that no human with a shred of self preservation/well adapted fear would be able to do. The drugs made it possible but the person did it.,

ks58u1r,t1_ks4piau,1azmkno,I would like to disagree. Usually changes have stages from skinny to begginer gains and then final results. You need to post pictures of those stages between start and now. From our pov you went from skinny to huge and PEDS seemed to have helped. Regardless your physique is amazing.,

ksz6knt,t1_ksxybz7,1azmkno,"Only with diseases like acromegaly. There might be a one in a million exception, but I believe those also might have some sort of underlying condition. 

Acromegaly is uncommon and the physical changes occur slowly over many years, the condition sometimes takes a long time to recognize. 

When your facial structure changes within a few years, you’re on a crazy Frankenstein level of growth hormone. 

Practicioners of fasting and sauna will have highly elevated growth hormones, but they keep the same cranial structure.

I’ve done bloodwork on naturals who are lifting, doing sauna, fasting and are at high levels testosterone and growth hormone. The levels are at the top limit of what is considered normal. Doctors are surprised when they see the charts for that high testosterone and growth hormone. Same facial structure.",
ks4djij,t1_ks49c72,1azmkno,PEDs put on maybe ~10% to your strength and when you see someone you’re sure is using they likely had good genetics in the first place. In general truth is unless someone is doing it for a profession you don’t have a good guess,

kvva3zm,t1_kvo40bw,1biznli,"I’ll try to summarize my diet.

Disclaimer: I have never tried alcohol or any drugs, so those are not part of my life.

I haven’t eaten sugar, candies, or sweets for about 7 years.

I avoid processed foods: I try as much as I can to have a whole food diet. I have 1 cheat meal a week where I allow myself to have a burger, pizza, or something like that.

I cook all my meals. I meal prep twice a week. I use a scale to weigh my meals and separate them into food containers, so it’s easy and fast to heat them up at work or at home.

My grocery shopping list consists of oatmeal, berries, nuts, and seeds (walnuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, chia seeds, flax seeds, hemp seeds), whole grain bread, smoked tempeh (for sandwiches), hummus (I use it for sandwiches instead of mayo), avocado, pea and soy milk, peanut butter, tamari, agave, beans (black, kidney, garbanzo beans), lentils, whole wheat or garbanzo beans pasta, vegetable broth, brown rice, quinoa, limes, sweet potatoes, salad mix, mushrooms, tomatoes, broccoli, cauliflower, zucchini, spinach, bell pepper, asparagus, beets, carrots, tofu, onions, garlic, dry spices such as rosemary, thyme, oregano, basil, parsley, cumin, turmeric, garlic powder, onion powder, curry, black pepper, smoked paprika, Nutritional Yeast (I add it to all my savory meals), bay leaves, Dash Onion (it goes really well with avocado!)

I have five meals a day.

My breakfast has been the same for the past 8 years. I have either a smoothie or overnight oats every single day. The recipe will vary (when I’m bulking I’ll mix quinoa in and add peanut butter for example), but it usually consists of pea milk, oats, flax seeds, chia seeds, pumpkin seeds, hemp seeds, walnuts, coconut flakes, berries, and a scoop of protein powder. I also add creatine and glutamine to this mix.

For my main meals (lunch and dinner), my meals will always consist of brown rice, sweet potatoes or whole grain/garbanzo beans pasta, beans (I rotate between garbanzo beans, black beans, kidney beans) or lentils, tofu or tempeh, and veggies (leafy greens such as salads plus legumes).

For my afternoon snack, I usually have two slices of avocado toast (sometimes I add smoked tempeh to it) and a protein shake.

For dinner, it's the same as lunch.

Before I go to bed, I usually have another slice of bread with hummus and another protein shake.

For my quantities and macros, that comes from my nutritionist.

So, to recap:

No alcohol, no sugar, no processed food.
Main meals consist of a base of brown rice or pasta, always with some kind of beans or lentils, plus leafy greens and legumes.
Two snacks a day, three protein shakes a day.
For supplementation: creatine, glutamine.
Vitamins: CoQ10, Vitamin D, Vitamin C, Probiotics, Omega 3, Turmeric, Antioxidant mix, Folic acid.
I have an annual check-up where I check all my vitamin levels (my B12 levels are always high, so I haven’t supplemented with B12 for the past years).

I hope this helps!",

Sucks you had to deal with those DMs. You should tell them you need to get your microscope",😭
kvtwgs3,t1_kvrbonf,1biznli,"Yeah, that’s exactly what I was expecting unfortunately… 

Funny enough I’m pretty close now to this really awesome woman on r/veganfitness, and she was telling me about how many unsolicited dick pics she keeps on getting. From one post where she showed her physique, that post alone had her receiving 4 unsolicited dick pics. And generally it seems like that’s what happens when a woman posts any picture of herself.

For any guys that are reading this and it’s not obvious: do not send a woman a dick pic unless she explicitly asks. Solicited = ok, unsolicited = not ok. Instead, 
1) learn how to build social skills/emotional intelligence, and learn to flirt.
2) develop a sense of confidence. That doesn’t mean for example, if you don’t have a good singing voice and you have to sing in front of people, that you gaslight yourself into thinking you have an amazing voice. But it means that regardless of situation you’re in, you don’t feel like awkward and out of place, And you feel like your presence there is a good thing to the people around you.

Those 2 things are attractive and actually have a chance of attracting a partner. An unsolicited dick pic doesn’t attract most women: all you’re doing is giving her a (good) reason to block you immediately. Think of it from her perspective: she doesn’t know you well, and has to be weary of whether you’re a creep or not. Do you think an unsolicited dick pic is going to help your case that you’re not a creep?",

While our diet plays a role, veganism encompasses much more than what we eat, it's a philosophy that extends to all aspects of life. If diet were our sole concern, we'd simply label ourselves as ""plant-based."" Throughout my journey as a vegan, the thought of forming or joining an ""anti-meat eaters"" group has never crossed my mind. I choose to live by my beliefs without resorting to hatred or intolerance. The existence of ""anti-vegan"" communities speaks volumes about those who partake in them: it reveals a deep-seated intolerance that underscores their worldview. For those who harbor such intolerance, understanding veganism becomes an uphill battle. Respect and tolerance are essential components of a fulfilling life, and it's evident that these values are sorely lacking in such communities.",

I don’t know where you’re getting your information from but it’s incorrect.

The British Nutrition Foundation has stated that you should aim for 0.75g of protein per Kg of body weight per day. I just saw that post where you said you’re about 330lbs, so if you aim for 115g of protein per day, you’ll be fine.",

I don’t know why, but the more I need to eat, the more I don’t care about food and just do basic cooking.  Less salt, added fat too, I guess.  Whole blocks of tofu, even impossible packs (supplemented very well), straight fruit and coffee in the morning for the liver.  Just going basic with all the variety and timings.  Plus filling in all the pitfalls and the like, helps for sure.  

My biggest contributor has been very low shoe padding and sleeping on the floor for the better part of decade.  You’re just not groggy when waking up, and you’re firmly planted on the ground when doing anything.  That helps a lot with huge muscle stretches to really engage things, especially the back of the legs, lower torso, back of thighs/and butt.  You get the start of golden age body builder posture just engaging things in vivid/new ways.",

Sometimes if your pancreas is not producing enough enzymes, supplementing can help. Aloe Vera is a powerful anti-inflammatory and soothes the GI tract setting you up for the day. Apple cider vinegar provides live cultures for your microbiome, and l-glutamine is an amino acid that is very beneficial for healing and strengthening the gut lining.

lypyec6,t1_lyhny9b,1gxcnxq,"It stands for textured vegetable protein, it’s typically made from soya (soy), but can be made from wheat or peas as well, though a lot less common.

The process it’s made by is similar to how some breakfast cereals are processed, it’s basically steam heated and then pressed into shape, typically (size from smallest to largest) a “mince”, cubes, curls, slices.

Because of how it’s made it is safe to eat without cooking, but it’s not flavoured by default so it’s going to take on the flavour of whatever it’s with and absorb that liquid.

It’s not super common to see it eaten without cooking, but it seems to be popping up more and more!",

lyg96ms,t1_lyg2c1q,1gxcnxq,"I swear to you the secret sauce is just more and more engagement in new ways.  It’s a mind game.   I use it for creative outcomes more than just aesthetics.

Bigger shortcuts I’ve found for the body and mind (which I use for creative pursuits too): coffee in the morning (purely medicinal), slip in vitamin C AWAY from big non-heme iron meals to avoid minor inflammation (Fenton reaction in the gut), protein and vitamin C meals? enjoy a small gut bomb.  It’s a myth you need protein 4-5 times a day unless you’re training 4-5 times a day.  I read study yesterday criticizing the exact study this is built on, which was bare whey protein usage, and they found only 15% oxidation (which means 15% went unused and was deposited as energy) with 100g meals a few times a day.  85g was used for muscle and other processes each of those 100g meals because the protein processes over 4-8 hours. I do a half a block of tofu, half a block of impossible meat (again, supplemented sooooo well), that’s it.  2-3 times a day, minimum 4 hours spaced out.  Not too much carbs with proteinto make the iron levels wonky (glucose and iron and interactive in the body, it’s why they find iron overload in a lot of cases of diabetes).  That’s not a necessary one though.  And I have high fat days and low protein days, even with coconut oil even some ice creams, with high DHA (2-3g) with it, I have vitamin D a few times a week, but vitamin K 100mcg at least once or twice a day.  The high fat days give explosive energy for creativity for me.  Especially if times right.  There’s simple timings to these if you think about digestion time and where things get processed down the line (like iron tends to be processed 10+ hours from a meal).

To me, it’s not about being cut, but a middleground of thick, muscle-y, filled out, but moreso…brain health trumps all.",

They have all actually been super fun with only one of those 100km distance I did not so fun for about half of it but that was a nutritional issue more than anything.

If you build up to it over a few years, you can wack out a 50km in a day with very little though or effort and feel pretty normal the next day and it's all about the adventure outside, being in nature, the wilderness and seeing wildlife and the magic of the planet.",

After my feet toughened up it was just my legs, the left knee mostly that would be in pain for days after a long run. Again, I kept at it and stretched more and didn’t quit. I incorporated strength training and yoga as well. 

I began exercising (running/yoga/HIIT) at the end of 2022, adding strength training & Kickboxing late April 2023. Prior to this I had never worked out. 

Now I can run a 5k and 2 days later…nothing. No foot pain (I had thought I had plantar fasciitis since a lump would usually seem to be the source of pain) and no knee pain. 

Bodies are crazy good at adapting, you just have to keep pushing! I feel superhuman thinking about this because during the pain I did have recurring thoughts of “maybe I’m just like this”. I’m sure being vegan deserves at least partial credit since vegan typically equals less inflammation in general.",

My advice: look for excessive size combined with stage ready lean-ness. Or porptionally oversized / body parts that look unusually large. Also huge changes in a short time period usually = dead giveaway. I see none of these here.

The thinking is 1.5-2x times body weight for protein, then a little bit extra to make sure I’m getting enough as a vegan (bio-availability and leucine, and then a little bit more again to prevent muscle loss in a cut).

-Hi protein tofu scramble on toast



-Pre mix frozen stir fry veggies (but I steam, not fried, to save calories)

-Singapore/hokkien/udon noodles
-mock meat (seitan or mixed protein blends)



-roast veggies
-tofu/tempeh/mock meat/protein chunks



-berry bowl
-protein powder



Herbs and spices and vegan gravy’s make it taste different each time so I don’t get bored.

The vast majority of people can’t look this good without the extra help of steroids or SARMs. 90%+, 95%+, 99%+?

I don’t necessarily doubt this guy, but I do think it’s a fair question. 

In particular, the low body fat and vascularity. Many people would consider themselves natty still if they were just taking DNP/Clenbuterol/Amp/etc. Some would still say they’re natty having taken SARMs. 

I think taking steroids is a perfectly reasonable thing to do. It can be done safely and to great effect. Far more people are doing it than care to admit publicly.

A body like that without PED's is rare and that's just the facts, because for most people, even with the hard work and dedication, the high plateau is one with less mass as their muscles naturally produce more miostatin as they grow.

That’s why I commented on somebody elses comment, so that somebody else other than you could respond if they knew more. Idk why you seem to be getting a bit pressed

And yeah, testosterone is a steroid. I don’t know why you linked to the wikipedia article on steroids? I’m not “changing any narrative”, it might more make sense if you read the rest of my comments in this thread. Multiple different steroids are used for bodybuilding, yes, but testosterone is the one i’ve been mostly focused on in my comments because that’s the one I gotta use for a medical condition lol. But my research wasn’t limited to testosterone, didn’t see it being used for tren or anything else. Still would be fine with seeing a link for any type of steroid synthesized for human use being derived from animals, as i’m just interested in the topic in general now.

In terms of lanosterol, them “being used in animal cells”, from what I read, means that when animals are making testosterone inside their cells, they use lanosterol. So it’s used inside of animal cells when the cells are synthesizing testosterone themselves. But steroids for human use have to be outside of animal cells in order for us to use them, and I didn’t see anything about lanosterol being used for synthesis of any steroids in forms that we could use (i.e., outside of an animal cell; i.e. in a lab).

Sorry for any inconvenience or something. But I am not asking you specifically to keep justifying that you don’t know more about steroids and haven’t taken them; you’ve stated this numerous times.

""The linguistic rules apply to both and all Western European languages""

obviously they don\`t as there are many differences between english and german. as i pointed out one of them is the use of capital letters. if i were to write english with the same linguistic rules it would kinda like this: ""I am from Germany, we write every Noun with Capital Letters.

On the ""volume"" workout I go to failure with just enough rest to finish the sets. If I'm not able to get both workouts in during the week then I alternate them between weeks.

The first workout emphasizes strength:

1. Overhead Barbell Press- 2 set x 10 reps warm up, 5 sets x 5 reps heavy, working weight, 5-10 reps burnout weight
2. Dumbbell Side Lateral Raises- 5 sets x 10 reps
3. Cable Up Right Rows- 5 sets x 10 reps

2. Cable Side Lateral Raises- 5 sets x 10 reps
3. EZ Curl Bar Front Raises- 5 sets x 10 reps

The daily calorie goal to get 200-400 calories excess over my calories burned. Finally I try to get my weekly macros to average around 60% carbs, 30% protein, 10% fat. 

I don't track every day, but I do keep my protein number in my head. If I'm making a meal for the first time then that's when I'll meticulously calculate the macros in it.

1. Lats and Biceps- Curl Variation, Lat Pull Down, Cable Row, Curl Variation
2. Chest and Triceps- Bench Variation, Cable Fly, Dips, Machine Bench Variation
3. Lower Back, Hamstrings, and Accessory- RDLs, Barbell Shrug, Leg Curl Machine, T Bar Row, Grip/Forearm Work
4. Delts- Overhead Press, Side Lateral Raise, Upright Row, Reverse Fly
5. Legs, Glutes- Squat/Leg Press, Leg Extension, Hip Adduction/Abduction Machine, Glute Press Machine

I throw ab work in periodically depending on how much time I have.

This split might be considered an older methodology, but it has worked for me. I've been doing a version of it for many years now. I think the main benefit is recovery time. The muscle group isolation and days spacing mean there's not much crossover between muscle groups.

That being said, I've been reading and watching, as we all do, and I've seen some new ideas for routines. So I'll probably be playing around with that in the near future.",

Basically, if you are trying to eke out every bit of gains possible, the research suggests you could go up to 0.8g/lb. For the rest of us 0.64g/lb is probably fine! For you that would be 108 grams of protein, which should be doable. I eat a whole food vegan diet (i.e. not especially shooting for high protein) and regularly get in this range without supplementing or eating high protein foods like seitan. If you want higher protein percent due to lower TDEE, you could always use protein powder and more processed but still healthy foods like seitan to get you there pretty easily.

There's always new research coming out regarding muscle protein synthesis and this could be ""less optimal"" as time passes

It's safer to err on the side of more than less protein (for muscle protein synthesis) so 0.8 should be the goal you're aiming for. Even aiming for 1.0 is fine. 

On a vegan diet, the digestibility of the protein matters. 100g of protein from straight seitan does not all get utilized towards muscle protein synthesis compared to 100g of protein from meat/dairy/fish/tofu. That being said, I am aware you must combine foods to have a healthy diet. However, there's only one study on what proper foods to combine to best boost digestibility - that isn't comprehensive enough :(

I get in that extra protein by using protein powder on the days I eat vegan but that kinda goes to show you it's quite hard to reach that protein goal for bodybuilding by staying strictly whole foods plant based lol. FYI I don't need to use protein powder to hit my protein goal on days I eat meat/fish",
l4ci2lu,t1_l4c9ldk,1csnyy5,"Answering inline:

> There's always new research coming out regarding muscle protein synthesis and this could be ""less optimal"" as time passes

This is a meta-analysis of multiple studies of muscle-protein synthesis for bodybuilding. I think .8g is fine to target if you want, but I operate on the basis that the person making claims has to provide the evidence. That more evidence may come in in the future isn't compelling to me—it could also come in on the lower side! I operate on what we know now.

> On a vegan diet, the digestibility of the protein matters. 100g of protein from straight seitan does not all get utilized towards muscle protein synthesis compared to 100g of protein from meat/dairy/fish/tofu.

However, there's only one study on what proper foods to combine to best boost digestibility - that isn't comprehensive enough :(

This effect is small and you can adjust for it. Protein combining doesn't have to happen at every bite or meal, you just need all essential amino acids, which a varied diet will get you. You are making the claim, so it's up to you to provide the evidence, but I found one showing multiple plant foods with 85-95% digestibility, or 99% if you include protein powders. https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6723444/

FYI I don't need to use protein powder to hit my protein goal on days I eat meat/fish

I was just giving an example of what works for me. I'm not a body builder. Most body builders do supplement protein, whether vegan, or omnivore. Being vegan is a moral philosophy, not a diet, so if you find that moral philosophy compelling and want to adhere to it you can find a way to make it work. But I will say that for everyday fitness (not competitive bodybuilding) my experience has supported just eating a varied plant based diet.",
l4duic7,t1_l4ci2lu,1csnyy5,"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6723444/

Not sure if you eat 100g protein of tempeh, then 2g of essential amino acids supplement then all that 100g of protein will be digested. I think It needs more studies to confirm this

>  Being vegan is a moral philosophy, not a diet, so if you find that moral philosophy compelling and want to adhere to it you can find a way to make it work.

Tofu/Tempeh: 200g/83g 

Lentils/beans/chickpeas: 55g

TVP/Soya chunks/granules: 65g 

Rice/quinoa/tortilla/ bread/potatoes: ~100g

 (vegan) Protein powder: 30g protein x 2 scoops

Oats: 40g 

Nuts: ~20g;Veggies: 200g & Fruits: 200-300g
Miscellaneous: Hemp seeds, chia seeds

Supplements: creatine (5g) not a must, vegan alpha omega 3 for dry eyes 

Started with Strength training 5 days per week at home with adjustable dumbbells, but I currently do CrossFit 3 days per week for functional fitness.

It might seem,  like I stuck to the diet all the time but there were many deviations. I had to travel, then I got covid and then I got hives. So took a lot of time to recover health and cardio wise..

I did 90 day sprints as a 90 day fitness challenge 3 times and that helped me stick with the plan. Plus o has a coach.

m7qemto,t1_m7psmfe,1i3mqo6,"It’s a cliche but true: it’s 80% diet and 20% workouts 

Diet helped with the weight loss and the exercise helped with the ‘fat’ loss..

The exercise helped retain and build some muscle which in turn helped with burning more calories through the day. 

But without being in calorie deficit, we cannot lose any weight.. (and it’s hard to know without measuring food and weight and even other measurements to tell whether it’s working)",

lln3m0s,t1_lllrgqz,1f95s3c,It's actually even harder than that because the limiting factor is not your bicep or lat strength it's going to be tiny muscles in your shoulder center and stabilize your body. I watched a youtube series where a guy trained for it and the last few inches gave him a lot of trouble and he had to specific one arm assisted work to reach it.,
lln2qoz,t1_llmvkxp,1f95s3c,"In the past I’ve gotten criticism on my pull-up form. For “bouncing” too much as a result of just dropping and using it to an unfair advantage that results in an unexpected swing and kip. So to mitigate that, I do expend energy by controlling my negative. At the same time, it’s a little easier on my grip because there’s less heavy weight being dropped suddenly on my grip.",

llmb6b1,t1_llkiomk,1f95s3c,Nice! The Nebraska state fair had no options at all but I should have guessed it was the worst of all state fairs in this regard (“the beef state”),
llknax0,t1_lljt6cj,1f95s3c,"I know you aren’t asking me, but the way I trained to do more is as follows:

First, to get your starting point do as many pull-ups as you can like OP did in this video and then cut it in half. So if your max is 10, then your starting point would be 5. 

I would do this on my off days and weekends so Tuesdays, Thursdays, Saturdays, and Sundays. 

Day one:  3 sets of five pull-ups spread out throughout the day: 5, 5, 5

Day 2:  5,5,6

Day 3:  5,6,6

Day 4: 6,6,6

One day a week in a regular workout, I would do one set of weighted pull-ups and if I could do more than five pull-ups with that weight than I would up the weight by 5 pounds the next week.

Then just continue the pattern as time goes on and you’ll be a pull up god. 

So just for clarity the next week, following this:

Day 1: 6,6,6

Day 2: 6,6,7

Day 3: 6,7,7

Day 4: 7,7,7

This really worked for me and I think it can work for everybody",

I eat a protein oatmeal bowl almost every single day because it tastes like crack to me (lol) and is so easy to make. One serving of oats, myprotein impact soy mocha protein, bananas, hemp seeds, flaxseed meal, blueberries, raisins, granola and some peanut butter. Usually about 850 calories. 

Lunch is usually some sort of a quick stir fry/bowl with a lot of veggies since I don’t have much time for lunch break. Usually something like super firm tofu, seitan or tempeh, garbanzo beans or black beans, then a slew of veggies like broccoli, carrots, spinach, artichoke hearts, kale, string beans, cauliflower, pretty much anything I have ha. Maybe a scoop of hummus or guac. Usually pretty light at 450-500 calories.

Dinner is usually pretty big and switches the most. Black bean pasta with TVP, crushed tomatoes, spinach, broccoli, peas, nooch, etc or burritos or tacos with black beans, seitan, corn, spinach, peppers, etc. Or maybe a couple Boca burgers with air fries and veggies. I switch that up a lot! Usually like 800-1000 calories. 

“Dessert” might be a smoothie bowl with soy protein, almond milk, bananas, blueberries, mangos, spirulina, strawberries, chia/hemp seeds, maybe peanut butter topped with granola. 500-700 calories probably.

Usually throw in a snack of like… veggies and hummus or a protein bar or something and some seltzer or black coffee if it’s early. 3k calories a day usually, 160-185g protein usually and 75-100g fat. carbs fall where they fall haha. Hope that helps!",

lckg7a5,t1_lcjlfm8,1dzw3n9,"No way, I was the definition of skinny fat in high school. Never saw my abs until like age 23 after focusing on progressive overload on compound barbell movements with higher weekly frequency and volume. Combine that with repeated bulks and cuts and now it’s easy to stay lean if I want to!",
lcpi1ps,t1_lclmw3z,1dzw3n9,"Dude that's amazing!! It's a long game - sounds like you're absolutely killin it!

Biggest thing 10000% in my opinion is tracking calories/macros with a food scale and tracking app like myfitnesspal or cronometer. It's such a gamechanger. Just eliminates the biggest variables and makes manipulating body weight down to simple math.

I think my approach to bulking/cutting is pretty straight forward. I like starting a bulk with about a 200-300 calorie surplus and track my bodyweight on a scale until it plateaus for a few weeks in a row. I only aim for an average of roughlyyyy 1 lb of weight gain per week. From there, I just go in 100 calorie bumps to my daily calories, rinse and repeat judging by the scale, mostly. I personally would never bulk over roughly 20% body fat for my goals. Macros are usually about 0.7g-1g/lb/bw for protein per day, fat usually 80-110g, carbs just fall where they fall but towards the end of a bulk when I'm at like 4k calories, it can get super high ha. I reallyyyy try to push progressive overload and volume because this is where you'll be growing.

For cuts, same idea but subtracting instead of adding calories. I try to increase protein the further I get into a cut too compared to bulks and I will always aim for a minimum of about 50-60g fat. Carbs are the biggest variable. I still train super hard during my cuts but it can be a blow to your ego seeing your big barbell compound lifts go down so I tend to incorproate more weighted bodyweight stuff, machines and other fun variations. Volume is lower than during bulks too just because it takes less stimulus to maintain muscle and let's be real, after 15 years of lifting naturally I'm not going to be growing during a cut LOL

Happy to talk more anytime if you wanna connect on IG or message here! My IG is the same name, @ tofustrong",
lcpf7dh,t1_lclv0p9,1dzw3n9,Thank you very much for the kind words!! 🙏,🙏
lcpjpu3,t1_lcm52hf,1dzw3n9,"Forrrr sure. If I could go back, I'd tell myself this:

1.) Train compound movements primarily with a barbell. Squat, horizontal press, vertical press, horizontal row, vertical row and hip hinge/deadlift. So important to learn these movement patterns and I strongly believe (despite what a lot of ""fitness gurus"" say nowadays) that free weights are king PARTICULARLY for newcomers and intermediates. Isolation exercsies and machines have their place but use in moderation as a beginner and for isolations, use at end of workout after compounds  
2.) Focus on progressive overload. Start low and slow but aim to add 2.5-5 lbs per week or two for all major movements. If you can't do that, then add a set. If you can't anymore and you feel beat up, reset the weights/volume 10-20% lower and repeat.  
3.) Hit each muscle 2-3x per week  
4.) Start tracking calories/macros using a food scale and myfitnesspal/cronometer. Eat in a small surplus for a long period of time.  
5.) Prioritize good form and a nice range of motion for each lift. Drop the ego - you'll get strong eventually  
6.) Rest 2-4 minutes in between sets. It might sound liek a lot but when you're training hard and proper, you should feel like you really need that time to hit the next set HARD again!

There's probably several more but these are huge! Hope that helps :)",

lckhecb,t1_lck4cs1,1dzw3n9,I feel like I speak for 97.82491% of vegans when I say smooth as (vegan) silk,
lcpm9cj,t1_lco2rp3,1dzw3n9,"That's awesome you're considering going back to eating more plant based again! It's not always easy culturally, of course, so mad props to you.   
  
I'm not gonna lie, I don't think I've ever really felt ""bad"" on any diet, but I also cut out meat 13 years ago when I was but a wee lad and vegan 8.5 years ago now. Even before I cut out meat, I ate a decent amount of fruits and vegetables. So to put it simply, I didn't notice any difference between any type of eating BESIDES when I was doing GOMAD as a lacto-ovo vegetarian and got crazy acne and my digestive tract hated me lol. I do feel more lethargic on the tail end of a bulk just from eating so much damn food (4k+ cal/day) and weighing more but besides that, yeah, haven't ever really noticed a difference.   
  
For me, it's all about the ethics. If I can live my life without supporting an industry that inherently involves suffering and death of other sentient beings, then I would take that EVEN IF there was a trade off. Fortunately, we see from countless studies now that strict vegetarian, plant based diets have a myriad of health benefits including reduced chance of heart disease, stroke, certain cancers, diabetes, lower BMI, blood pressure, and so on. Plus, I'm a big environmentalist and absolutely terrified of what us humans have done to the planet and a plant based diet is one of the best things we can do as an average individual to offset our personal carbon footprints and vote with our dollar for a better future. So for those reasons, it's very beneficial to my mental health to align my morals with my actions. 

Happy to talk more about this anytime if you ever want to shoot me a DM or message me on IG at @ tofustrong",

lcjtl0t,t1_lcjpgrd,1dzw3n9,"Not saying direct ab work isn’t useful! I just think I really needed to build some overall mass first, personally.

lda2jm4,t1_ld8ijo7,1dzw3n9,So I actually do cosplay and this has me seriously debating this for the next one LOL,
lda0wf3,t1_lctda2c,1dzw3n9,"When I'm prioritizing strength/physique, it's 5x per week ""full body"" but I usually have a focus for each day. I mainly just plan weekly frequencies for each movement and block them in where they fit appropriately and I find that splits are just too limiting for that.  
  
 So for example, I hit a squat/quad focused movements 2-4x per week, a hinge 2x per week usually, a horziontal press (bench usually) 2-4x per week, a vertical press 2-3x per week, and vertical/horizontal pulls 4-5x per week. Plus usually isolation work for arms, shoulders and abs 1-3x per week. Usually I'll group my horizontal press with my squat and have one of those days with each of those lifts first. Same with vertical press and a hinge movement. And I throw in a vertical OR horizontal pull in each of those days and then some isolation work to compliment the main compounds of the day. So those are 4 days and day 5 is usually overflow for whatever other exercises need more work and didn't fit in days 1-4.

Hope that makes sense! I've played around with SO many different types of programming, volumes, frequencies, and any other variable you can think of over the years and I find that this seems to work the best for me, both mentally and physically!",

Using between 500mg and 1000mg of total gear a week and having diet and training down 100% made a much bigger difference. 

So it's not nearly as simple as taking gear and sitting at home. Or taking gear and lifting. Or taking gear and dieting. You have to do it all - I have worked with over 50 athletes that came to me using gear. Less is more, they all made better progress when dropping dose and honing in on training and diet. Not just the drugs. It's one aspect. Yes, naturals are and always will be smaller than enhanced, but you can't just hop on a cycle and expect to see drastic changes. All the bases have to be covered.",

kp7w61e,t1_kp7g481,1aiw0jd,"I’d love to see the study! I’d have no doubt the steroid users would gain muscle even without training, doctors will give them to coma patients to prevent too much muscle loss. 


There’s quite a lot of variables, previously untrained/trained? Protein intake? What steroids and what dose? Testosterone levels before and after of all participants?


I’d expect to see muscle growth in enhanced+no exercise exceeding natty+exercise in trained individuals only really. 


I’m essentially saying it would surprise me to see a couch potato injecting steroids gain significantly more muscle than a natty with noob gains.

The starter, soy, and tofu goes into a blender for 20 seconds, and then overnight into a Crockpot on yoghurt setting. I used to add vanilla essence the following morning but now enjoy the flavour without. I strain using a cheesecoth, rubberband, colander, and giant plastic bowl for two hours. The yoghurt is stored in a 2.5 litre jar. I probably don't need to strain for two hours because the consistency is a bit too cottage cheese but I use these two hours to do other food prep, rolling boxing wraps, other domestic chores and the timing otherwise works for me.

I alternate between overnight oats (55g) and overnight buckwheat (55g) with 15g pumpkin seeds, 15g chia seeds, 100g soy drink, 60g frozen blueberries, 20g walnuts, 1/5 of the yoghurt. 970 kcal, 51g protein. This is my largest meal of the day.

There’s no emotional pain like being betrayed by someone you care about. I’m so sorry. I promise someday you will be grateful for her as a strengthening stepping stone on your personal growth and life journey. 

You deserve better. You deserve love and loyalty. Take care of you for awhile! Watch movies play video games do hobbies whatever you want because no one can tell you no!",

You’ve gained more time to focus on yourself, your passion, your activism… and you lost someone who’s obviously doesn’t have the emotional capacity to be in a healthy adult relationship. In other words, the trash took itself out!!

It’s (vegan) cheesy and cliche, but it does get better.. maybe not now, or next week, or even in the next few months. But one day you’ll wake up and won’t have that pit in your stomach and the thought of her won’t make your feel *as* heartbroken as you had been. Just take it one day at a time, love yourself along the way, and give yourself space & time to feel sad. This too shall pass :)",

ljk8k7o,t3_1exuulw,1exuulw,Probably what will turn out to be the love of your life is looking at you with that medicine ball thinking why is he doing that?..,
ljp33c6,t3_1exuulw,1exuulw,I can see you turning into a vegan Saitama soon.,
lk507z7,t3_1exuulw,1exuulw,"The fact that she avoided you for 9 days speaks of her maturity. Communication is key in a relationship and her behaviour is shallow, immature, and inconsiderate. Knowing who she really is is a blessing and you will see it as such in time. 

We have to learn how to communicate and even if you did end up together, would you get a no show for days everytime something went wrong? That would drive anyone nuts. 

Sounds like you have some internal work to do and it’s vital if you want to avoid attracting these types of women. Confidence, self respect, and self love will keep these types at bay. 

And let your emotions out. Cry or vent as much as needed. But not too long. You have love to look forwarded to and give it time. But please cut this one off. She’s all games and immaturity. I see men keeping beautiful but flaky and flighty women around all the time. But don’t settle for this and look for other values instead like kindness, compassionate, reliable and all in all a good person.

We really get what we put out there, and we get what we THINK we deserve. It’s a bitter pill to swallow, but empowering. 

Sorry but she sounds like a jerk. No time for that! Good luck to you and keep your chin up. When success rolls back around, these types tend to resurface. Be strong and hang on. And move on. Love awaits. All the best!",

lja45kz,t1_lj8m5gn,1exuulw,"so sorry too, her loss! also, emotions are import and it’s ok to cry and you’ll feel better later, bottling it up only makes it worse in the long run",
ljdazjx,t1_lj8m5gn,1exuulw,That’s frustrating… so sorry. A little communication goes a long way. Ghosting should be left for stalkers and those political texts/calls we’ve all been getting.,
lj9oqox,t1_lj8m0f7,1exuulw,"Agree - 3 days max for emotional eating, then it's time to get back into your routine. Because getting fat or losing muscle gains on top of relationship trouble is only going to make you feel even worse, not better.

Plus, the more you work in improving yourself inside and out, the more relationship options you'll have.  Don't be stuck in whatever cycle your ex is in.  She gave you the gift of a valuable lesson in the importance of communication, in the form of what not to do.  So you've already grown past her :)",
lj9ct0i,t1_lj9c9l2,1exuulw,Based,
lj9tggl,t1_lj8o5qi,1exuulw,I'm not quite sure what the term is for what she was. She made an effort to reduce animal product consumption for the environment and ate less than most non vegans / vegetarians. But she still consumed animal products. So. Whatever thats called.,
lj8qxdo,t1_lj8o5qi,1exuulw,What an odd question.,
ljp3gud,t1_ljp33c6,1exuulw,"I actually have a very thick, full head of hair, I just shave it off anyway. I'm sandpaper bald not smooth bald lol",
lk54eef,t1_lk507z7,1exuulw,"Oh its worse than that. She just never spoke to me ever again. I had to find out what happened through a friend. She ""broke up with me"" by just randomly blocking my number one day and fucking some guy from work. One day everything is fine, she says she loves me, no cause for concern, the next no contact with no explanation. 

🙃",🙃
lj9t02i,t1_lj8ml39,1exuulw,"I don't understand how this is supposed to be a gotcha. Yeah I had suspicions I was about to get dumped? I didn't know what was going on and was holding out hope there was a rational explanation and we were going to stay together? That doesn't contridict anything I've said? You're just being a confrontational dick for litterally no reason. If you want to try to insult me and put me down at least do it in a way thats logically coherent. 

And yeah I'd love to hear her side of the story but unfortunately she decided to just ghost me instead of actually breaking up with me like a normal person so unfortunately I have no idea 🙃",🙃
lj9i246,t1_lj9hqzc,1exuulw,I think its because she's a cheater and toxic and abusive and just did a very good job hiding it for about 6 months.,
lj8seu9,t1_lj8oj81,1exuulw,At least now I can upgrade to a vegan model? 💀,💀
ljahdwx,t1_lj8t3ez,1exuulw,"There’s two sides to every story. While ghosting is not usually the best answer, we don’t know if he was abusive or toxic to a point where she felt like she had no option. OP is not going to admit that on here if that’s the case.",

lj9tzhn,t1_lj9tggl,1exuulw,A person that doesn’t align their values with their actions and it shows. You should try Veggly. I found my fiancée on there. I stopped entertaining non-vegans.,
lj8s6qz,t1_lj8qxdo,1exuulw,Not really. Shows level of emotional intelligence and empathy.,
lj9fvf9,t1_lj8qxdo,1exuulw,It's not odd on the vegan fitness sub.,
ljp3jjs,t1_ljp3gud,1exuulw,Saitama had a full head of hair before he became a badass too.,
lk63ooc,t1_lk54eef,1exuulw,That’s so terrible! I’m sorry you went through that. You’re better off without. Time will heal and you will find someone worthy of your time and affection. Hugz!,
lk64y0r,t1_lk54eef,1exuulw,"That’s not love. She wouldn’t know it if it hit her in the rear. All the more reason why you are better off without. There is nothing wrong with no t wanting to be with someone, but there is something wrong with the way it was dpne here. You didn’t deserve this and being lied to and ghosted. BUT——- I think that we all encounter experiences tailored to make us stronger and wiser. You have a golden opportunity here. And I know you’ll grow past this eventuality. Take care of yourself! Hugz!",
lj9i590,t1_lj9i246,1exuulw,Ahh got it,
lj90wuv,t1_lj8seu9,1exuulw,"Definitely. When I decided to leave my ex for unrelated reasons I decided my next bf would be vegan. Enter veggieconnection.com (before the time of apps) and now we’ve been married 9 years and have two kids. So definitely go for the upgraded vegan model SO!!

Best of luck to you!",
ljd0x7i,t1_ljahdwx,1exuulw,I mean most bad things done by people could be justified in some scenarios. I don't think it's fair to withhold sympathy from all victims just because there are hypothetical scenarios where they were actually the ones in the wrong.,
lj9sjts,t1_lj9n6uj,1exuulw,"Yeah, to be clear im a feminist, fuck the patriarchy. I think men can and should cry and there's no shame in it. That being said, I also grew up in a culture that instilled in me that I can't cry or show emotions. And even if I know that's artificial, harmful programming. I can't just turn it off. So ill often know I should cry, want to cry, and just be unable to anyway. Its kind of the worst of both worlds. Like that feeling when you almost sneeze but don't 🙃

So, when I cant cry, which is usually, I find other outlets for the emotion. Like rolling a Boulder up a hill.",🙃
ljad89s,t1_lja9deq,1exuulw,Eta?,
lja1ave,t1_lj9tzhn,1exuulw,Basically zero dating pool in my area. Theres like 10k people in my town and most of them are retirees. But perhaps whenever I move to the big city haha.,
lj9a1cv,t1_lj8s6qz,1exuulw,"Meh, there’s plenty of people who might agree with vegan philosophy and lead a vegan lifestyle but are not great people. Russell Brand, Harley Johnson (DurianRider), etc… unfortunately I do think some horrible people may use veganism as a mask so when their abuse is outed it seems less believable because “They’re vegan! They’re obviously a caring person!” Much in the same way as people hiding behind their religion… I wouldn’t say it’s the majority ofc but being vegan ≠ being a good person :/",
lj8wzi6,t1_lj8s6qz,1exuulw,Agreed. My guess is she probably wasn’t vegan - not saying every vegan is perfect but I think we have a bit more decency and self awareness than that.,
ljp3rg1,t1_ljp3jjs,1exuulw,"Fair. Maybe one day I'll get there. 

Side note. I haven't eaten in 2 days. But I feel like going for a run. Good idea? Bad idea?",

ljbe8yy,t1_lj9sjts,1exuulw,"You know what’s wild? I’m transmasculine and one thing that really fucks with me is that before starting hormone therapy (testosterone), I was someone that would cry fairly frequently. At movies, at thoughts, at things in the world. When I was upset for sure. Now though? It is literally harder to cry. I still can sometimes, but there are all these moments that I recognize as places where I would cry and want to cry but it’s somehow juuuust out of reach. It’s a very strange and disorienting feeling!",

ljb07tr,t1_ljad89s,1exuulw,edited to add,
lja5k7s,t1_lja1ave,1exuulw,Shucks. I’m sorry. Going to vegan restaurants might help or joining your local vegan group on Facebook or Meetup. Good luck 💚,💚
lj9ripf,t1_lj9a1cv,1exuulw,these celebrities also say they’re vegan. Just like horse riding Billie Eilish. There’s no way of knowing. But someone able to respect other living beings on the day to day basis usually is a better person than most. Which is why I asked.,
ljp4gtl,t1_ljp3rg1,1exuulw,"Bad idea. You wouldn't want your blood sugar to go low while running.

Have some electrolytes with you, at least.",
ljbhbag,t1_ljbe8yy,1exuulw,I hear a lot of trans women report the opposite. Its definitely at least partially a hormonal thing. But the sociological factor is also huge.,
lja35yo,t1_lj9ripf,1exuulw,"I understand what you mean but I still think this is a dangerous sentiment to push. By your logic anyone can “claim” they’re vegan, even non-celebrities. We see on these subs all the time people claiming to be vegan but eating animals, using their byproducts, etc… the thing is you never know someone’s true motives behind why they do things or the “image” they want to put to the world. Even though we’re a small niche subgroup, we’re still a part of the general population as a whole and unfortunately a lot of the general population are not great people, for whatever reason. Trying to make it seem like because someone is vegan they’re less likely to be a bad person or abusive is silly. That’s like people trying to say that because someone is Christian they’re automatically a better person (or less likely to be a bad person) than non-Christians because Christianity is built on the teachings of Jesus Christ which are about love, empathy, taking care of those less fortunate, etc., which should be true in theory but in practice that’s not true. Vegans make good choices on behalf on animals, of course, but that doesn’t always translate to their human relationships unfortunately.",
lja5deh,t1_lja35yo,1exuulw,Being vegan transcends beyond the animals on your plate. It’s a way of life. Vegans are usually more empathetic as compared to those who are not vegan by their actions alone.,
ljdpe46,t1_lja5deh,1exuulw,"My take is that the same underlying traits that lead people to be vegan lead to other things. Don't focus too much on the vegan bit, its just a symptom of the real underlying factors.",
ljal2xy,t1_lja5deh,1exuulw,"That would be the assumption but like I said, in practice, not necessarily true. The lifestyle of abstaining from the use of animal products (and the philosophy behind it) doesn’t always translate to emotional maturity & integrity in regards to interpersonal human relationships. Should it? Yes, and I think for many people it does. But I also think for many people it doesn’t unfortunately :/",

A typical day since starting my new way of eating is brown rice cakes topped with hummus, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, cinnamon, cardamom, and cloves and a OWYN protein shake. Lunch I love to do a stir fry since I can get a lot of volume of veggies in. So I’ll do snow peas, broccoli, green beans, bell peppers, and carrots mixed with a cup of brown rice and two tbsp of amino acids. Sometimes if I have time to bake chickpeas I’ll season some and put those in the oven and add them to my stir fry for some crunch. Add in another OWYN protein shake lol. I also have a smoothie in the morning that’s usually banana, pineapple, spinach, blueberries, moringa, tahini, and date syrup. Dinner is usually a bit of a guess for me lol my go do is just a baked sweet potato since it’s so easy or baked butternut squash. Sometimes if I don’t feel like cooking though I will just grab a bowl of cereal with soy milk or a Better Brand bagel. At Sprouts I found this brand of cereal called Three Wishes that I really like that has clean ingredients. I hope this helps!",

lykf2gc,t1_lyjbsrb,1gxoyhi,"I’ve never done a bulk, I try to eat around my maintenance calories (12-16 cal/lbs). I eat what I like, mostly from [Isa’s cookbooks](https://www.theppk.com). The new Fake Meat book is amazing, I want to make everything in there.",
lykfa2u,t1_lyke2aa,1gxoyhi,I wish I’d taken lifting seriously at that age! I was still just doing curls and bench back then and didn’t get into compound lifts until later.,
lykkr97,t1_lyk3cls,1gxoyhi,"Thanks! But the only code is, “eat well, lift heavy, be consistent and get right back at it if you stumble.” 
I don’t follow a meal plan other than:

Intermittent fasting. I eat in an 8 hour window each day. I don’t know if it really provides any optimization, but it keeps me from eating like a jerk.

Protein shake in the morning. Almond milk, powder from truenturition.com (no affiliate, it’s just way cheaper than alternatives and reliable), creatine, peanut butter, oats, fruit. 

Protein: 6-.8g/lbs of body weight. Balance carbs and fat.

Calories: I aim for 12/lbs of body weight, but usually end up around 15, which is maintenance anyway. I’ve never bulk/cut cycled.

Alcohol doesn’t feel great anymore, I can feel a drink for days afterwards, so I’m minimizing that.

And that’s it. Seitan is my go to protein, dark green veggies are good for you 😄",😄
lyn7rug,t1_lylze1e,1gxoyhi,"I don’t know if it impacted it? For one thing, even though I feel very strongly about it, I would say up front that I don’t expect other people to live the way I do. And the other thing is, I try to be self reliant. It’s much, much easier to go out to eat and find options now, and if I was going to a gathering, I would make sure that I took care of myself and didn’t burden anyone else. But it also serves as a filter for who you want to date. If someone hates the idea of veganism, they aren’t going to match with you, and you wouldn’t have wanted to match with them, so that saves you both time and effort. Another side of that is, compassion and conviction are generally attractive traits. So I think it served me fine. At the early stages of dating, I just have fun meeting people anyway, so I wasn’t never looking for a “long term vegan cooking partner” or anything. And it’s a good opener, like if someone wants to try the new pizza place with a vegan option.",
lyizt35,t1_lyiyqn8,1gxoyhi,"Compound lifts every other day, reverse pyramid training (two sets to warm up, 4-8 reps peak weight, 6 reps 10% less, 8 reps another 10% less). 

Day 1, squat and deadlift. 
Day 2a, bench and overhead press. 
Day 2b (next day, or same if I don’t have time) barbell row and lateral raises, hanging straight leg raises. 
Day 3, squat and deadlift. 
Day 4, incline dumbbell press, weighted pull-ups, lateral raises, hanging straight leg raises.

I’ve been cycling citrulline malate, but that’s more for fun than actual progress. Anything else close to supplementation is herbs and vitamins. Daily multivitamin, boron, zinc/magnesium, tongkat ali. Who knows of any of that matters.",
lymg588,t1_lymbmgw,1gxoyhi,"I aim for 12 calories per pound of body weight if I’m trying to trim down. Under normal circumstances I aim for 12 but usually end up around 15. I’m not strict about macros, but my rough targets are 20% protein (.6-.8g per pound of body weight), 30% fat, 50% carbs.

I would suggest timing for losing 5 pounds, and eating at 12 calories per that target weight. Use a food scale and meticulously track calories and ingredients (especially cooking oil, etc). Don’t eyeball portions or quantities, people have been demonstrated to be bad at that. Lift heavy, get 10,000 steps and do not count them against your (his) calories! Walking tricks the body, it generates less hunger than running. 

But losing weight that’s been there a long time, the body develops a sort of hormonal stasis and it’s tricky to fight against. There are techniques people try for that but I’m not knowledgeable in them. Good luck!",

The truth is steroids are entirely uncontrolled in how they’re made so the list of potential side effects is pretty much endless because who knows what’s really in them…along with the fact there aren’t expansive studies on them (illegal) so they’re potentially even more harmful than we know. 

I probably average two beers a month and smoke some pot maybe three times a year. Those have harmful side effects when abused sure, but I’m not using them frequently enough to really experience them. Steroid users love to have that as a fall back but the reality is you’d have to be abusing alcohol or drugs to see serious side effects which of course most people would look down on.

l6tc5ib,t1_l6t94bt,1d6ihu3,"Not much of a secret, but you absolutely have to eat, a lot, more than you'll even like- but you will get used to it.

Bear in mind it is next to impossible to eat 3/4k calories clean, when I was doing my last bulk at 4500cals I'd try my best to keep as much of it clean as possible but there was a lot of beyond burgers, home made fries (which are just potatoes in an air fryer so not exactly 'dirty'), enough weetabix to turn your stomach, whatever I could to hit my target. But I've also been doing this a long ass time so it's from many years of trial and error and discomfort (I wasn't always vegan during previous bulks but was veggie for 15 years also)

I suggest, if you struggle getting your calories in, to drink as much of them as possible. You can make 1k+ shakes if you have any kind of blender, here's an example off the top of my head

2 Banana, 2 scoops protein powder, 2 tsp peanut Butter, 1 tsp Olive Oil, Chia Seeds, half a cup of oats, lots of soy (more protein)/almond 'milk' or substitute of choice

This will round close to 1k (make sure you track everything needless to say). Big shakes are a foolproof and easy way to get half of your daily target calories in, the rest you can get in with big meals ie Tofu Scrambles with Sourdough, Seitan Stir Fry (or aforementioned Beyond Burgers etc)

The problem most people have is that they THINK they are eating enough, but they aren't, and they're guessing cos they don't bother tracking. Gotta quantify everything. And yeah some people think bulking is great cos you get to eat loads but it really is not easy at all but it's a part of the process that you simply can't avoid

Hopefully this helps somewhat!",

To whit, if you are setting yourself up for a gaining phase/bulk, don't feel the need to just suddenly ramp up to 3000cals and start gorging. You need to work out exactly what kind of surplus you should be in, aiming for around 300-500cals above your maintenance. For most adult men it averages at around 3000 but its dependant on a number of factors. If you end up eating too much above that surplus you'll end up putting on too much unwanted body fat (putting on a bit is inevitable but you can mitigate it by sticking to the lower end of the surplus, again 300-500)

Just start SLOWLY introducing the extra cals over a few weeks to make it easier on yourself, cos it can be an uncomfortable and arduous process. Slow and steady wins the race always!",

l6tobxm,t1_l6tmh4t,1d6ihu3,"Having a protein supplement is pretty vital especially for vegans, because hitting 180-200gms of protein daily is hard enough as it is, so while you should always aim to get as much from varied food sources (seitan, tofu, tempeh, lentils, edamame/beans, faux meats etc), it's almost essential you make up the remainder with a protein supplement. Also important we get in all essential amino acids which you will if you have a varied diet consisting of the above sources also

I will say though that a lot of vegan protein powders can be very sucky - chalky, tasteless....it'd put you off em for life. But I have found that Ghost do the very best vegan protein out there after much searching. It's kinda pricey enough but maybe it's cos I'm in Ireland but it's worth it to actually enjoy something you have to consume daily. They do lots of good flavors too (choc cereal milk, peanut Butter cereal milk are my favourites, but if you're in the US I'm sure you have a lot more options (and likely a bit cheaper)

So that's a long winded way of reppin Ghost ha! I have no affiliation btw even though this reads like an ad! 

I would also recommend getting some PB Powder. That shit is a godsend",

learning recipes you like, what foods to buy, sources of nutrition, starting to switch things out for vegan versions - is all excellent to do and will help you in the future even when you currently aren't ready to make the transition.",
ktzsz73,t1_kty9z47,1b9nsvt,"Keep in mind though, steroids may help with protein synthesis, but you have to actually get in that protein to have it be effective. If you had a low protein diet and did steroids just to sit on the couch you wouldn't magically look crazy, you still have to get the protein in for it add muscle mass.

A vegan on steroids looking just as good as a non-vegan on steroids just adds proof to the fact that eating a plant based diet provides the adequate protein content to be effective. In the fitness space this is something important to remember, too many people have something against vegans on steroids purely because they think it makes it out to be that you need them for the muscle, but in reality it just defeats the age old ""but protein tho"" argument.",

ladppmn,t1_lactkj4,1dogcus,"Routine for the past year has been mainly:
5-6 (mostly 5) days a week of lifting 

Split:
Chest/tris 
Quads/shoulders (calves too)
Back/bis 
glutes/hamstrings 

I made this split mainly bc I noticed on my “leg” days I was having a tough time really hitting quads, glutes and hamstrings the best and I thought separating them would help me grow my legs and wow has it helped!

Fav exercises:
Chest: flat bench, dumbbell incline, fly machine 
Tris- single arm cable push down, overhead dumbbell extension, either rope or bar push down 
Quads- I do a big movement to start typically hack or leg press, sometimes I’ll squat with a bar. Leg extensions and I love weighted wall sits lol
Shoulders- overhead press with bar or dumbbells, lateral raises (I always drop set) and reverse single arm delt flies 
Back- I love the single arm lat pull-down machine, I’m working on pull ups, and I sometimes will do pullovers. For rows I want to start doing barbell rows but typically I’ll do cable low rows and chest supported T-bars 
Bis- preacher curl, I drop set hammer curls with an EZ bar curl (it BURNS)
Glutes- hip thrust is my main movement for these and I do Bulgarians sometimes or abduction, adduction machine, sometimes kickbacks 
Hamstrings- RDLs are my main for these, I do lying leg curls a lot too really slowly. I don’t love seated leg curl but I do those sometimes 

I also get like 16k steps a day bc I walk a lot 

Diet I get like 150g protein in and now I’m dieting at like 1700 Cals so what I eat in a day:

Breakfast: overnight oats with sprouts strawberry protein powder 

Lunch: salad with tofu and fava bean tofu 

Dinner: edamame pasta with broccoli or 
Quinoa, lentils, black beans and another protein source like tofu, temeph, TVP

Snack: apple & pb2 (I mix pb2 with hemp powder from sprouts extra protein)
Temeph I eat like 200 Cals 22.5G protein a day of it. I love it. 

Sometimes I’ll end my night with a protein shake if I need it.",
laeh9cr,t1_lae795m,1dogcus,I am cutting now and sooo happy about it haha I do not like carrying around extra body weight. I also think eating in a deficit is just healthier all the way around for your body. I am someone who can eat so I don’t find it hard to eat the hard part was body image. But I’m a month into my cut now and already feel a lot better.,

This is the Tofu I use. It's 5 servings of 130 calories and 14g. With 5 servings you get 70g. With the sauce and rice and admittedly I'm spit balling this meal probably lands close 75-80gs.

I hope this helps.

I'll post a recipe later.",
m4815t7,t3_1hoany9,1hoany9,"Does the sauce bring it up to 70g somehow? Peanut butter and protein powder or something?

m4bhycr,t3_1hoany9,1hoany9,Fava bean tofu is virtually fat free taste about the same to me and allows you to get way more protein for a given amount of calories due to not starting with an equal number of calories from fat as soy tofu does.  It cost more than double....BUT has over 50% more protein per block.,
m4bjuyz,t3_1hoany9,1hoany9,"Recipe:

1 block of super firm tofu cubed to desired size.
Toss tofu in cornstarch with spices (white pepper, coriander, msg, powdered oregano, ginger powered) then air fry.

While air frying prepare the sauce. In a pan add:
 
2 table spoons of toasted sesame oil, 
3 tablespoons spoons of tamarind sauce, 
1 tablespoon spoon of peanut butter, 
2 tablespoons of vegan oyster sauce, 
1 table spoon of soy sauce, 
1 tea spoon of rice wine vinegar
1-2 tablespoons of maple syrup
Stir regularly for about 5 mins on medium heat.

Mix air fried and breaded tofu with sauce. The sauce will stick to the tofu.

Serve on top of rice and garnish with sesame seeds and green onion. I used dried chives because I was out.

This can be prepared in less than 20 mins and extremely delicious. A great way to get tons of protein.",

\- Cube small and marinate in soy sauce - sautee it in pan for about 3-4 mins, add stir fry veggies (sautee further together) and add your choice of stir fry sauce, serve with rice  
  
\- Crumble tofu for scrambled tofu and add blistered tomatoes, onions, and mushrooms.  I use this recipe, but use super firm and just add a tad bit more soy milk at the end:  [https://www.noracooks.com/tofu-scramble/#wprm-recipe-container-4234](https://www.noracooks.com/tofu-scramble/#wprm-recipe-container-4234)

\- Airfrying it - marinade with soy sauce, oil of choice based on cuisine, cornstarch, and your favorite seasoning.  Add it to airfryer at 400F, 10-15m based on how crispy you want it.  you will need to stir a few times, because it may stick to the pan

You can also shred it in a grater and add barbeque sauce for a pulled tofu sandwich, can serve with coleslaw mix and your favorite vegan ranch dressing",

You’re a siren, and the animals are lucky to have you on their side.  Thank you for being a fabulous ambassador!

A tip from a 56 year old vegan broad:  taking a break is healthy, but be mindful that after 45/50, it takes twice as much effort to achieve half the results.  If you’re a performer or are in the public for work, Botox will be your best friend.  When you’re around 38-40, see if you can get a CO2 laser resurfacing treatment.  Any sun damage will be addressed and by golly all your skin care products will work for you again.  I wish I had done that.  Menopause is evil and will fuck up your skin.  Please be mindful of that.",

When baking (brownies, cookies, etc.), some whole wheat flour can be replaced with soy flour. But there are also recipes where you can use kidney beans or chickpeas.

Then I eat a lot of dishes that contain tofu, seitan, kidney beans, peanut butter or lentils (for example: pad thai with tofu, red lentil dahl, broccoli and mushroom stir-fry with seitan, kidney bean and peanut butter stew). Every now and then I eat a protein bar. I rely on one or two servings of vegan protein powder a day to get 140 g of protein without consuming too many calories. 😅",😊😅

lb7htxo,t3_1dt6zgu,1dt6zgu,"38 yo, vegan 8 years 215lbs to 180 currently.
I wanted to keep up with my 8yo daughter and skateboard again so I started with walking. Love to walk, that turned into disc golf, skateboarding again and lately running. I've been in a deficit most of the year, it took me a good while to realize nuts are delicious but not super friendly for losing weight lol. 

I usually fast 20/4 on weekdays, coffee for breakfast and have a protein shake at 2pm then a big healthy dinner at 5:30pm for a 4 hour eating window. I like the light feeling of working out or running fasted nowadays. Weekends I enjoy wife's breakfast and I'll do a vegan fast food bbq bacon burger and fries once a week. 

I lift weights 3 days a week, run 3 days the last few months and skateboard on sundays. I try to walk at least a 5k with my dog everyday, sometimes we run. More than the weightloss, my perspective has changed and I'm trying new things. Realized I would love to learn to surf and cycle someday soon. If you are thinking about getting started just go out for a walk, it will be so good for your mental and could snowball into finding new passions and hobbies. Take care 🫶🌱",🫶🌱

All of it has helped my physical health, emotional regulation, appreciation for the little things, physical and mental endurance, social life and so on.

I try not to drink any calories besides a protein shake, mostly water and I'll have a diet soda with dinner.

The only thing that will help is reducing net calories (alcohol being one of them, sure) and more than you expect. I think many people would be shocked at how little food a body really needs to get by each day.

lbrp1b7,t1_lbrlknh,1dt6zgu,"Absolutely, I do coffee with a good bit of silk creamer for breakfast(150cal). My lunch shake is almond milk, Orgain protein powder, banana, chia seeds, hemp seeds, creatine, pbfit powder and lots of spinach(550cal).

That gives me a very good chance to be in a deficit, some days bigger than others depending on my workout and walk/run. I don't count my dinner calories, I eat big plates until I'm full. 

I do a homemade seitan with rice and veggies or a block of breaded tofu with veggies and beans. At least once a week I eat those two meals. I do corn tortilla tacos with beyond steak strips with rice and beans on the side on Taco Tuesdays. My other favorite weekly meal is chicken parm(2 Gardein patties, Miyoko's liquid mozzarella crisped up on top and a lot of protein pasta). 

My other meals aren't set in stone and can vary but fast food only one meal a week. I don't do candy, much bread if not necessary and try not to drink any calories besides my lunch shake. If I'm hungry before dinner I'll grab any piece of fruit. Hope this helps, let me know if you need anything!!",

I herniated a disc barbell squatting in November that took me out for a couple months so I'm trying to be easier on the body and be more creative with workouts.

I’m sure you’ve realized now, this is a lifestyle and it builds our bodies for the future. As we get older our body stops producing testosterone, which makes it harder to maintain muscle. Let’s build it up now while we can!! I’ll be 40 this year and I am almost in the best shape of my life. Loving every minute.  Best of luck bro!!",

lw0fkgb,t3_1glxyik,1glxyik,"Ive been in fitness a little while longer but I just wanted to say I relate to you on the difficulty of eating. Around 18 I weighed 170ish lbs, Im about 6,5. Trying to eat enough to not lose weight was always a bit difficult and uncomfortable. Vegan eating and the art of cooking like you’ve said does really make it more interesting and mindful and its helped me enjoy eating more and put on weight too,even though I still struggle to maintain any level of fat reserves (some of which is necessary for good health) but at least I have some weight my body can eat off of now too (200lbs). 

For whatever reason thinking of cooking like alchemy or a science makes it all the more fascinating and I just never felt that way before switching over to plant based. Its far more creative and far more feel good

Overall, Im just saying I’m with you there,its good to know I’m not alone in the discomfort of whats become standard meals; and we’ll all keep improving, but you’re making some fantastic gains as is 👌
Thanks for putting this post out there 🙏",👌🙏

Oatmeal Cookie Dough

145 grams of oats grinded into flour

1 scoop of vanilla protein powder

1 tablespoon of cacao nibs

1 cup of plant-based milk

Mix everything into a bowl, put in the fridge to chill and thicken up. The top with cinnamon, nuts, nut butter or fruit. 

Air-fried vegetables: 

Mix any vegetables of choice and tofu with my spices of choice, salt, sauce or sweetener of choice (my favorites are maple, date syrup, sriracha and soy sauce). Air fry at 400\*F for 15-20 minutes. Serve with a carb of my choice such as rice, quinoa, potatoes or pasta. Also, I LOVE to air fry a block of tofu at 425\*F for 25 minutes to get the crispiest tofu you'll ever have. 

Gluten-free cookies: 

180 grams of gluten-free flour of choice (such as buckwheat, quinoa or all-purpose)

1 cup of plant-based milk

2-3 grams of baking powder

(Optional) sweetener of choice or chopped fruit, nuts or berries

Mix everything in a bowl until you get a thick consistency. Shape them into cookies then bake at convection bake @ 375\*F for around 30 minutes. Top with nut butters, date syrup or any topping you want. 

As you can see, all of my meals are simple to make and have few ingredients so its easy for me to remember what I need! I also make sure that I have plenty of fresh fruit, dried fruit and date bars that I can snack on throughout the day. I also like making smoothie bowls, sorbets and ice creams with frozen fruit and plant-based milks. 

I eat too many different foods to list them all here, but I'm more than willing to help you create a meal plan and share some more recipes for you!",

li9xm0b,t1_li9wq3p,1eszmwi,"Haha, I dunno :P

But honestly, I actually only consume .6-.7 per lb. This may be surprising because every gym and ""personal trainer"" will tell you that you have to eat at least 1g per lb, and sure, if you're trying to get on stage, that is a good recommendation. But I'm shredded (more now than the current pic) and can do things I never thought possible with my body with calisthenics, and I don't eat anywhere CLOSE to the ReCoMmeNdeD protein!

lialcuy,t1_liajbio,1eszmwi,"Appreciate the kind word, bro!",
liarpu8,t1_liap0yb,1eszmwi,"I first fell in love with the sport, watching some of the best athletes defy gravity. Regarding starting calisthenics, the main thing is mastering the basic bodyweight movements:

* Pullup
* Dips
* Pushups
* Squats

Then, you can start moving into the more technical side of training by working on the skill progressions that interest you:

* Front and Back levers
* Planche
* Handstand
* Pistol squats

These are just a few of them, and each of them has progressions to work through before unlocking the skill. And some are easier than others to master. So, you have to consider the time to actually achieve these things.

A few YouTube channels that I can't recommend enough:

[Saturno Movement](https://www.youtube.com/@SaturnoMovement)

[Chris Heria](https://www.youtube.com/@CHRISHERIA)

[Fitness FAQs](https://www.youtube.com/@FitnessFAQs)

Those 3 channels will give you EVERYTHING you need to start.",

liem8li,t1_lidju8g,1eszmwi,"Lots of tofu, seitan (homemade), and tvp. Obviously a ton of different veggies. An ungodly amount of carbs rice and pasta mainly, haha. I typically shoot for about 120g of protein a day, but I don't sweat it too much.",
lielqgz,t1_lieezko,1eszmwi,"Really close to the beginning actually. I lost some weight from simply walking everywhere after my divorce because I didn't have a vehicle, and I was depressed and not eating. So my initial weight loss was accidental. Then I stared going to the gym and fell in love with it. First, I was into bodybuilding for about half a year or so, then fell in love with calisthenics.",
lif6mwt,t1_lif3dxg,1eszmwi,"Here's the secret that no one on social media will tell you because it's not profitable... there's no secret or ""key""

**Time + consistency = results. This is the way.**

When I first started my journey, I was militant about drinking 3-4 gallons of water, walking 12k+ steps a day, eating 1g of protein per lb of goal body weight, and tracking every calorie I ate. And honestly, this was an unsustainable lifestyle—as it is for MANY people. Did all these things help kick start my journey to shreddedness? Sure, they did.

**Here's my ""secret"" sauce for physical improvement now:**

* I eat somewhere in the range of .6-0.7g of protein per lb (if that some days)
* I don't track a single calorie (I understand portion sizes and what I'm eating after a year of militant tracking)
* I still drink around 3 gallons of water a day, but I enjoy drinking water
* I don't ever drink alcohol
* I move every day (sometimes that's 5k steps, sometimes it's 15k)
* I bodyweight strength train 2x weekly and calisthenics skills train 1x

This is a sustainable lifestyle for me and allows me to stay shredded and steadily gain muscle size and strength without restriction. An important caveat is that what works for me might not work for you or the next person.

**But there are a few things that I believe almost everyone can improve on that will with the gains:**

* Increased movement (there's no magic number, no matter what any influenzas on social media say)
* Increased water intake
* Eating more whole foods (not cutting out all the things they enjoy, just adding more nutrient-dense foods)
* Decreasing or eliminating alcohol
* Strength training 2-3x weekly



I hope that helps you on your journey!",
li9y849,t1_li9tl0s,1eszmwi,Dude!!! You ran away from the equivalent of a small child. Killing it!,
liadh8x,t1_li9xm0b,1eszmwi,"The largest systematic review on the subject says in their conclusion:

With protein supplementation, protein intakes at amounts greater than ~1.6 g/kg/day do not further contribute RET-induced gains in FFM.

For the general (light to moderately) active population I've heard the recommendation of 0.8 UpTo 1.6 per kg. 

I've been on a bit of a deep dive because I wanted to know how much protein is actually recommended because the higher recommendations just seemed so impossible to me (like 1g per lb). 

Now I feel the need to spread the word, sorry 😅.

Oh yeah, you look great! Seems like you got it figured out for sure!",😅
li9y5ay,t1_li9xm0b,1eszmwi,"Same! The recommendations are so hard to hit generally speaking. It’s like another full time job just trying to *eat* enough let alone the right things! 

I’m a firm believer that our bodies are really good at handling it and are also good and letting us know what we need (cravings) once we learn to hear and listen to them.

My workout plan is your basic push/pull/legs. 

I start my sessions out with heavy lifts in the 4-8 rep range to build strength then I move to lighter weights in the 8-20 rep range for hypertrophy/muscle growth.

Push day: heavy bench press; heavy dumbbell press; heavy skullcrushers; light chest isolation like flyes; light lateral raises; light tricep.

Pull day: heavy deadlift; heavy bicep curls; heavy rows; pullups (heh I can only do two in a row rn but once I lose strength I’ll doo negatives or partials); light bicep; light shrugs; light rows/lat pull down.

Legs: heavy squats; light calves; light Bulgarian split squats or lunges; light adductors; light abductors; light hamstring curl; light quad extensions",

m3c1di3,t1_m3ba1wa,1hjdyk7,"Oh man idk if I can go into a lot of detail.

Between June and October I was just making sure to buy less junk food and I cut my beer consumption drastically. 

Since October I’ve been drinking 1-2 times a month max. I’ve been using the Chronometer app for calorie tracking and have it set for a 1.25 lb/weight loss calorie deficit. I don’t track calories every day because I don’t have the mindset that I’m trying to reach a target weight. I have a target look and feel. Trying to lose fat. Since im building muscle mass and muscle is heavier than fat, I’m ok with going a week without losing a pound because at least I’m not gaining weight, and over the course of that week I probably put on muscle mass, even if only a tiny bit.

I just want to be leaner, like ~20% body fat, no matter the weight that gets me to.

But I’m very sedentary at the moment - working from home, have an infant so that takes up any time outside of work. It’s hard to get in minutes at the moment.

Great transformation. Keep it up!",

When I lift weights I don’t wanna eat unhealthy and drink because it is so detrimental to the gains made in the gym. I have more energy overall, and joint aches and pains are a thing of the past (except for this nagging shoulder thing that I think stems from lifting…), it seems to put me to sleep and wake me up at more reasonable hours. Self-esteem is improved bc you’re accomplishing goals each time you go to the gym *and* you just look better. 

And of course although I’m not huge nor do I want to be, it’s fun to prove to the haters that I do, indeed, get plenty of protein.

I have two mottos/goals keeping me going: 

-Anything worth doing is worth doing half-assed—better to do a miniscule something than nothing at all.

-My main fitness goal is to always lift weights, like for the rest of my life. Change might come slow but with this goal I feel a sense of accomplishment even if I do a few lunges on leg day instead of my full 7-exercise session.

Bear with me- Do you have any weights at home? If so I have a few ideas on what you could do to get started or just do *something.*, even if it adds up to under 30 minutes a week.",

m3c4uco,t1_m3adtyh,1hjdyk7,"Start with teeny tiny goals!

Day 1: squats- 3 sets of 8-20 reps with dumbbells.

Day 2: bicep curls- 3 sets of whatever reps feels doable. 8-20 reps. Dunno what weights you have.

Day 3: rest

Day 4: pushups- 3 sets of 8 - 12. Do knee pushups if this is too hard

Day 5: rest

Day 6: dumbbell rows- 3 sets of 8+ reps

Day 7: rest 


I am tempted to add more but I mean this is like under ten minutes a day as long as you make sure not to rest longer than 2 minutes between sets. If you can keep this up for a few weeks you’ll probably be itching for more. Go to YouTube and find the influencer that works for you. I like Jeff Nippard and AthleanX.",

kzwefw9,t3_1c5t5pb,1c5t5pb,"Vegans Can’t Build Muscle. 



Yep. We have all heard it before. And will definitely hear it again. Where do you get your protein? But don’t you need milk to build strong bones? My aunt’s cousin’s sister’s boyfriend's imaginary friend went vegan and they didn’t do very well. And I don’t like tofu - but I have never tried it. 



These are just a few of the silly things you might encounter as a vegan setting out on a journey to build muscle. TheBodybuilngVegan enters the chat. I am John Thomas - AKA The Bodybuilding Vegan - I have been vegan for 18 years and lifting for over 15 years. When I first entered the gym I had no clue what I was doing, and everyone there seemed to be an expert in vegan nutrition explaining how there was no way I could possibly build muscle without eating animals - or at least eggs and drinking their milk. I accepted the sad fact that I may just never be able to build muscle. But. Then something happened. By lifting weights and giving my muscles the stimulus needed to grow, alongside with getting protein from plants of all places, my muscles began to grow. It was almost as if horses, bison, gorillas, elephants and all the other giant land mammals who build impressively muscular physiques were on to something - plants have all the protein you need. 



So, where does one find plant sources of protein? I have you covered. For meat substitutes you may want to look to foods such as:



Tofu

Tempeh

Seitan

And plenty of the mock meats in stores



For isolated protein sources such as protein powders I recommend Pea Protein Isolate from TrueNutrition.com, a company I have used for the last decade. I typically get the “regular” intensity for the flavor. My current favorite flavors are banana smoothie , cookie butter, chocolate fudge and marshmallow treat. To save some money on your order  you can use my code: BodybuildingVegan https://true-nutrition.sjv.io/baOEax



True Nutrition also offers rice, soy and hemp protein powder options. 



Finally we have whole foods - if you are not a bodybuilder you don’t need excessively high levels of protein and whole foods options will have plenty for you. Some of my favorites are:



Lentils, seeds, nuts, beans, nutritional yeast and edamame to name a few. 



I have launched my YouTube Channel with workouts, nutrition and some day in the lifestyle videos. Feel free to check it out here:



[https://www.youtube.com/@BodybuildingVeganTV?sub\_confirmation=1](https://www.youtube.com/@BodybuildingVeganTV?sub_confirmation=1) 



And here is one of my favorite Tofu recipes!

Some PEDs (performance enhancing drugs) such as Growth Hormone are also vegan to my knowledge in the sense that they do not come from animals, but if they are made in a pharmaceutical grade laboratory they would have been likely tested on animals at one point in time or another. 

Most of the drugs used by bodybuilders are not pharmaceutical grade, and so would be considered ""more vegan"" by my standards. 

If you buy oral steroids I recommend getting tablets instead of capsules, as the capsules likely contain gelatin.",

I mix up some wheat meat, steam WITHOUT tin foil for 10 to 40 minutes depending on if you rip it into little pieces or if you have a giant loaf.  Then you can air fry or smash it in a hot pan.  Keep it simple. 

Add the spices you want, add the colour you want (turmeric/ketchup/blackstrap molasses) depending on the meat you’re trying to make.  Add the healthy stuff you may want (ground flax/cold pressed canola or olive oil/beans/lentils/tofu).  And just have fun with it.  

I even make turkey AND bacon out of gluten.  Add sage and time for turkey, add ketchup and liquid smoke for bacon. 

Any time brotha.",

This person has worked their ass off as a vegan bodybuilder, can stand on stage toe to toe with any carnist that says it can't be done, and all you can do is whine about steroids. It takes an insane amount of discipline, hard work, and meticulous nutrition to achieve what this person has, and even more so as a vegan.

She’s free to do as she does, especially if it makes her happy and it isn’t hurting anyone but I think u/kakanseiei’s innocuous comment is quite correct.


1.88 is the cut off. The benefits from protein don’t even increase linearly and you see minimal to barely any results from 1.6-1.8.

Even if you want the absolute max and want to hit 1.88, you’d have to be a minimum of 85kg.

If you’re anything below that, it’s a waste of money, time and energy to try and hit 165.

Id argue it’s a waste to even hit 1.88 but she seems to be doing this professionally so she likely wants all the benefits she can get.

That’s what the bibliography shows. Every study generally agrees with the above.",

Makes about 4 waffles in my mini waffle maker.

Ingredients:

1/4 cup vital wheat gluten
1/4 cup lupini flour
18g @vedgenutrition vanilla protein powder (code msmeatless)
1 tsp flaxseed meal
2 tsp water
1/2 cup, 2 tbsp almond milk
1/4 cup stevia or low cal sweetener of choice
1/2 tsp baking powder
1 tsp vanilla extract
Sprinkle of baking soda
Salt to taste

1.) Preheat your waffle maker and spray with non stick cooking oil.
2.) Make your flax egg by combining flax meal with water and let sit for 5-6 minutes.
3.) Combine all dry ingredients and mix thoroughly.
4.) Add vanilla extract and almond milk. Mix until you have a waffle batter. You can add more or less almond milk as needed but batter needs to be THICK. Thicker than a pancake batter or they will split and stick to the waffle maker.
5.) Press batter into waffle maker and cook for 2-3 min. Every waffle maker is different, so you may need more or less time!!
6.) Top with sugar free maple syrup and enjoy!!",

m4vpgrk,t1_m4tv6nc,1hqou9b,"Thank you! This will probably be a long comment because this is a very technical skill with a lot of moving parts.

I've been training for 6 years, but have been training handstands and flexibility for 2.5 years and press handstands for 1.5 years so that's how long it took me to get a stalder press.

Here are some pre-requisites for this skill:

30 second consistent handstand holds, being very comfortable with handstands and balancing in general

Full side splits and having good forward fold and pancake mobility. I talked more about how I built these here: [https://www.reddit.com/r/flexibility/comments/15s39gh/comment/jwbyb5a/?utm\_source=share&utm\_medium=web3x&utm\_name=web3xcss&utm\_term=1&utm\_content=share\_button](https://www.reddit.com/r/flexibility/comments/15s39gh/comment/jwbyb5a/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web3x&utm_name=web3xcss&utm_term=1&utm_content=share_button)

Straddle Press-to-handstand. You can build one in a lot of different ways, but I got mine through a combiniation of wall assisted reps, progressing my l-sits, v-sits and eventually working to negatives. Once I started training stalder press seriously, I started to build up more reps with my straddle press as that helped a lot with strengthening for the full movement.

I also worked a lot on my active flexibility with seated leg lifts in the straddle position (https://www.youtube.com/shorts/KKhvr4BOG0g) progressively moving my hands further towards my toes. This exercise also helped a lot with the stalder press. I also did a lot of other core work such as dragon flags and strict toes-to-bars and other exercises that strengthened my hip flexors such as bulgarian split squats. And then I did a lot of pushing exercises such as handstand pushups, pike push-ups and others.

**Stalder Press Itself**:

As for the move itself, there are 3 parts: the straddle l-sit, the transition where you move your hips above your shoulders and then the final straddle press itself.

For straddle l-sits, you will probably have to start with elevating your hands as they are brutal on your quads and hip flexors. Over time, I built up my hold times and eventually was able to do them from the floor. The seated leg raises helped a lot here.

For the transition, I did a lot of banded-assisted holds where I worked on pushing my hips up from the staddle l-sit to above my shoulders (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aLizk9sNzLs). I started with elevating my hands and using heavier bands and eventually started using lighter bands and doing them from the floor. My coach also gave me some exercises to help develop my scapular protraction such as dumbbell front raises to help me get stronger in that position as you need to round your back in order to complete the transition.

Lastly, for the full press itself, doing stalder partials, where I start with my hands in front of my feet but not completely in the straddle l-sit itself, helped a lot here. Doing stalder press negatives, where I start with a straddle press-to-handstand then lower into the straddle-l-sit helped a lot too. I also did banded full stalder presses once I was strong enough to complete the full movement.

Hopefully some of this helps! It's a very complex skill and I tried to summarize best what I did to achieve it. Let me know if you have any more questions.",

When you say 11+ years, they're probably thinking you're saying 11+ grams over the course of years knowing them lol.

m43n549,t1_m431c9l,1hnmsmr,"Hey, I hope everything is awesome your way! So right now I'm cutting and eating around 2500 cal a day with approximately 200 g of protein.

My first meal of the day is usually a shake with 40 g of vegan protein, a super green powder, 5 g of creatine monohydrate and about  6-8 ounces mixed fruit. If I want something more filling instead I'll usually do overnight oats with the protein powder and fruits or an avocado toast with a shake or a tofu scramble. Whatever combination I use I still aim to get 40 g of protein for the meal.

Then throughout the day I'll have two meals that I keep really simple, usually a protein source like tofu, I really like the fava bean based tofu by big Mountain foods, that or TVP / seitan with a carbohydrate source like rice/potatoes and mixed veg. 

After I train I'll have another shake with another 40 g of protein mixed with water. 

Then for dinner I pretty much follow the premise of the other meals making sure to get at least 40 g of protein but just change it up so it's different than anything I eat during the day. For example I could make vegan burritos with high fiber/protein wraps and so forth. I track my macros so as long as I'm hitting them I can mix & match. 

That takes me to my caloric threshold and around 200 g of protein.",

m4e860c,t1_m4e2up4,1hnmsmr,"Veganism is an ethical position that refrains from the commodification of animals. If someone were to blatantly continue using animal products, then they aren't adhering to the definition of veganism. I think it important not to reduce veganism to a 'personal choice' or be promoted under the guise of environmentalism as this is entirely contradictory to the definition which is based solely on ethics.

See, the problem is that you don't know that. How do you know they didn't change their mind? People go from doing good to doing absolutely horrible things.
