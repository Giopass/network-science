Regarding cognitive dissonance: I'm not sure if vegans are simply unaware of what it is, or are just so self-centered that they project their mindset onto everyone else. It's holding two conflicting ideas in your mind at once that cause distress because they cannot be reconciled.

They love to tell us that **we're** the ones suffering from cognitive dissonance because we aren't receptive to their long-winded predictable nonsense and just wish they would take their histrionics and go away: apparently, not feeling the need to argue and justify our food choices to their satisfaction (which will only be achieved if we stroke their starved egos, say they are right, and the only justifiable option is to be vegan) about what we eat for every meal and the fact that we find it irritating to have them blithering in our ear range is somehow an indicator that we must share their mindset and harbor a deep sense of guilt at the consumption of animals.

No, I just want to relax and enjoy my hanburger in peace, vegans. I have no interest in making every meal into a moral crisis.

I feel no guilt about eating meat and using animal products, and I suspect most of you similarly don't, either, so no, we aren't suffering under cognitive dissonance.

They think we need some profound reason that transcends our enjoyment of bacon and cheese to justify eating these things. Sorry, vegans: I love bacon and cheese, and it provides quick and easy-to-digest nutrients to my body.

Could I get the same thing by eating a strictly-plant based diet? Possibly, but it would require supplementation in order to be sufficient for my nutritional needs, and many vegans seem to suffer from depression, anxiety, brain fog, bad skin, neuropathy, and a variety of other health problems. It also puts you in a position where you have to think carefully about your diet, always be prepared (because there are plenty of situations where vegan food is unavailable), and make sure that your levels of vitamins, minerals, and protein are sufficient... and you usually have to eat a lot of food to get to that point. I am constantly amazed at how much vegans who aren't anorexic eat.

Vegans have wild imaginations: snn organization that has deluded itself into thinking it is doing ""good"" like PETA will film and film animal agriculture and wait for an outlier situation to appear. They then misinform by projecting it across all of animal agriculture, when it was some bizarre situation that arose from extremely unusual circumstances.

I don't think they even know what they want: should we just release all of the animals in agriculture despite the fact that they're dependent on us for their survival?

Also, they are guilty of anthropomorphizing animals and projecting human personalities, feelings, and reactions onto them, e.g. the artificial insemination of cows is apparently ""rape,"" but I've never seen a single cow thtat looked even mildly traumatized by the process.

Then they get the poor animals so worked up with their vegan histrionics that the animals do get actively upset by feeding off the emotions of the vegans: for example, the vegans that block the roads and chase after trucks taking animals to slaughter so that they can have a ""vegan vigil,"" where they scream and cry and try to shove their hands in through the slots to grope the animals, somehow thinking that that is exactly what the animals want.",

Vegans idea of cognitive dissonance is more of a 'your uncomfortable with me bring up this subject' they belive its cause they know its bad and they feel bad but they still want to eat meat 

It's right in aspects but wrong at the same time cause most of the time people are uncomfortable when you bring up anything off putting - especially if the conversation was forced onto you without you initiating it


I love how immediately vegans forget that they made the personal choice to become vegan as soon as they decide to be an activist - the whole ivory tower saviour mindset washes overthem and they feel the need to harrass people around them for choices they didn't make - it's radicalism 

They compare themselves to the likes of those who called for the abolition of slavery or feminists as if its similar cause they're giving something rights 

And they gloss over the arguably far larger differences between the two movements 

Mainly the fact that feminism and anti-slavery was fighting for the rights of **the same species** that were given worse treatment for arbitrary reasons

What about normal house pets? Are they not also exploited for the joy of human beings? Should they just be released into the wild or eliminated since their existence is, essentially, only for man?

And what of all the scientific studies that show plants can feel a type of pain? What should we eat then?",

They even drive prospective vegans away: it has to be all-or-nothing and there is no period of acclimation permitted despite the high learning curve that veganism has. I've seen the argument that encouraging people who, say, decide to try to be vegan three days a week should not be nurtured, because doing so is like congratulating someone who goes from kicking a dog seven times a week to only doing it four times a week.

If people here don't know the difference:

* Green water is typically rainwater and is a renewable resource.
* Blue water is water that can be easily make potable, usually taken from aquifers, rivers, reservoirs, etc. It is far less of a renewable resource than green water.

Oh, and their almond milk takes upward of 16,000 liters of blue water to grow a mere 1 kg of almonds, which is almost four times as much water that is required to grow 1 jkg of chicken, which can be done with renewable green water.

You can’t enter into a discussion assuming you know everything and it is your goal to teach/ convert the other person. You should also be willing to learn.

They lost me over the definition of veganism. For them it is a religion, not a diet. A “principle” and not a practice. As an ex-catholic (was a nun for 6 years) I have a lot of experience with the evangelical tactics of a religious person.

The goal is always conversion. It is always bringing the “truth” to someone else (assuming WE have the truth in the first place).",

It's really something new to me, but as far as the knowledge of the internet goes, I believe these suspicions might be correct. Unfortunately this will require to take a deep dive into the field of theology or in general do more bible studies I guess. What do you think ?",
m4u24si,t1_m4u1oo8,1hqg6xw,"Sounds like it might. I’d be interested to know what other books the SDA use because the Torah and the New Testament are not exactly vegan friendly. They talk about the consumption of honey, other animals products and the slaughtering and consumption of animals.

Christ refers to himself as the new lamb to be slaughtered, his body and blood consumed along with the actual Passover lamb. The Bible can be very visceral and unapologetic.

Do the SDA have ties to eastern practices such as Buddhism?",
m4z5jz2,t1_m4u24si,1hqg6xw,"That's tough one dear... I believe that it may have something that will connect the like minded people like vegans or vegetarians, but I don't know, I mean it could be linked to Buddhism, Hinduism, or something in that meaning, but personally to me it looks that it was based on one of those religions that soon evolved into ""Churches of scientology"" and stuff like ""PETA"". I was indeed trying to trace the real source of it, but what I found out was that veganism as a religion appeared very recently on the surface, mainly because they tried to prey on people who would never say no to a stranger online or on the street by using something against them that would make them feel bad about themselves that by eating meat you will go hell or something like that ya know. So yes, I could be wrong about everything I just heard, seen, or wrote, but sure as I am talking to you today, I definitely see a pattern of the con artists and the cultists alike when it comes to veganism and alike, cause it's pretty difficult to see any other way.

This solution would cause far more damage and harm than initially intended. 

In the end, it's better they are killed because dead animals aren't consuming, hungry animals.

And for your point about health, let's take Buddhism as a point of comparison. Buddhist ascetics are probably not consuming the healthiest diets or having the healthiest lifestyles when they fast and undergo extreme conditions for the sake of enlightenment. If we criticise Buddhism for spreading a worldview that makes people who participate unhealthy, that's cool, but the Buddhists would say that the good that comes from their religious aims justifies the sacrifice to their health.

Second, their numbers in the wild have exploded to the point where they are effectively an invasive species endangering other wildlife. So hunters taking these animals as game are both helping to protect the diversity of wildlife AND feeding their families in a far more carbon neutral way than somebody loading the car up with overpriced produce at Sprouts.

There are quite a number of more literally invasive species that climate scientists, conservationists, and advocates for protecting wildlife, are pleading with the general public to put on their dinner table. In some parts of the US, this includes wild boar and emu, two other delicious animals that are wreaking havoc on ecosystems.

And it's not enough to order these cuts at the butcher shop, as they may be farmed, which does nothing to help bring the problem under control. You've got to get the license, the gear, the training, and the mud on your boots. If you don't wanna do it yourself, fine, but don't criticize hunters.

This story is from 2017

First, it’s very sad Maria Strydom died

Climbing Mt Everest is extremely dangerous. Eating a vanity diet prior to ascending the mountain is an unforced error: it may have contributed to her death. However, her cause of death, altitude sickness, is not directly linked to diet

Listen, there’s a reason why **zero** vegans have ever climbed Mt Everest. I don’t recommend any vegans attempt the climb. But it’s very possible Strydom would have died *even* if she ate meat: I haven’t found any info on her climbing other major mountains. Strydom’s first major mountain climb might have actually been Everest: which was a disaster waiting to happen

No matter what, Strydom did not deserve what happened to her

Ignoring modern industrial agricultural techniques like mechanization and economies of scale, that is a good point. But hunting and gardening aren't comparable in that regard: hunting and foraging are. The comparison to gardening is home scale livestock.

>Can you demonstrate or source this claim?

Wheat isn't a high calorie food either. Wheat *seeds* are - but they're a very small proportion of the total plant. And wheat only allows you a single harvest per year on a patch of ground, and needs a lot of external inputs to maintain it. In comparison, you can seed a feed plot and harvest three times or more in a year, and rabbits will eat almost the whole plant. And given the biodiversity of things you can grow in a food plot and that you can put the manure back on the plot ground it doesn't need to lay fallow or have external fertilizer inputs, it is less harsh on the land overall.

To give some rough numbers, you can get 300 pounds of meat from a breeding pair of rabbits in a year. That's approximately 300,000 calories annually. I had a book called ""Raising Meat Rabbits"" from Britain's rationing period that suggested it takes an approximate area of 40 by 40 feet to raising one buck and three does and all their young to butchering weight by planting a mix of mangels, timothy, alfalfa, clover, and a variety of other foods to harvest throughout the year. So half that for a single pair, 20 x 40 feet, or 800 square feet of dedicated growing space. That seems about right to me, but I feed my rabbits mostly waste from other farm tasks, like weeds from weeding the garden, grass clippings from mowing paths with the scythe, kitchen scraps, so I really do very little in way of directly feeding them that I wouldn't already be doing.

There's approximately 1500 calories per pound of wheat. That means it takes 200 pounds of flour to equal the same amount of calories. An extra high yield using industrial techniques is 80 bushels per acre, or 4800 pounds. That means to grow 200 pounds of wheat takes about 1/24th of an acre, or 1,770 square feet.

I think there is a place for backyard grains, but they are intensive and hard on the land for little yield. Especially corn, that one I refuse to raise on ethical grounds.",
m83fcgm,t1_m82otcb,1i4xpw4,"From where did you get the 300 pound figure? My results suggest 100 in optimal conditions. It also seems you rounded up a couple hundred calories per pound, nearly doubling the figure. Using 100 and 600, you’re looking at more like 60,000 calories, not 300,000. That’s assuming your rationing period numbers for land use work optimally. All suggestions I see in Google or from AI say an acre or so, about 50 times as much land as you claim.

60,000 calories of wheat in a year measures 930-ish square feet (going by [these numbers](https://ourworldindata.org/grapher/land-use-kcal-poore)), or as low as 600 (according to the 4 AIs I asked) with only a single harvest.

That’s optimal versus actual, and it’s close, and that’s for wheat which isn’t the best plant for land use (so comparing best animal case to medium plant case), and it assumes your acreage requirements for rabbits are accurate which doesn’t seem right at all. Using more realistic acreage, the rabbits lose dozens of times over.

Why do you say corn is particularly bad? It has a great calorie yield per acre.",

Going off the premise that ""speciesism"" is a form of bigotry akin to racism, how does it make sense to say we're allowed to eat plants but not animals, given that plants are species as well? I guess the point of their ""Name The Trait"" argument is they'd say the ability to feel pain is a ""morally relevant trait,"" but how is pain being defined, & how is it determined that's what morally separates what we are allowed to eat vs. what we aren't? 

Vegans claim to have ""objective logic,"" & for some reason even a lot of non-vegans agree with that, but if that's true, they should be able to start from some first principle & work their way up in a deductive process that has absolutely no room for interpretation or opinion. Clearly, I don't think they do. I think it always comes down to some emotional argument that is so successful at manipulating people that even many non-vegans can't see it isn't ""objectively true.""

Though, to be fair, I think they have to do this partly because the concept of ""objective morality"" is nonsensical. I don't think the idea of moral rules as some fact that can be discovered, like a law of physics, is coherent. We make them up based on things we want to do or avoid. We want to be able to keep useful resources without fear of them being taken away, so we decide that stealing is wrong. We want to be safe, so we decide attacking people is wrong, but we also want to be able to fight back if someone breaks that rule, so we decide self-defense is an exception.

m2ukr91,t1_m2uev63,1hh6r4y,"Nuts can be a great snack, but if you truly care about the environment, you should be selective about what nuts you choose. Almonds require 10,000 - 16,000 L of freshwater to produce a mere 1 kg. Cashews come in around 4,000: the same level of chicken, and cashews exploit the most impoverished  people by hiring them to process cashews (which have toxins in the outermost two layers) without sufficient protective equipment, causing myriad health problems.

I love almonds and cashews both, but since I do care about the environment, I've reduced my almond and cashew consumption and instead upped my chicken consumption.

When people order almond milk, it makes me cringe. Oat milk and soy milk are environmentally suitable substitutes, but cashew and almond milk? They're both terrible choices.

I had a friend (who had very small breasts) and had a kid, and she said that she produced so much milk that if she didn't express before feeding her daughter, she was worried she might blow her daughter's head clear off from the pressure build up. She had a chest freezer full of containers of her milk that she didn't know what to do with and felt bad just throwing away.

She offered to give me as much as I wanted, and I will admit that I was curious, but first off, I don't really like drinking milk (unless it's in coffee, where I require it or cream... the idea of adults sitting down for dinner and drinking a big glass of milk makes my spine shiver... it's just weird), and I told her that I'd never be able to look at her the same way again if I took her up on that offer.",

I know first hand friend became vegan lives and grew up in a farming village(animal and crops) with me and stuff somehow she didn’t realize meat came from animals until she was like 35 and went crazy over it after. Most of the militant ones don’t realize about meat until they’re much older while most regular folk or moderates realize where it comes from as a kid/teen and move on. For them it’s such a late isolating experience that it causes a trauma response that is much harder to forget/move on. I went thru being vegetarian at 14 and almost Killeen myself and moved on, it’s been 4 years and she’s still not even willing to eat honey, though willing to eat and drink almond milk which is actually bad for the bees.

Add in that some vegan organizations send out slaughter and maiming videos to keep their followers on the straight and narrow so to speak and you’ve got a great mental stability for those that fall into it.

If we're so information controlled, how come I can come on here and talk to you at all? That makes no sense.

No one with half a brain actually thinks veganism even has the possibility of having this level of control over others. ""High control group"" my left buttcheek. You're sounding desperate at this point. It's so trivial to prove you wrong it's not even funny.",

If no vegan would stop you, then why can’t you do it? Is it because of the control the cult has over your mind that stops you? You may be here but you’re not listening. Even now, you try to misrepresent reasoned opposition to your cult as being akin to « a Christian fanatic ».

Yet, of the two of us, you’re the fanatic. Because as much as you tell me, and likely yourself, that you could totally choose to go out and buy meat or eggs… in reality; you can’t. Because the cult indoctrination would cause you to be so overcome by guilt.",

I'm not sure if it still exists but when I went vegan back in 2014 there was something called the 269 movement (I think) where vegans would get the number 269 branded on them with a hot iron. It was created by someone who saw a calf with that number branded on their rump so as a tribute to the calf and all exploited animals they get 269 branded or tattooed on them. 

Bite sized vegan has a video on her YouTube channel of her getting branded and her hair shaved off so she could show the world who animals are treated.

1) a T-Rex would have no concept of what its ""descendents"" are. They'd have protected their immediate offspring due to a very obvious biological drive to keep their young alive, but it's not like they'd have had any notion of ancestry whatsoever. This is ridiculous.

2) as a corollary to the first point, a T-Rex wouldn't recognize a modern day chicken as being vaguely related to it. They'd gobble them the fuck down most likely.

3) it's stupid to act like a large prehistoric predator would not only abstain from eating a prey animal on the grounds of some vague relation to said prey animal. It's utterly insane to think they'd have any concept of approval or disapproval regarding whether a different predator was doing it. The one response they're likely to have would be to try and take the food for themselves, seeing as it's currently thought they scavenged food and stole kills from other dinosaurs about as frequently as they killed their food themselves.

4) I'd absolutely eat a T-Rex if one happened to be killed in the modern world.

And one of the two meatless burger options, that vegans demonstrate their lack of dietary knowledge by treating as interchangeable, really is every bit as unhealthy as they wrongly assume all-beef hamburgers to be.

Containing more fat than a beef burger, and without the healthy monounsaturated fats found in the beef burger that, according to the American Heart Association:

>can help reduce bad cholesterol levels in your blood, which can lower your risk of heart disease and stroke. They also provide nutrients to help develop and maintain your body’s cells. Oils rich in monounsaturated fats also provide vitamin E, an important antioxidant vitamin.

To its credit, one of the other meatless burger options is loaded with monounsaturated fats, though artificially so, these being highly-processed foods unlike an all-beef burger.

And you can bet that the sources of these healthy fats would be on the chopping block, to reduce production cost, if the company producing these plant-based patties ever attained their highly unrealistic goal of replacing the meat industry.

If there is a recipe, soon there will be a cheaper recipe. And if there's a lab somewhere making it, then there will be, in time, stories about conditions there to rival the gross-out factor of reading about that Boar's Head plant that was shut down. Remember Soylent?

I did go through a painful event and started starving myself. The whole time I had anorexia I had to fight against the desire to go vegan or vegetarian. My dietician was against me going carnivore. I can tell you that the eating disorder never wanted me to eat meat. It's as if it would go for the lowest vibe if that makes sense. I'm so glad I'm not longer sick with anorexia and get to eat steaks. 

I didn't have vegan friends so I was lucky. I did it for health reasons but for animals. I love animals but don't think the way vegans do about meat.

Yeah.. that's the problem and why ozempic isn't fine... People take it to get slim without changing their exercise regimen and diet.

So when they reach their weight goal they'll stop taking it and will gain weight again.

Using only ozempic is a cheat and just a subscription to a med.

lrh2h55,t1_lrgyzhy,1g1dr3r,"You understand that the vast majority of people taking ozempic are unable to lose weight by regulating their exercise and what they eat right? 

what makes you think they'll be able to eat less and exercise more if they choose a pill instead of eating healthier and exercising more?

Edit: I've been able to stay slim even though I'm over 30 by feeling hungry every day, not because I can't afford food, or because I want to starve, but because I don't want to gain weight and the food I eat provides enough energy to compensate for the energy I burn... If I eat more, I'll gain weight... So I have to feel hungry... It's part of staying slim. 

So if you can't feel hungry, you'll need that pill for the rest of your life... It's a subscription... Not a solution.",
lrh4i1j,t1_lrh2h55,1g1dr3r,"Obviously some people will abuse it. Because some people will abuse everything. 

But ozempic can clearly help with a lot of the mental side of loosing weight. If you're not feeling constantly hungry sticking to a diet is easier. Unlearning midnight and unnecessary snacking is easier. 

It can clearly act as a sort of system reset to retrain you're body to approach food in a healthy manner, and hey, maybe some people will need to take it because the brain/stomach interface thats supposed to tell them they're full is broken.",
lrh5vxj,t1_lrh4i1j,1g1dr3r,"This is wishful thinking and isn't backed up by anything. 

The pill does not address the actual reason people gain weight, whether it's lack of education, poverty, or psychological issues. They'll still be there once the patient stops taking their subscription. 

That's what the healthcare professionals are concerned about at this moment. 

Your hypothesis can only be tested by time, we'll see in a few years how many people could stop taking it and maintain a healthy weight or not, or if they come back to the ozempic after gaining back their weight. 

I never heard your hypothesis from healthcare professionals... Which is why I said it was wishful thinking.",
lrh8fkg,t1_lrh5vxj,1g1dr3r,"Every source I've looked at: ozempic (and similar drugs that use the same main ingredient) can help a person loose weight but they won't be able to keep it off if they don't also make lifestyle changes. 

There wasn't much discussion about retraining the hunger systems, but about how in some humans the hunger systems just don't work properly and ozempic may help them manage that.

Corn itself is the largest single mono-crop in America. 40% is used for feed, 40% in the production of ethanol and alcohol and 20% for food, seed oils, etc. The animals are fed what is called corn silage which is made with the entire corn stalk and it's a way of recycling the corn we already pay farmers to grow for other uses. In other words, we pay farmers to grow corn then take the leftovers and feed it to livestock because it already exists. 

You cannot harvest a field without likely killing:   
1) Ground Nesting Birds  
2) Rodents/Voles/Etc that I guess don't count  
3) Snakes that I guess don't count  
4) Young Fawns or even old/injured deer that do count that vegans don't think about

None of this is counting the amount of death and damage done by pesticides, soil degradation due to modern farming techniques as well as damage from water runoff and erosion.   
  
All that said, the percentage X that is used for Y is irrelevant to the conversation. If you eat foods that have grains, you are eating way more death than I do with a few pieces of livestock a year. If you eat commercially harvested fruits and vegetables, you're eating way more death than I am. I don't knock Vegans. Be as vegan as you want. More power to the pursuit of better health and well being and I wish all the best health to my vegan brothers and sisters. My point is what I already said, there is no moral high ground stance for Veganism that is routed in reality.  

I'm gonna keep eating my steak and eggs, and they can keep their corn and soybeans.",
m5rbjtx,t1_m5ms6or,1htqtzw,"This is a vegan myth/misinformation. About 87% of livestock feed, about 90% for ruminants (cows) eat food not fit for human consumption. Cattle eat mostly grass grazing in fields, and bi products like stalks stems soy mash etc that are leftover waste from farming for humans that would otherwise go to waste,  for about 90% of their life.  For a short period non-grass fed cattle are fattened up in the feed lot with more grains. The actual amount of grain cattle eat compared to non-edible waste is very small.  


The grain grown for livestock feed is also not done in the same way human food is which means less impact and pesticides.

Applies both ways equally cause you never know if someone can't e.g. eat red meat cause they had a tick that fucked their system up and they just say they're vegan cause it's easier in our messed up society that doesn't take medical stuff seriously but whims like ideologies and religion are treated way too seriously, and the same goes with people who are meat eaters and you then give them some random plant foods that their gut bacteria is not used to and they will get nasty gas at best and serious or even life threatening health problems due to intolerances or allergies but they don't have an ideology or a religion to use as an excuse for idiots that understand that dietary restrictions for medical reasons are a legit thing that could seriously hurt someone to sneakily make them eat what they shouldn't

It ignores the many types of co-products of livestock animals that are used in everyday things and would have to be sourced from petroleum or something else (each alternative having its unique environmental impacts). Something else that's interesting is that even wheat grown for human consumption is not always practical for sale to the human consumption market: there could be quality issues caused by weather changes etc., contamination of mold or something else that makes it illegal to sell for human consumption, spoilage, etc.

I have Kunekune pigs, they eat mainly grass and leftovers. Each pig gets a cup of pig food twice a day. That's soy for protein, and this is optional if I feed them whole boiled eggs. 

My chickens eat insects and dropped horse grain (the one animal who actually requires grain) unless it's winter, then I feed scratch grains which is a mix of seeds and corn. This would also be optional if I started my own insect farms like meal worms, other worms, flies, etc. These are easy to do but fucking gross and I just havent gotten to it. 

Geese are heavy grazers but they'll eat grain if you have it.

About the Galapagos tortoise:
Long periods of inactivity during harsh conditions (Bonin et al. 2006; Orenstein 2012)
Make sojourns to water sources
Can go weeks or months without food or water (de Vries 1984; Bonin et al. 2006)
Water generated from metabolism of stored fat
Build up fat reserves when vegetation is plentiful
Able to survive droughts
Enables dispersal from island to island
Diet study of two Santa Cruz species (Blake et al. 2015a)
Giant Galápagos Tortoises consumed more than 60 plant species in 20 families
Seeds of many species eaten
Ate many introduced, non-native plants and seeds (Blake et al. 2015a)
May represent changes in diet since the 1930s-1950s
Human removal of native plants for agriculture began at this time
Exhibited healthier body condition
Advantage provided by elevated carapaces of saddle-backed tortoises (Blake et al. 2015a)
Thought to have evolved in order to reach Opuntia (prickly pear cactus) and other high-growing plants
Some observations of eating meat, though rare (Bonin et al. 2006)
Birds
Dead goats

We ain't no omnivorous either, all that agriculture crap is why humans started dropping like flies, that is when we evolved into homo sapiens, we were at the top of physical health during neo-paleo eras. We share the same ancestor, that's it, as it's like saying a wolf is a close relative to a domesticated dog, technically yes, but not to the actual gray wolf, the wolf dog species that went extinct a long time ago were the most recent cousins of dogs. Cats are still evolving, since they've only been domesticated for like 5000~ years or so, while dogs are 10000~ years ago.

Not that animal carcasses ever really go to waste, in a healthy biome full of wildlife to peck and gnaw at them, and biological processes that break them down and return nutrients (and carbon) to the soil.

You know what's far more difficult to break down? Cellulose, especially in the vast amounts generated by cultivation of wheat, corn, and the nuts that go into vegan milk substitutes.

Animals eaten alive constantly, pregnant mothers having their babies ripped out and eaten before their eyes, all sorts of things that sound cruel to our human morality. 

It doesn't matter if it's humans doing it or animals, the suffering is still happening. It's the way of the universe. Any morality that views this as a bad thing is naive and incompatible with the development of life on Earth. It's incoherent to view this kind of stuff as ""bad."" It's necessary. 

The only way for complex life forms to evolve is through this kind of consumption of other lifeforms, across hundreds of millions of years, multiplied by many trillions of individual animals consumed. 

Thus, the taking of a life to consume it for sustenance cannot be treated as immoral in any rational moral system. That being said, I don't believe in treating animals with unnecessary cruelty for many reasons. I try to eat only pasture-raised animals that have access to a decent quality of life. I sympathize with those who find factory farms to be cruel and seek to avoid supporting them. 

But vegan ideology as a whole doesn't make much sense, and is incapable of optimally supporting human health and well-being. If you take it to it's logical end (which nobody does), you almost get to the point of wishing for the annihilation of all life in the universe, just to prevent suffering.",

They need support, understanding and love, not hate and ignorance like the transphobic haters spread. 

Extreme veganism on the other hand brainwashes people into hurting themselves with a restrictive diet, spreading hate/toxicity and ruining relationships. I don't have anything against normal vegans that don't hate meateaters nor lie about veganism being the best diet when it comes to health.",

m1rptkq,t1_m1of0yx,1hc7lfk,"They're among the most disrespectful people I've ever encountered. I run a group on SimpleX. A group focused on cooking and sharing recipes, and stories about different recipes. It's basic AF, and all are welcome. Just a place to talk about amazing food, and share favorite recipes.

Well, there's this vegan chick who comes into the group, and starts plastering the group with these horrible pictures of animal abuse, links to vegan videos, and these rants about how horrible we all are for not adhering to her psychopathic vegan demands. So, I first ask her to stop, reminding her that this isn't a place for that sort ideological criticism. She continues on like I didn't say anything, so I kick her out. What does she do? She immediately rejoins the group using a different profile, and just continues on with her bullshit.

I spent hours kicking this girl out, and standing watch so I could kick her out over and over and over again. I've tried everything to get her to respect the rules and stop using the group as her personal anti-meat billboard. I have kicked out over 200 profiles of hers, and she just keeps coming. I tried giving her an hour to post whatever she wanted, and engage in discussions if other users wanted to entertain her nonsense. She used the time I gave her, and once her time was up, I kicked her out. Rather than appreciate what I'd done for her, she just picked back up and started coming back with new profiles.

Just, absolutely no respect or regard for others. I finally had enough and changed the group settings so that new users are automatically put on observer status, where they can see but not not speak until an admin vets them and manually makes them a full member. It seems to have finally worked, and she hasn't gotten around the new process, but it's insane that I had to go through all that.

It disturbs me that someone could be that selfish and disrespectful so relentlessly. And that same selfishness, and disregard for others is what I view as the hallmark of these vegans.",

for example in the western world during victorian times (1837 -1901) it was deemed very normal for very young (13-14 year old) girls to be married off to much older ""established"" men who could look after them without any coice in the matter.   it was infact expected of families ina societal way to conduct such marragies 

subjective morality over this issue has shifted considerably into love based marragies, the suitable age range has risen considerable, consent, and the ability to refuse. 

subjective morality has shifted with attitudes to clothing, hair styling, employment, pets, disability rights, access to medical care, homosexuality, freedom of speach, religion, rights of Man, crime and punishment, right to education .  

the list goes on. and on and on of things where what was deemed morally correct in a culture has changed dastically over time . and not always for the best (iran and afghanisatan after disasterous US  70s and 80s proxy interventionism)  

but eating meat bad. eating cute animals worse.  we got ya message recived. your talked aout it to people who activly hate your chicken shit well done.  

have a picture of a cute animal being butchered. ( pig because they are cute, playful creatures who also are really really really productive.)

incorrect. there are many people who enjoy it and also enjoy reciving it.

m143x52,t1_m11nrkw,1h9208e,"There have been plenty of civilizations currently or throughout history that do / did not think that murder is wrong. In modern day parlance, capital punishment can be viewed as state-sanctioned murder and there are many people who are for that.

I'm pretty sure that any moral you give me, I can find a society either now or in some part of history that did not view that as wrong, or that exceptions were not made in certain situations.

Dogs were not domesticated specifically to be our companions: it's a lot more complicated than that, and many animals can be domesticated to serve as companions. One would hope that you would feel bad eating **your** companion, but an anonymous animal that you don't know? In dog farms, dogs do not have an instinctive bond with humans, nor do they implicitly trust the farmers any more than cows trust the farmers. Regardless, the nature of their breeding has no relevance to whether or not they are moral to eat.

Not to be mean, but these are not compelling arguments for objective morality, nor are they compelling arguments that even in subjective morality, one should not eat dog.

Your post is rife with logical fallacies:

1. Appeal to popularity: The claim ""we all agree that murder is wrong"" assumes that widespread agreement equates to objective truth. Consensus does not necessarily make something objectively true. Slavery was at one time viewed as being perfectly legitimate by an large majority of the population (not just in the US). I hope that you wouldn't state that that justifies slavery as objectively moral.

2. Strawman argument: The claim that moral relativists need to reject statements like ""torturing people for fun is wrong"" oversimplifies and misrepresents moral relativism. Moral relativism does not inherently condone harmful actions but rather emphasizes that morality is culturally and subjectively constructed.

3. Appeal to nature: Because something is natural (dogs being bred as companions), it is a ""moral good"" not to eat them. That is more specific example of a non sequitur.

4. Moral superiority / cultural chauvinism / unsupported assertions: ""...it’s a poor choice made exclusively by inferior cultures."" There are cultures that do eat dog, where it is or has been quite popular. You're denigrating entire cultures (not a good look on anyone) without any valid moral reasoning except for your circular arguments.

5. False dichotomy: Eating dogs is bad unless it is absolutely essential. There aren't just two choices here.

  
7. Red herring: Introducing unrelated moral assumptions that you haven't established as true (murder is wrong, compassion is a virtue) and lump eating dogs in the same category, which again is also a non sequitur.

8. Argument for tradition: Lens on history which does nothing to support your argument.

Since you fail to prove moral objectivity, the rest of your argument is moot. If moral objectivity existed, then humans wouldn't bicker endlessly about morality: we would have clear knowledge of such a moral objectivity, which we don't.",

Eating companion animals is objectively immoral, get this through your head. 

>I've actually been to all those countries you listed,

So have I. And China and Vietnam were definitely shit. South Korea was just a little above mediocre but still not a great country.  And even in those countries, many people support ban against dog meat. No, this is not vegan activism. Eating cats and dogs is definitely beyond veganism and it is horrible.

A decade of ideological entrenchment, and yet still baffled by the idea that a cardiologist—someone well-versed in actual human physiology—might prefer beef, one of the most nutrient-dense foods on the planet. Shall we take a moment to marvel at the irony? While vegans preach their gospel of kale and quinoa, this cardiologist likely understands what so many plant-based devotees choose to ignore: red meat provides bioavailable iron, B12, zinc, high-quality protein, and essential fatty acids—nutrients that the human body requires for optimal function.

Perhaps what's truly “bizarre” here is not that a doctor eats beef, but that there are people who believe a diet devoid of these critical nutrients is superior.

lo3o5ro,t1_lo2l5k5,1flehvy,"> Genuinely curious, how did it go? What is it exactly?

Alcohol was banned in the US for 13 years because of the temperance movement, a religious movement who felt that drinking was immoral and piggybacked that on real but minor health and social concerns.

How it went is that it was overturned after 13 years, and the movement itself caused a MASSIVE explosion in the alcohol industry.  Most modern drinks, as well as the quality and availability of bourbon and rye whiskeys, directly tie back to prohibition and the temperance movement.",
lo4sdge,t1_lo2l5k5,1flehvy,"Temperance started as a movement against the drinking of alcohol, largely for religious reasons. It was believed that drinking caused moral decay in people. In the late 18th, early 19th centuries, people drank quite a bit because water was often polluted. However, most people didn't drink to excess, and drunkenness was frowned upon. One of the things all 13 Colonies had in common was a love of hard cider. Alcohol was prolific and some people had a problem with it. 

Temperance started as merely advocating for drinking in moderation but it morphed into abstaining from alcohol entirely. It picked up steam and became political by the mid 1800s. States started enacting laws that prohibited the sale of alcohol or limited it.

This continued until the end of WWI when the Volstead Act was passed and alcohol was made illegal in 1919. The entire 1920s and early 1930s was marked by Prohibition, in which organized crime surged because there was so much money to be made in bootlegging, so the moral virtue of pushing teetotalism on people lead to more people getting killed and hurt than alcohol ever caused because of all the organized crime.

So the lesson here is trying to legislate moralism is doomed to failure.",

lo4udkn,t1_lo39ut3,1flehvy,And it was so huge in the early 1900s that they actually got alcohol completely banned in the U.S. read about Prohibition,
lo5j3c0,t1_lo5hjrk,1flehvy,"Actually, no. That happened later.

The legal drinking age used to vary by state. In the 1970s there were a ton of drunk driving fatalities by young people. As many as 60% of all vehicular fatalities were alcohol related, and many of them were teenagers. It was common for teenagers who were underaged to cross state lines into states with a lower age requirement so the age was raised to 21 in 1984 to curtail this.",

Sadly my doctors have told me that this is most likely a genetic and malabsorption issue on top of just dietary stuff, so the supplements are necessary because diet alone won’t fix it (although a primarily meat based diet has shown to help with symptoms in newer studies, more research is needed though).

I currently subsist on 5000IU of Vitamin D, and 5000Mcg of B12 and B1. The vitamin D can go up to a prescription 10,000IU weekly if the 5000IU does not cause my levels to improve (which has happened before)

Just for reference the scientists at the North Pole have to take 50,000IU monthly for 6 months of the year because they get no sunlight, I could end up having to take a 1/5th of that just to get my levels to budge from “extremely low”

I do remember that sometimes people can't deal with antihistamines in aged meat, so try smoked, steamed, dried, boiled, cooked beef, pork or any red meat in general to see if you feel better afterwards, though I am not sure if it's that bad if its true, but it could be just an intolerance just like lactose or eggs. Try to take a blood test to find out which food you are allergic too, trust me it will save you a lot of trouble, as allergies of any kind can be really life threatening, and you won't be able to feel or see it outside your body since allergens like gluten can make your body identify it as a threat and make scar on your intestine, thus possibly leading a to very dangerous infection.

The beef most likely is a MCAS sensitivity now that I think about it, as allergies to meat are extremely rare. I’m also thinking of adding lamb to my diet since it’s also a red meat and I may be able to tolerate it better, but the only way to find out is through actually trying it.",

And, at least in my case, even if it were to heal its healing with scar tissue, so it’s the equivalent of wrapping electrical tape around a dying charging cord. It may work okay, but not as well as the original plastic coating from the factory.

My lesions have healed somewhat, I can confirm that, and honestly maybe the copious amounts of Kerrygold I slather onto my steamed veggies may have something to do with that. I know research is being done into high protein diets and people have reported better symptom improvement from eating more meat (which ironically, was the exact opposite thing people were doing for decades, if you wanna see the torture some people put themselves through just look up the “Whals protocol for MS” it looks good on the surface but it emphasized all the wrong things (focus on veggies and fruits, which were limited, and iirc no animal products and only certain cuts of meat, basically extremely restrictive Mediterranean diet, also no supplements or medication to help the disease, so there were most likely malabsorption issues”  . It’s up there with “veganism cures cancer”",

m7hcilz,t1_m7epab4,1hv03b3,"I should probably clarify that statement is kinda tongue-in-cheek. I was basically saying if the animal fats I consume have helped in someway so be it.

I don’t attribute my recovery entirely to my diet, but I do know the far and few studies on eating animal products have shown a net positive for people with MS and at the very least healing",
m7ldmdg,t1_m7hcilz,1hv03b3,"I see. I do remember however on how caffeine in teas and coffees seemed to improve the cognitive function in people with various disorders including Alzheimer's. Yes, you are correct, your brain is made up of like 70%~ fat, so I'd say that animal fat is a must, not a ""should you eat that"" kind of thing. 
I do remember that also animal fat ( I think it was D3, I might be wrong though) is necessary to heal the wounds, as there is something in those animal fats that is still just necessary as animal protein to make your wounds heal properly, it could be that as well. I think the same thing is with probiotics found in dairy, especially in fermented products such as sour cream or Greek yogurt.",

m7u8xpk,t1_m7senyh,1hv03b3,"No, I’ve just spend years researching nutrition and health because of circumstances (I will be quite blunt and say I am fat/ exist in a larger body, I’ve done a lot of dieting from teenage years onward and that plus the incompetent doctors and the metabolic syndrome I have is what lead to my Atypical Anorexia.). I also have a dietitian I see regularly and I absorb this information like a sponge. I’m also friends with a lot of people in med school currently as well as medical research fields involving things like cancer genetics and the like, so it leads to being able to have conversations with the up-and-comers and getting some insights by seeing how they think.

I’ve been told by medical professionals that I just understand research papers really well. I can parrot off a lot of technical terms and new research to them correctly and it sometimes shocks them I’m not going into medicine myself. I’m just the type, because of my medical trauma and shit-end-of-the-stick to want to understand exactly what they are suggesting as treatment modalities and how it works and what it’s doing to my body. Medical literature and research was also just a special interest of mine when I was younger. I think it’s cool we can see actual scientific discoveries happening within the medical field in real time. 

Most doctors outside of dietitians only get approx. 7 hours of nutrition training through their entire graduate program. 7 hours of training that doesn’t tell them that nutritional science is loose assumptions at best (and conflict-of-interest riddled garbage fires at worst) because we’re all different and don’t know a one and done solution to nutrition (and especially weight management) yet. Also the science hasn’t proven anything over more than a two year period when it comes to weight loss, and most participants drop out throughout these studies because of shame should the proposed diet cause issues or not work long term and cause regain. It’s scary how qualified doctors that aren’t dietician’s feel on giving out nutrition advice when you know this.",

I am so sorry to hear that.🐺🙏
Doctors should not get involved in one's diets so much, doctors can only treat, diagnose and prescribe, that's pretty much it, but knowing about the nutrition ? It's an entirely different spectrum if you ask me, each person should get the qualified and verified information online and not some kind of loose end studies that ends up as aropaganda.

One thing I have observed from their posting history on social media is that a disproportionate number have mental issues like bipolar, clinical depression, etc. I think this all ties together.

1. because the vegan diet is currently not the norm, you have to come out if you want it to be respected in a group - it's the same as allergies and you are often asked why you are not meat now

2. the vegan way of life often comes about through experiences or certain images that show the conditions in factory farming. This is often accompanied by an enormous emotional burden, which leads to the person trying to do something about it and to slobber on others. This can of course be frustrating and these discussions are rarely objective from either side.

Some families believe that foods labeled as natural are the most healthy and an appropriate nutritional choice. However, their composition does not respect European recommendations. They are always hypocaloric and protein, vitamin, and mineral concentrations are inadequate. The aim of this study was to report severe nutritional complications after inappropriate plant milk consumption. Between 2008 and 2011, we studied severe nutritional deficiencies caused by consumption of plant milks bought in health food stores or online shops. Infants were identified in our centers and examined through medical history, physical examination, and laboratory testing. Nine cases of infants aged from 4 to 14 months were observed. In all cases, these milks were used as an alternative to milk formulas for supposed cow's milk allergy. At diagnosis, four patients were aged 6 months or less. They had received plant milk exclusively for 1-3 months. The beverages consumed were rice, soya, almond and sweet chestnut milks. In three cases, infants presented __severe protein-calorie malnutrition__ with __substantial hypoalbuminemia__ (<20 g/L) and __diffuse edema__. In the other cases, the nutritional disorders were revealed by a refractory __status epilepticus__ related to __severe hypocalcemia__ (one case), __growth arrest__ of both height and weight secondary to __insufficient caloric intake__ (five cases), and __severe cutaneous involvement__ (one case). Five children had __severe iron deficiency anemia__ (<70 g/L), three children had a __very low 25-hydroxy vitamin D level__ (nutritional rickets), and two had __severe hyponatremia__ (<130 mmoL/L). Milk alternative beverages expose infants to __severe nutritional deficiencies__. Serious complications can occur. Early, exclusive, and extended use is riskier. These diseases are preventable, and parental education should be provided. Statutory measures forbidding their use in young infants should be organized to slow down the progress of this social trend."" - [""Severe nutritional deficiencies in young infants with inappropriate plant milk consumption"" (2014)](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/24726668/)

* ""Severe nutritional disorders, including kwashiorkor, marasmus, and rickets, were seen in four children and were due to parental food faddism, which should perhaps be regarded as a form of child abuse. All disorders were corrected with more normal diets and vitamin supplements.

  In view of the potentially serious consequences of restrictive diets being fed to children, families at risk should be identified and acceptable nutritional advice given. When children are found to be suffering from undernutrition due to parental food faddism a court order will normally be a necessary step in providing adequate treatment and supervision."" - [""Malnutrition in infants receiving cult diets: a form of child abuse.""

lua3ku6,t3_1gcrbor,1gcrbor,"That's true, my ex wife is vegan, and according her story, she was brainwashed when she was teenagers (around 13-15 years old) by ""**YiGuan Dao**"" aka ""Maitreya"" cult. This cult plays video of dairy animal torturing before being eaten during their worship day. Fortunately, I can enjoy these torturing video when I eat my non-vegan food LoL.

This cult also brainwashes the believers with cruel vow that they agree to die and go to Hell if they don't eat vegan. Or if they support non-vegan food, or buy non-vegan food for other people, no matter what.

And another false thing about this cult is they claimed that Jesus and Mohammed entrusted the followers to their Maitreya god, or entity called ""Mother"" (Lao Mu) with the mantra ""**Wu Tai Fo Mi Le**"" in which this is blasphemy for Abrahamic religions. Yes, they also have Jesus, Mary, Mohammed, and Moses statues in some of their temples.",
l63vtr6,t3_1d2z0qt,1d2z0qt,"i'm patiently waiting for vegans to stop being hypocritical and only buy wind pollinated grass. it's interesting to me how they are fine with commercialized pollination. 

i think vegans have such a high level of cognitive dissonance that they don't even realize their own hypocrisy. it seems like the only thing vegans have contributed is an increase in visits to doctors and dietary specialists to treat negative health outcomes from their vegan diet",

l6lr7dy,t3_1d2z0qt,1d2z0qt,"Hah, this one actually made me laugh. Veganism is a purely modern invention.

The most famous person I can think of in ancient times is Seneca, who stopped eating meat briefly (aka was a vegetarian or maybe pescetarian). People thought it was so weird, he resumed.

Apart from Hindu ascetics and those kind of people - who, again, probably weren't *vegan* per se, they were most likely vegetarians who didn't have access to cattle only because they lived in the forests, so most of their diet was plant based by... y'know, necessity.",
