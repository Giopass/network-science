m768324,t1_m72jd1o,1hzb4do,"OK Relax. It‚Äôs a phrase. Yes, by virtue of just being alive, no matter how low impact we try to be, critters are going to die in the process. Just walking down the street, we likely step on and kill multitudes of ants, aphids, and other little insects. I got stung by a bee the other day and obviously the bee died. I suppose if we all just opt to die, then we will truly be cruelty free. I have no interest in dying at this point in my life. 

I do however have an interest in living as low impact at possible. To me this means walking or using transit wherever possible, buying locally sourced foods and other products where possible, living minimally, and not eating or using any animal product. This isnt me attempting to be righteous or virtuous, it‚Äôs just what keeps me going. 

You do understand that a meat eating diet kills far more animals as well I hope. The amount of grain that is needed to feed a cow, pig, or chicken to produce 1000 calories of meat is anywhere from 6 to 9 times more than the amount of land required to produce 1000 calories of just crops. So that‚Äôs 6-9 times more field mice, deer, birds, and other critters killed in the production of food stuffs for livestock than for a human that just ops to eat only crops. This isn‚Äôt to mention the livestock that is being slaughtered, and  mind the insane water usage. 

So no, the fact that even the most staunch vegan is going to kill animals as a byproduct of their existance hasn‚Äôt escaped me. But what has seemed to escape you is that the cruelty and environmental impact of a vegan is going to be far less than that of a meat eater. But I digress, perhaps the phase should be cruelty-light.",

And that reason mostly rests upon the fact that plants lack a central nervous system, currently scientifically agreed upon to be required for sentience, and only merely **chemically** reacting to stimuli as opposed to the **existentially subjective and mostly mental** reactions that sentience involves. Not much different from bacteria or even a computer.

In this regard, an animal's sentience is several degrees more relevant than a plant's unconfirmed, scientifically heterogenous, and **arguably pseudoscientific** SUPPOSED ""sentience"". That's why they got called a doofus.",

m6t8udy,t1_m6t8awq,1hzb4do,"I already explained it. A **confirmation of harm** (animal sentience) is more important to worry about than a mere *teensy possibility* of harm (plant ""sentience"", which is only a mere concept so far). If you **have** to choose one or the other in order to stay alive, you choose the tiny possibility over the confirmation. Basic logic.",

Just tried this recipe. Thanks for posting.The beetroot made mine a vivid red.  I'd like to note the place where i went wrong.

I substituted the cashew for sunflower seeds (allergies), which i don't recommend. The sunflower flavor is stronger than i thought it would be. I also have found that my blender sucks so it came out a bit gritty. Next time i'll try tofu like you mentioned in another comment.",

Ingredients:

For the Ravioli Dough:

- 300g all-purpose flour
- 100g semolina flour
- 1 tsp salt
- 200ml warm water
- 2 tbsp olive oil

For the Ravioli Filling:

- 200g firm tofu, crumbled
- 2 tbsp nutritional yeast
- 1 clove garlic, minced
- 1 tbsp lemon juice
- Salt and black pepper, to taste

For the Roasted Red Pepper Sauce:

- 3 large red bell peppers
- 2 tbsp olive oil
- 1 medium onion, finely chopped
- 3 cloves garlic, minced
- 200ml vegan cream cheese
- 1 tbsp nutritional yeast
- 1 tsp smoked paprika
- 1 tsp dried oregano
- Salt and freshly ground black pepper, to taste
- 1 tsp lemon juice

For Garnish:

- Fresh basil leaves, chopped

Method:

1. Preheat your oven to 200¬∞C. Cut the red bell peppers in half and remove the seeds and membranes. Place them on a baking tray lined with parchment paper, cut side down. Roast for 20-25 minutes, or until the skin is charred and blistered. Once roasted, place the peppers in a bowl and cover with cling film for 10 minutes to steam. Peel off the skin and set the roasted peppers aside.

2. In a large frying pan, heat 1 tablespoon of olive oil over medium heat. Add the chopped onion and saut√© for 5-6 minutes until softened and translucent. Stir in the minced garlic and cook for another 1-2 minutes until fragrant.

3. Add the roasted red peppers to a blender, along with the saut√©ed onion and garlic. Spoon in the vegan cream cheese, nutritional yeast, smoked paprika, and dried oregano. Blend until the mixture is smooth and creamy. Season with salt, black pepper, and lemon juice to taste.

4. To make the ravioli dough, combine the all-purpose flour, semolina flour, and salt in a large bowl. Make a well in the centre and add the warm water and olive oil. Mix until a dough forms, then knead on a floured surface for 8-10 minutes until smooth and elastic. Wrap in cling film and let it rest for 20 minutes.

5. While the dough is resting, prepare the filling. In a medium bowl, combine the crumbled tofu, nutritional yeast, minced garlic, lemon juice, salt, and black pepper. Mix well until evenly combined.

6. Once the dough has rested, divide it into two equal portions. Roll each portion out on a floured surface until it is very thin (about 2mm thick). Place small spoonfuls of the filling, about 4cm apart, on one sheet of the rolled dough. Place the second sheet of dough over the top, pressing around each mound of filling to seal. Use a knife or ravioli cutter to cut out individual ravioli pieces, ensuring the edges are sealed well.

7. Bring a large pot of salted water to a boil. Cook the ravioli in batches for 3-4 minutes, or until they float to the surface. Drain and set aside.

8. Pour the blended roasted red pepper sauce back into the frying pan and warm it over low heat. Add the cooked ravioli to the sauce, gently tossing to coat each piece in the creamy sauce.

9. Divide the creamy ravioli between four bowls. Garnish with chopped fresh basil leaves for a burst of colour and flavour.",

As a head of marketing, I know you're doing that to generate traffic to your website where you get ad revenue, but I think you'd get more results in the long run by showcasing the ingredients in the videos and tell people to go to the blog to know more. Your videos would bring more value themselves rather than only being a tool to generate traffic. I could be wrong though. If your way works better, I'm probably just not your target audience...

* 4 large potatoes
* 2 tbsp olive oil
* Generous amount of sea salt & freshly cracked black pepper
* 1/2 tsp smoked paprika
* 1/2 tsp garlic powder
* 1/2 tsp onion powder
* 1/2 tsp oregano
* 1/2 tsp dried rosemary
* Fresh parsley to serve

###Instructions

1. Preheat your oven to 200¬∞C fan forced. Peel your potatoes, then slice off the tops and bottoms followed by the sides to create flat edges. Slice down lengthways to create 3 even thick pieces.
2. Place between a pair of wooden chopsticks and slice vertically. Flip then slice diagonally. Repeat with all the potato slices then place onto a lined baking tray.
3. In a small bowl, mix together the salt, pepper, paprika, garlic powder, onion powder, oregano and rosemary.
4. Brush oil mixture over the potatoes to evenly coat each slice then bake in the oven for 25-30 minutes. Flip and bake for another 15 minutes or until golden and crispy.
5. Transfer to a plate and garnish with fresh parsley. Enjoy immediately while hot and crispy!

m5dujlp,t3_1htjug6,1htjug6,"[Full recipe available here](https://www.plantifulpalate.com/post/homemade-vegan-gnocchi)

Ingredients:

For the Gnocchi:
- 1kg potatoes (e.g., Maris Piper)
- 200g plain flour, plus extra for dusting
- 1 tsp salt

For the Tomato Sauce:
- 2 tbsp olive oil
- 1 large onion, finely chopped
- 3 garlic cloves, minced
- 1 tsp ground cumin
- 1 tsp smoked paprika
- 1/2 tsp chilli flakes (optional)
- 400g canned chopped tomatoes
- 2 tbsp tomato pur√©e
- 1 tsp sugar (optional, to balance acidity)
- Salt and freshly ground black pepper, to taste

For the Plant-Based Cream:
- 150g unsweetened plant-based yoghurt (e.g., coconut or soy)
- 1 tsp lemon juice
- 1/4 tsp garlic powder
- Pinch of salt

For Garnish:
- 2 tbsp fresh parsley, chopped
- Freshly ground black pepper

Method:

1. To make the gnocchi, start by peeling the potatoes using a vegetable peeler. Rinse them under cold water to remove any residual starch. Place the peeled potatoes in a large pot and cover with cold, salted water. Bring to a boil and cook for 15-20 minutes, or until the potatoes are fork-tender but not falling apart. Drain the potatoes and let them sit for a few minutes to release excess steam. Mash the potatoes using a potato ricer or masher until completely smooth, ensuring there are no lumps. Allow them to cool slightly. Gradually mix the flour and salt into the mashed potatoes, adding a little at a time, until a soft dough forms. Knead the mixture gently until it forms a soft dough. Avoid overworking the dough to keep the gnocchi light and fluffy.

2. Divide the dough into four portions. Roll each portion into a long rope about 2cm in diameter, then cut into 2cm pieces. For a classic gnocchi texture, press each piece gently with the back of a fork to create ridges. Dust with a little flour to prevent sticking.

3. Bring a large pot of salted water to a boil. Add the gnocchi in batches and cook until they float to the surface, about 2-3 minutes. Remove with a slotted spoon and set aside.

4. For the tomato sauce, heat olive oil in a large frying pan over medium heat. Add the chopped onion and saut√© for 6-8 minutes until softened and translucent. Stir in the minced garlic and cook for an additional 1-2 minutes until fragrant.

5. Add the ground cumin, smoked paprika, and chilli flakes (if using) to the pan, stirring to coat the onion mixture. Cook for 30 seconds to release the spices‚Äô aromas.

6. Stir in the canned tomatoes, tomato pur√©e, and sugar (if needed). Season with salt and black pepper. Simmer the sauce over medium heat for 10-12 minutes, stirring occasionally, until it thickens slightly and the flavours meld together.

7. While the sauce simmers, prepare the plant-based cream by whisking together the yoghurt, lemon juice, garlic powder, and a pinch of salt in a small bowl. Set aside.

8. Add the cooked gnocchi to the tomato sauce, stirring gently to coat them evenly. Simmer for an additional 2-3 minutes to warm through.

9. Transfer the gnocchi and sauce to serving bowls. Add dollops of the plant-based cream on top and garnish with fresh parsley, a drizzle of extra virgin olive oil and a generous sprinkle of freshly ground black pepper.

10. Serve warm and enjoy!",

MEAT FILLING:
* 2 tablespoons olive oil
* 1 cup chopped yellow onion
* 1 lb. Impossible meat 
* 2 teaspoons dried parsley leaves
* 1 teaspoon dried rosemary leaves
* 1 teaspoon dried thyme leaves
* 1/2 teaspoon salt
* 1/2 teaspoon ground black pepper
* 1/2 tablespoon soy sauce 
* 2 garlic cloves -minced
* 2 tablespoons all purpose flour
* 2 tablespoons tomato paste
* 1 cup water or vegetable broth 
* 1 cup frozen mixed peas & carrots*
* 1/2 cup frozen corn kernels

POTATO TOPPING:

* 1 ¬Ω - 2 lb. russet potatoes -about 2 large potatoes peeled and cut into 1 inch cubes
* 8 tablespoons unsalted butter -1 stick
* 1/3 cup creamy non dairy milk 
* 1/2 teaspoon garlic powder
* 1/2 teaspoon salt
* 1/4 teaspoon ground black pepper
* 1/4 tofutti sour cream 

MAKE THE MEAT FILLING.
* Add the oil to a large skillet and place it over medium-high heat for 2 minutes. Add the onions. Cook 5 minutes, stirring occasionally.
* Add the ground impossible beef to the skillet and break it apart with a wooden spoon. Add the parsley, rosemary, thyme, salt, and pepper. Stir well. Cook for 6-8 minutes, until the meat is browned, stirring occasionally.
* Add the soy sauce and garlic. Stir to combine. Cook for 1 minute.
* Add the flour and tomato paste. Stir until well incorporated and no clumps of tomato paste remain.
* Add the broth (or water), frozen peas and carrots, and frozen corn. Bring the liquid to a boil then reduce to simmer. Simmer for 5 minutes, stirring occasionally.
* Set the meat mixture aside. Preheat oven to 400 degrees F.
MAKE THE POTATO TOPPING.
* Place the potatoes in a large pot. Cover the potatoes with water. Bring the water to a boil. Reduce to a simmer. Cook until potatoes are fork tender, 10-15 minutes.
* Drain the potatoes in a colander. Return the potatoes to the hot pot. Let the potatoes cook a bit for minute or two to evaporate any remaining liquid.
* Add vegan butter, milk, garlic powder, salt, and pepper. Mash the potatoes and stir until all the ingredients are mixed together.
ASSEMBLE THE CASSEROLE.
* Pour the impossible meat mixture into a baking dish. Spread it out into an even layer. Spoon the mashed potatoes on top of the impossible meat. Carefully spread into an even layer.
* If the baking dish looks very full, place it on a rimmed baking sheet so that the filling doesn‚Äôt bubble over into your oven. Bake uncovered for 25-30 minutes. Cool for 15 minutes before serving.",

There are big companies who have to provide veggy products or they'd go under. most employees i spoke to said transition is fine though, they are just raking it in with those products because it's even more overprocessed massproduced shit, than the regular meat stuff ever would have been. 
The regular meat comes from the slaughterhouse in the next city, grain fed beef - grown in the next city (literally for the company i have in mind).

No offence but the bar to become a chef is so low that this doesn't really make you sound as knowledgeable as you think it does. Working in kitchens when I was a student was a real eye opener, and a lot of the stereotypes aren't as far from the truth as I thought they would have been. 

> Maybe read less and talk to people i guess?

Ah, the foundation of knowledge. Ever heard of JBS or Tyson Foods? Let's not pretend all meat comes from the next city everywhere. Even if it did, you might want to look up why cattle rearing is bad for the environment no matter how far from the kitchen it is reared. Emissions and land use not that great, you know. Fake meats might not be all that healthful (no worse than beef...) but at least they don't burp methane.

lc17hdt,t3_1dxfrdb,1dxfrdb,"###Ingredients

* 1/2 an onion, finely chopped
* 5 cloves garlic, crushed
* 1 tbsp tomato puree
* 3-4 large tomatoes, chopped
* 2 x 400g tins of butterbeans
* Small handful of torn fresh basil
* 250g firm tofu - Tomato flavored shown in the gif, but if you can‚Äôt find this, just use firm tofu and add a bit more tomato puree and salt
* 3 heaped tbsp nooch
* 2 tbsp white miso
* Splash of water

**To serve**

* More fresh basil
* Extra virgin olive oil
* Toasted sourdough bread or cooked grain of choice

###Instructions

1. Saut√© the onions in plenty of olive oil and a pinch of salt for 8 mins. Add garlic and fry three mins more, then add tomato puree, the chopped fresh tomatoes and a big pinch of salt.

1. Bring to the boil, then bubble and simmer for 5-6 mins. Add the beans + their juices from the can (I pour a little out of the top first) and the basil, reserving a little for garnish. Bubble for a further 5 mins.

1. Scoop out 2 spoonfuls and blend with the firm tofu (I use a tomato flavored one but if you can‚Äôt find this, add a little more tomato puree and salt) the nooch, and the miso. Add a splash or two of water to help it blend to a smooth consistency, season to taste. (Tip the tomatoey tofu cream into the beans, mix and gently heat.)

1. Serve with olive oil, black pepper and enjoy with a slice of sourdough bread.

* Panko 150g
* Garlic 2 Heads
* Fresh Chili 20g
* Salt 1 tsp
* Soy Sauce 2 tbsp
* Sesame 1 tbsp
* Scallion 3 Stalks
* Oil

###Instructions

1. Cut tofu into cubes(about 2cm*2cm), first dip the tofu in sparkling water, coat it in corn starch, then dip it in sparkling water again and coat the tofu again in panko. Chop the garlic, chili and scallion into small pieces.
2. Heat up the wok(medium heat), when it‚Äôs hot enough add oil, add tofu, pan-fry until all sides are golden and crispy, then take it out. The tofu might stick together because of the starch, separate them carefully with spatula or chopsticks while pan frying.
3. Add garlic to the wok(medium-high heat), stir for 30s then add the chili, stir for another 30s, add tofu, then add salt and soy sauce
4. Mix quickly and sprinkle the sesame and scallion on top

m3qhjh9,t3_1hm1c16,1hm1c16,"###Ingredients

* Avocado oil and spray for baking
* 1, 16 oz package super firm tofu or extra firm tofu (if using extra firm press for 15 minutes before using)
* 2 tbsp tamari
* Juice and zest 1/2 a lemon
* 1/3 cup cornstarch or all-purpose flour
* 1/2 cup soy or almond milk
* 1 tsp apple cider vinegar
* 1 tsp fresh thyme leaves (about thyme 5 sprigs)
* 6 sage leaves
* 2 inch sprig of rosemary
* 1/2 cup panko breadcrumbs
* 1/4 cup nutritional yeast
* 1 tsp garlic powder
* 1/2 tsp paprika
* 1/2 tsp kosher salt and more to taste

**To Serve**

* Your favorite gravy (Mushroom gravy shown in gif)

###Instructions

1. Preheat the oven to 425F. Prepare a quarter sheet pan by brushing with 1-2 tbsp of oil to coat the bottom of the pan then set aside.

1. Cut your tofu block into 3-4 slabs lengthwise. Place the slabs in a resealable freezer bag or an airtight container with the tamari and lemon juice. Seal the container and gently shake to coat and set aside to marinate for at least 10 minutes.

1. Set up three shallow bowls. To one bowl add the cornstarch. To the second bowl add the milk and vinegar. Let it sit for 2-3 minutes, add a pinch of salt then whisk together.

1. Place the thyme, sage, and rosemary on a cutting board then finely mince with a knife. Add the minced herbs to the last bowl along with the breadcrumbs, nutritional yeast, lemon zest, garlic powder, paprika, and 1/2 tsp of salt.

1. Using one hand for wet ingredients and the other for dry ingredients, coat the slab of marinated tofu in cornstarch. Dip the coated tofu into the milk mixture then transfer to the bowl of seasoned breadcrumbs making sure the tofu is completely coated.

1. Transfer the breaded tofu to the baking tray and spray the tops of the tofu slabs with a little oil. Bake the tofu for 15 minutes, then flip and bake for an additional 5-10 minutes until golden. Slice and serve the tofu as desired and enjoy.

Recipe:
Ingredients:

For the cauliflower wings:
  - 1 medium cauliflower, cut into florets
  - 1 cup plain flour
  - 1 cup water
  - 1 teaspoon garlic powder
  - 1 teaspoon smoked paprika
  - ¬Ω teaspoon salt
  - ¬Ω teaspoon black pepper
  - Oil, for frying

For the sweet and spicy soy glaze:
  - ¬Ω cup soy sauce (use a low-sodium variety if preferred)
  - ¬º cup maple syrup

Method:

1. In a large bowl, whisk together the flour, water, garlic powder, smoked paprika, salt, and black pepper until smooth. The batter should have a thick, pancake-like consistency that clings to the cauliflower florets. Adjust with more water or flour as needed.

2. Pour enough oil into a deep frying pan to cover the bottom by about an inch. Heat over medium-high heat until a small drop of batter sizzles upon contact.

3. Dip each cauliflower floret into the batter, ensuring it‚Äôs fully covered. Carefully place the coated florets into the hot oil, frying in batches to avoid overcrowding. Fry for about 5-7 minutes or until golden brown and crispy. Remove with a slotted spoon and drain on a paper towel to remove excess oil.

4. In a small saucepan, combine the soy sauce, maple syrup, sriracha, garlic, and ginger. Bring to a gentle simmer over medium heat, stirring occasionally. Once the mixture is heated through, add the cornflour mixture and stir continuously until the sauce thickens and becomes glossy, about 2 minutes.

5. Transfer the fried cauliflower wings into a large mixing bowl. Pour the hot glaze over the wings, tossing gently to coat each piece thoroughly with the sauce.

6. Serve immediately, garnished with sesame seeds and chopped spring onions for added crunch and flavour. These wings are best enjoyed hot, straight from the pan, while they retain their crispiness.",

there are a lot of options for spices, salt pepper cumin, paprika garlic powder liquid smoke, soy sauce

bake for like 40 minutes in a 200c oven

lph3jiy,t3_1fs1rt2,1fs1rt2,"[Full recipe available here.](https://www.plantifulpalate.com/post/vegan-mac-and-cheese)

Ingredients:
* 400g macaroni pasta
* 2 cups unsweetened almond milk (or any plant-based milk)
* 1 cup vegan cheese, shredded
* 1/2 cup nutritional yeast (for added ‚Äúcheesy‚Äù flavour)
* 2 tbsp vegan butter
* 2 tbsp all-purpose flour (to make the roux)
* 1 tsp garlic powder (for extra depth of flavour)
* 1 tsp onion powder
* 1/2 tsp smoked paprika (plus extra for garnish)
* Salt and pepper, to taste
* Fresh parsley, chopped (for garnish)

Method:
1. Bring a large pot of salted water to a boil and cook the macaroni until it‚Äôs al dente, according to the package instructions. Drain and set aside.
2. In a large saucepan, melt the vegan butter over medium heat. Whisk in the flour to create a roux and cook for about 2 minutes, ensuring it doesn‚Äôt brown. This forms the base of the creamy cheese sauce.
3. Gradually whisk in the almond milk, stirring constantly to prevent lumps. Continue cooking until the mixture thickens slightly, around 3-4 minutes.
4. Add the shredded vegan cheddar, nutritional yeast, garlic powder, onion powder, smoked paprika, and a pinch of salt and pepper. Stir continuously until the cheese has melted and the sauce is smooth and creamy. If the sauce appears too thick, you can add a little more almond milk to reach your desired consistency.
5. Stir in the cooked macaroni, ensuring every piece is well coated with the luscious vegan cheese sauce.
6. Transfer to a serving dish and sprinkle extra smoked paprika on top for a touch of colour and heat. Garnish with fresh parsley for a pop of green and serve hot.",

lpv91k6,t1_lpv8o8v,1fs1rt2,"I guess melting like cheese is different from cooking out in a roux, which is just about emulsifying the fats.",

Adding it before won‚Äôt do anything to decrease the quality or taste of the tahini.

lzl2322,t1_lzkxia9,1h2kfvz,Yes you have to press it. If you want even more then freeze it and let it thaw that will create loads of holes and nooks for it to cling on to,
lzrt70f,t1_lzkxia9,1h2kfvz,Chinese people boil their tofu in salted water for 10 minutes to open it up and it works wonders for absorbtion. Easy to do while preparing the marinade. I've also done this to refresh tofu that has gotten a lil slimy.,

lczjkxe,t3_1e2adix,1e2adix,"###Ingredients

* 3 heaping tbsp peanut butter
* 2/3 cup coconut milk
* 2 tbsp maple syrup
* 1 to 2 tbsp sriracha (depending on spice preference)
* 1 tbsp sesame oil
* 3 tbsp soy sauce
* 2 tbsp grated garlic
* 1 tbsp grated ginger
* 1 lime, juiced
* 1 block extra or super firm tofu, drained, dried, & cut into 16 evenly sized cubes
* oil, salt, & pepper as needed
* 1 handful cilantro, finely chopped
* 2 scallions, thinly sliced on the bias
* 1/2 cup crushed peanuts
* 1 tsp white & black sesame seeds
* 1 tbsp chili crisp oil
* rice for serving

###Instructions

1. In a large bowl, whisk together the peanut butter, coconut milk, maple syrup, sriracha, sesame oil, soy sauce, 1 large pinch salt, black pepper to taste, garlic, ginger, & lime. Set aside.

1. Heat a cast iron pan over medium-high heat and allow to heat up a 2-3 mins. Place 4 cubes tofu on each small skewer. Add 3-4 tbsp neutral cooking oil to the pan and sear the tofu. Season the tofu in the pan with a large pinch of salt and black pepper to taste. Sear on all four sides, about 1-2 mins per side, or until each side is golden brown. Pour half the peanut sauce over the tofu in the pan. Continue to flip tofu, searing for another 1-2 mins each side, or until desired texture and color.

1. Serve tofu skewers over rice and finish with extra peanut sauce, cilantro, scallion, crushed peanuts, sesame seeds, and chili crisp. Enjoy!

When you say you haven't had success, does it not get bubbly/foamy at all? I think the first time I whipped it I was expecting it to be as fluffy as egg whites for a meringue, but It never gets that fluffy for me, more like whipped cream if you leave it on the counter and it melts a bit and gets more dense lol. Also it works a lot better with the aquafaba from commercially canned chickpeas rather than the cooking liquid if you cook your own chickpeas from dry. I think if you use the cooking liquid you have to further cook the liquid down to get more water out before it will whip. I hope any of this helps!!",

Lmao. Anywaysssss) 1 tsp salt. THREE cups shredded zucchini, DO NOT DRAIN. The wetness combines everything. You‚Äôll add about 1 cup of vegan chocolate chips and fold it into the recipe. the other 1/4 vegan chocolate chips over the top.  

This isn‚Äôt my recipe I actually found it online when I didn‚Äôt know what to do with all the extra zucchini‚Äôs I had.  

Preheat 350¬∞ and use a 9x by 13x, line with parchment paper. Sugar oil vanilla, mix together until the sugar is brown and combine thoroughly. Now add Flour, cocoa powder, and salt- I shift them when I add them so it combines easier. Fold in the zucchini and wait a few mins. Add the chocolates into the batter and fold it in. You‚Äôll pour batter into the pan and then add the rest of the chocolates on top. bake it for about 25-38 mins depending on your oven. *PLEASE PLEASE PLEASEEEEEEEEE use the tooth pick method to determine your brownie batter bakeness* (I‚Äôve had 2 people ask me for this before and burned their brownies cause they didn‚Äôt know about the tooth pick method possibly going into a chocolate chip. If it comes back with a very wet like it was stuck in a chocolate chip re try with a new one and stick it again) when the brownies are done I put it on a wire rack with the parchment paper and cover it with parchment paper and either into a container or aluminum foil. Yes it freezes VERY WELL, yes you can re heat it for about 7-10 seconds depending on your microwave watt, and yes if you have no self control you may eat a good portion of it‚Ä¶‚Ä¶ I highly recommend whatever ‚Äúmilk‚Äù you use with it.

I just mentioned that in case anyone else was searching for particular brownie mixes and wanted to know exactly what I tried. I make things using normal not-high elevation directions all the time and they usually work --- it really shouldn't be that dramatic of a difference. If it works well with Duncan Hines, then the problem is this particular brownie mix unless we just have pretty different tastes in brownies. It was edible in the middle, but just not particularly brownie-like  and definitely had too much oil --- the exact same kind of problem a lot of other people have posted here about with brownie mixes before. I think eggs absorb a lot more oil. So if it works with the Duncan Hines mix it must have some kind of emulsifier or else a better ratio of ingredients.",

lki1p98,t3_1f42mst,1f42mst,"[Full recipe available here.](https://www.plantifulpalate.com/post/vegan-tofu-jalfrezi)

Ingredients:
- 400g firm tofu, drained and cubed
- 2 tbsp vegetable oil
- 1 large onion, thinly sliced
- 2 cloves garlic, minced
- 1-inch piece of ginger, grated
- 2 large tomatoes, pureed
- 1 red bell pepper, chopped
- 1 green bell pepper, chopped
- 2 green chilies, sliced
- 1 tsp cumin seeds
- 1 tsp ground coriander
- 1 tsp ground cumin
- 1 tsp turmeric powder
- 1 tsp garam masala
- Salt, to taste
- Fresh coriander, chopped (for garnish)

Method:
1. Begin by pressing the tofu to remove excess moisture. Wrap the tofu in a clean kitchen towel and place a heavy object on top for about 15 minutes. Once pressed, cut the tofu into bite-sized cubes and set them aside.

2. Heat the vegetable oil in a large pan over medium heat. Add the cumin seeds and wait for them to sizzle and pop, releasing their aromatic oils. This is your foundation of flavor.

3. Add the thinly sliced onions to the pan and saut√© them until they turn a deep golden brown. This caramelization process enhances the sweetness of the onions, balancing the heat of the spices. Next, stir in the minced garlic and grated ginger, cooking until fragrant‚Äîabout 2 minutes.

4. Pour in the pureed tomatoes, stirring them into the onion mixture. Cook this down until the oil begins to separate from the tomato base, creating a rich masala. This step is key to developing the deep, complex flavors that define a good jalfrezi.

5. Incorporate the ground coriander, ground cumin, turmeric, and garam masala into the tomato mixture. Cook the spices for 3-4 minutes, allowing them to bloom and infuse the masala with their warmth and depth.

6. Toss in the chopped red and green bell peppers along with the sliced green chilies. Stir everything together and let the peppers cook for 5-7 minutes. They should soften slightly but retain a bit of crunch, adding texture to the dish.

7. Gently fold in the tofu cubes, ensuring they are evenly coated with the spiced masala. Allow the tofu to simmer in the sauce for about 5 minutes, soaking up all the wonderful flavors.

8. Adjust the seasoning with salt to taste. Garnish generously with freshly chopped coriander before serving.",

Ingredients:

	‚Ä¢	400g vegan tagliatelle
	‚Ä¢	2 tbsp olive oil
	‚Ä¢	1 clove garlic, minced
	‚Ä¢	100g fresh basil leaves
	‚Ä¢	50g rocket (arugula), plus extra for garnish
	‚Ä¢	30g pine nuts
	‚Ä¢	3 tbsp nutritional yeast
	‚Ä¢	100ml extra virgin olive oil
	‚Ä¢	Juice of 1/2 lemon
	‚Ä¢	Salt and freshly ground black pepper
	‚Ä¢	100g sun-dried tomatoes, drained and roughly chopped
	‚Ä¢	80g pitted black olives

Method:

	1.	Bring a large pot of salted water to a boil. Add the tagliatelle and cook according to the package instructions, or until al dente. Once cooked, drain and reserve a cup of the pasta cooking water. Set the tagliatelle aside.
	2.	While the pasta is cooking, prepare the pesto. In a food processor, combine the fresh basil leaves, rocket, pine nuts, nutritional yeast, lemon juice, and minced garlic. Blend until well combined, slowly pouring in the extra virgin olive oil while processing until a smooth pesto forms. Season with salt and black pepper to taste.
	3.	In a large frying pan, heat 2 tablespoons of olive oil over medium heat. Add the drained sun-dried tomatoes and saut√© for 2-3 minutes, allowing their flavours to deepen. Add the pitted black olives and stir well to combine, letting them warm through for another minute.
	4.	Reduce the heat to low and add the cooked tagliatelle to the pan. Toss gently to coat the pasta with the sun-dried tomatoes and olives. Add the prepared pesto to the pasta, using a little of the reserved pasta cooking water if needed to help loosen the sauce and ensure every strand is evenly coated.
	5.	Once everything is well combined and heated through, remove from the heat. Serve the tagliatelle in bowls, garnishing with a handful of fresh rocket leaves for an added peppery bite.",

* 1 red onion, cut into wedges
* 1 bulb of garlic
* 2 tbsp good quality extra virgin olive oil
* Sea Salt and black pepper
* 700g butterbeans + their stock (the water in the can/jar, check if it‚Äôs salted first then omit any added salt if so!)

Other tips: After they have been soaked/marinated, snip them with scissors into smaller pieces (if they are too long - the bigger the bag size you get, the less uniform the strips are, generally speaking).

  
Also, figure out how much marinade to soak them in before cooking - ideally, it will be just enough so the curls are rehydrated totally and there isn't much excess marinade left. That will give them full flavor. You can marinade them in a bowl straight out of the freezer, too.",

This is why Chilli, Dal, Bean/pulse stews, Tofu, Soy chunks etc are raved about so much more. More protein, cheaper, less volumn/easier to eat.",

Wrap in parchment and tightly wrap with foil then pressure cook for an hour and a half or steam for 2ish hours flipping halfway. I let it cool for a bit then break em open and let it cool a bit more before ripping it up with my hands. Don't let it sit uncovered to long or it will dry out, can store with broth to keep it moist.

lrpk7g1,t3_1g22k75,1g22k75,This looks amazing!,
lrmyj2z,t1_lrkt4f7,1g22k75,"This will be super fun!! Thanks for this great recipe!

Update: I made it tonight and everyone loved it!! It's going in our regular rotation now. Easy and really good! I like how it's flexible--my husband and I like vegan sausage, so we'll add some to our bowls next time, and my daughter doesn't, so I won't! Plenty of protein either way. Thanks!",
lrnfnut,t1_lrl159t,1g22k75,"Why not just make regular dumplings and make seitan bits to add like chicken if you want additional protein?

I imagine the texture of the dumplings would change quite a bit with additional gluten.

But maybe you know something I don't. How do the dumplings come out? How much gluten do you add?",
lrnn2kg,t1_lrnfnut,1g22k75,"I've done this with a standard recipe, except I used vegan chicken drumsticks from the Asian market (pan fried to give firm texture and added towards the end). Used basic biscuit recipe for the dumplings. Was legit.",
lt2wbhe,t1_lrnfnut,1g22k75,"How do you make the seitan chicken? i'd love to try it.

  
The dumpling texture does change, but not badly imo. I use a 50/50 mixture and it basically make the dumplings feel dense, rather than the chewiness you associate with a full-on gluten texture. I also add salt & baking powder.",
