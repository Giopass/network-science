m768324,t1_m72jd1o,1hzb4do,"OK Relax. It’s a phrase. Yes, by virtue of just being alive, no matter how low impact we try to be, critters are going to die in the process. Just walking down the street, we likely step on and kill multitudes of ants, aphids, and other little insects. I got stung by a bee the other day and obviously the bee died. I suppose if we all just opt to die, then we will truly be cruelty free. I have no interest in dying at this point in my life. 

I do however have an interest in living as low impact at possible. To me this means walking or using transit wherever possible, buying locally sourced foods and other products where possible, living minimally, and not eating or using any animal product. This isnt me attempting to be righteous or virtuous, it’s just what keeps me going. 

You do understand that a meat eating diet kills far more animals as well I hope. The amount of grain that is needed to feed a cow, pig, or chicken to produce 1000 calories of meat is anywhere from 6 to 9 times more than the amount of land required to produce 1000 calories of just crops. So that’s 6-9 times more field mice, deer, birds, and other critters killed in the production of food stuffs for livestock than for a human that just ops to eat only crops. This isn’t to mention the livestock that is being slaughtered, and  mind the insane water usage. 

So no, the fact that even the most staunch vegan is going to kill animals as a byproduct of their existance hasn’t escaped me. But what has seemed to escape you is that the cruelty and environmental impact of a vegan is going to be far less than that of a meat eater. But I digress, perhaps the phase should be cruelty-light.",

 I really want to understand your stand on this as it can help me understand the point of view of Vegans on the entire topic. Because, ill be real with you, thusfar this only sounds like hypocrisy, though I might just be missunderstanding",
m6t8udy,t1_m6t8awq,1hzb4do,"I already explained it. A **confirmation of harm** (animal sentience) is more important to worry about than a mere *teensy possibility* of harm (plant ""sentience"", which is only a mere concept so far).

Just tried this recipe. Thanks for posting.The beetroot made mine a vivid red.  I'd like to note the place where i went wrong.

I substituted the cashew for sunflower seeds (allergies), which i don't recommend. The sunflower flavor is stronger than i thought it would be. I also have found that my blender sucks so it came out a bit gritty. Next time i'll try tofu like you mentioned in another comment.",

lyllqxj,t3_1gy3qeq,1gy3qeq,"[Full recipe available here.](https://www.plantifulpalate.com/post/vegan-ravioli)


Ingredients:

For the Ravioli Dough:

- 300g all-purpose flour
- 100g semolina flour
- 1 tsp salt
- 200ml warm water
- 2 tbsp olive oil

For the Ravioli Filling:

- 200g firm tofu, crumbled
- 2 tbsp nutritional yeast
- 1 clove garlic, minced
- 1 tbsp lemon juice
- Salt and black pepper, to taste

For the Roasted Red Pepper Sauce:

- 3 large red bell peppers
- 2 tbsp olive oil
- 1 medium onion, finely chopped
- 3 cloves garlic, minced
- 200ml vegan cream cheese
- 1 tbsp nutritional yeast
- 1 tsp smoked paprika
- 1 tsp dried oregano
- Salt and freshly ground black pepper, to taste
- 1 tsp lemon juice

For Garnish:

- Fresh basil leaves, chopped

Method:

1. Preheat your oven to 200°C. Cut the red bell peppers in half and remove the seeds and membranes. Place them on a baking tray lined with parchment paper, cut side down. Roast for 20-25 minutes, or until the skin is charred and blistered. Once roasted, place the peppers in a bowl and cover with cling film for 10 minutes to steam. Peel off the skin and set the roasted peppers aside.

2. In a large frying pan, heat 1 tablespoon of olive oil over medium heat. Add the chopped onion and sauté for 5-6 minutes until softened and translucent. Stir in the minced garlic and cook for another 1-2 minutes until fragrant.

3. Add the roasted red peppers to a blender, along with the sautéed onion and garlic. Spoon in the vegan cream cheese, nutritional yeast, smoked paprika, and dried oregano. Blend until the mixture is smooth and creamy. Season with salt, black pepper, and lemon juice to taste.

4. To make the ravioli dough, combine the all-purpose flour, semolina flour, and salt in a large bowl. Make a well in the centre and add the warm water and olive oil. Mix until a dough forms, then knead on a floured surface for 8-10 minutes until smooth and elastic. Wrap in cling film and let it rest for 20 minutes.

5. While the dough is resting, prepare the filling. In a medium bowl, combine the crumbled tofu, nutritional yeast, minced garlic, lemon juice, salt, and black pepper. Mix well until evenly combined.

6. Once the dough has rested, divide it into two equal portions. Roll each portion out on a floured surface until it is very thin (about 2mm thick). Place small spoonfuls of the filling, about 4cm apart, on one sheet of the rolled dough. Place the second sheet of dough over the top, pressing around each mound of filling to seal. Use a knife or ravioli cutter to cut out individual ravioli pieces, ensuring the edges are sealed well.

7. Bring a large pot of salted water to a boil. Cook the ravioli in batches for 3-4 minutes, or until they float to the surface. Drain and set aside.

8. Pour the blended roasted red pepper sauce back into the frying pan and warm it over low heat. Add the cooked ravioli to the sauce, gently tossing to coat each piece in the creamy sauce.

9. Divide the creamy ravioli between four bowls. Garnish with chopped fresh basil leaves for a burst of colour and flavour.",

lyqnjwl,t1_lymfoef,1gy3qeq,You can also freeze tofu to get the excess water out. Ii keep mine in the freezer and just take it out a few hours before I need it. It gives it a great texture,

lyr8buh,t1_lyr5zh5,1gy3qeq,"No, just let it thaw and then process as usual. The freezing squeezes out a lot of the water molecules. The texture is greatly improved.

the only note I can give is that you want to be patient with flipping the tofu. it needs to develop that brown crust before it unsticks from the pan. but again, with nonstick you shouldn’t really be having this issue. hmmmmm.",

My next few rolls were pretty enough to serve.",
m133f94,t1_m12qalb,1h9q8bo,It’s not that bad. Worst case you mess it up and make it into a poke bowl!,

I’m still wanting to try the tofu “crab salad”. I like to steam and pulse (in food processor) tempeh, sriracha, and mayo for a “tuna” roll. Roasted red pepper and scallion go great in that one. One of my favorite. And I could eat the inari right out of the can (and have, honestly).",
m14r8gl,t1_m12qalb,1h9q8bo,"Honestly, even if it comes out a little wonky, it will be delicious. It's more important to get the ratios right of filling to rice. I think OPs looks perfect.  

I have made some slightly wonky but delicious roll in the past. If it really fails, just make a rice bowl and try again in the future. Either way you will have something delicious to eat.",

I meant to put this in my post, but I'll leave it here:

Filling ideas

Cucumber/avocado/shredded or julienned carrot (I like those with sriracha inside)

Inari (fried bean curd pockets that weirdly come shelf stable in a can)/asparagus/vegan cream cheese

Plain avocado or tempura sweet potato

Pretty much any veggie you like can go in these, and some fruits such as mango",
m13v0xs,t1_m13urvz,1h9q8bo,Heck yeah. What filling are you doing,

m13wdcf,t1_m12vx0v,1h9q8bo,"Onigiri is incredibly easy. But you need Japanese rice or it will not stick together. Just cook rice, wet your hands until dripping, salt your hands, scoop rice into your hands, shove your middle stuff into them (I love umeboshi in mine) and mold them like a hot potato (rice will be piping hot). Let cool after shaping and put nori on at the last moment possible or the nori will get soggy.",
m14c8fc,t1_m12s9f0,1h9q8bo,I love inari - I usually just eat it filled with sushi rice. I've never seen it in a can! (I normally buy it refrigerated.) I'll have to specifically look for it next time.

lw6z0ge,t1_lw6wq10,1gm2fcj,"Sure, but if I'm watching recipe videos, it's because I want to watch videos with actual recipe in them... 

As a head of marketing, I know you're doing that to generate traffic to your website where you get ad revenue, but I think you'd get more results in the long run by showcasing the ingredients in the videos and tell people to go to the blog to know more. Your videos would bring more value themselves rather than only being a tool to generate traffic. I could be wrong though. If your way works better, I'm probably just not your target audience...

I dont make any money from your data and dont plan to. I am sorry you are so upset about this. I will have a look into how I can make the full opt outs easier in the future.

EDIT:

So, I did some digging, and from what I understand, to correctly process a global opt-out or other data requests, I need to verify the requester’s identity. That means I need some identifiable information to ensure it's the correct person.

A lot of sites don’t offer these requests in an embedded form like this—you typically have to email them manually to make the same request.

With Complianz, I could remove the form (including the checkboxes), but then you’d have to go through the hassle of emailing, making it less convenient and transparent.

As for cookies, I’ve made sure to implement a simple consent banner that allows you to easily manage preferences. I’m not collecting any more data than what’s necessary to run the site and comply with privacy laws, and cookies are used only for functionality, analytics, and potential future ads.

I could easily eat half this recipe as a single serving, and if you were to use normal soy sauce, ketchup, AND salt the tofu conservatively, that's easily approaching or over 2 grams for half the recipe.

* 4 large potatoes
* 2 tbsp olive oil
* Generous amount of sea salt & freshly cracked black pepper
* 1/2 tsp smoked paprika
* 1/2 tsp garlic powder
* 1/2 tsp onion powder
* 1/2 tsp oregano
* 1/2 tsp dried rosemary
* Fresh parsley to serve

###Instructions

1. Preheat your oven to 200°C fan forced. Peel your potatoes, then slice off the tops and bottoms followed by the sides to create flat edges. Slice down lengthways to create 3 even thick pieces.
2. Place between a pair of wooden chopsticks and slice vertically. Flip then slice diagonally. Repeat with all the potato slices then place onto a lined baking tray.
3. In a small bowl, mix together the salt, pepper, paprika, garlic powder, onion powder, oregano and rosemary.
4. Brush oil mixture over the potatoes to evenly coat each slice then bake in the oven for 25-30 minutes. Flip and bake for another 15 minutes or until golden and crispy.
5. Transfer to a plate and garnish with fresh parsley. Enjoy immediately while hot and crispy!

m5dujlp,t3_1htjug6,1htjug6,"[Full recipe available here](https://www.plantifulpalate.com/post/homemade-vegan-gnocchi)

Ingredients:

For the Gnocchi:
- 1kg potatoes (e.g., Maris Piper)
- 200g plain flour, plus extra for dusting
- 1 tsp salt

For the Tomato Sauce:
- 2 tbsp olive oil
- 1 large onion, finely chopped
- 3 garlic cloves, minced
- 1 tsp ground cumin
- 1 tsp smoked paprika
- 1/2 tsp chilli flakes (optional)
- 400g canned chopped tomatoes
- 2 tbsp tomato purée
- 1 tsp sugar (optional, to balance acidity)
- Salt and freshly ground black pepper, to taste

For the Plant-Based Cream:
- 150g unsweetened plant-based yoghurt (e.g., coconut or soy)
- 1 tsp lemon juice
- 1/4 tsp garlic powder
- Pinch of salt

For Garnish:
- 2 tbsp fresh parsley, chopped
- Freshly ground black pepper

Method:

1. To make the gnocchi, start by peeling the potatoes using a vegetable peeler. Rinse them under cold water to remove any residual starch. Place the peeled potatoes in a large pot and cover with cold, salted water. Bring to a boil and cook for 15-20 minutes, or until the potatoes are fork-tender but not falling apart. Drain the potatoes and let them sit for a few minutes to release excess steam. Mash the potatoes using a potato ricer or masher until completely smooth, ensuring there are no lumps. Allow them to cool slightly. Gradually mix the flour and salt into the mashed potatoes, adding a little at a time, until a soft dough forms. Knead the mixture gently until it forms a soft dough. Avoid overworking the dough to keep the gnocchi light and fluffy.

2. Divide the dough into four portions. Roll each portion into a long rope about 2cm in diameter, then cut into 2cm pieces. For a classic gnocchi texture, press each piece gently with the back of a fork to create ridges. Dust with a little flour to prevent sticking.

3. Bring a large pot of salted water to a boil. Add the gnocchi in batches and cook until they float to the surface, about 2-3 minutes. Remove with a slotted spoon and set aside.

4. For the tomato sauce, heat olive oil in a large frying pan over medium heat. Add the chopped onion and sauté for 6-8 minutes until softened and translucent. Stir in the minced garlic and cook for an additional 1-2 minutes until fragrant.

5. Add the ground cumin, smoked paprika, and chilli flakes (if using) to the pan, stirring to coat the onion mixture. Cook for 30 seconds to release the spices’ aromas.

6. Stir in the canned tomatoes, tomato purée, and sugar (if needed). Season with salt and black pepper. Simmer the sauce over medium heat for 10-12 minutes, stirring occasionally, until it thickens slightly and the flavours meld together.

7. While the sauce simmers, prepare the plant-based cream by whisking together the yoghurt, lemon juice, garlic powder, and a pinch of salt in a small bowl. Set aside.

8. Add the cooked gnocchi to the tomato sauce, stirring gently to coat them evenly. Simmer for an additional 2-3 minutes to warm through.

9. Transfer the gnocchi and sauce to serving bowls. Add dollops of the plant-based cream on top and garnish with fresh parsley, a drizzle of extra virgin olive oil and a generous sprinkle of freshly ground black pepper.

10. Serve warm and enjoy!",

* Add the flour and tomato paste. Stir until well incorporated and no clumps of tomato paste remain.
* Add the broth (or water), frozen peas and carrots, and frozen corn. Bring the liquid to a boil then reduce to simmer. Simmer for 5 minutes, stirring occasionally.
* Set the meat mixture aside. Preheat oven to 400 degrees F.
MAKE THE POTATO TOPPING.
* Place the potatoes in a large pot. Cover the potatoes with water. Bring the water to a boil. Reduce to a simmer. Cook until potatoes are fork tender, 10-15 minutes.
* Drain the potatoes in a colander. Return the potatoes to the hot pot. Let the potatoes cook a bit for minute or two to evaporate any remaining liquid.
* Add vegan butter, milk, garlic powder, salt, and pepper. Mash the potatoes and stir until all the ingredients are mixed together.
ASSEMBLE THE CASSEROLE.
* Pour the impossible meat mixture into a baking dish. Spread it out into an even layer. Spoon the mashed potatoes on top of the impossible meat. Carefully spread into an even layer.
* If the baking dish looks very full, place it on a rimmed baking sheet so that the filling doesn’t bubble over into your oven. Bake uncovered for 25-30 minutes. Cool for 15 minutes before serving.",

There are big companies who have to provide veggy products or they'd go under. most employees i spoke to said transition is fine though, they are just raking it in with those products because it's even more overprocessed massproduced shit, than the regular meat stuff ever would have been. 
The regular meat comes from the slaughterhouse in the next city, grain fed beef - grown in the next city (literally for the company i have in mind).

No offence but the bar to become a chef is so low that this doesn't really make you sound as knowledgeable as you think it does. Working in kitchens when I was a student was a real eye opener, and a lot of the stereotypes aren't as far from the truth as I thought they would have been. 

> Maybe read less and talk to people i guess?

Ah, the foundation of knowledge. Ever heard of JBS or Tyson Foods? Let's not pretend all meat comes from the next city everywhere. Even if it did, you might want to look up why cattle rearing is bad for the environment no matter how far from the kitchen it is reared. Emissions and land use not that great, you know. Fake meats might not be all that healthful (no worse than beef...) but at least they don't burp methane.

lc17hdt,t3_1dxfrdb,1dxfrdb,"###Ingredients

* 1/2 an onion, finely chopped
* 5 cloves garlic, crushed
* 1 tbsp tomato puree
* 3-4 large tomatoes, chopped
* 2 x 400g tins of butterbeans
* Small handful of torn fresh basil
* 250g firm tofu - Tomato flavored shown in the gif, but if you can’t find this, just use firm tofu and add a bit more tomato puree and salt
* 3 heaped tbsp nooch
* 2 tbsp white miso
* Splash of water

**To serve**

* More fresh basil
* Extra virgin olive oil
* Toasted sourdough bread or cooked grain of choice

###Instructions

1. Sauté the onions in plenty of olive oil and a pinch of salt for 8 mins. Add garlic and fry three mins more, then add tomato puree, the chopped fresh tomatoes and a big pinch of salt.

1. Bring to the boil, then bubble and simmer for 5-6 mins. Add the beans + their juices from the can (I pour a little out of the top first) and the basil, reserving a little for garnish. Bubble for a further 5 mins.

1. Scoop out 2 spoonfuls and blend with the firm tofu (I use a tomato flavored one but if you can’t find this, add a little more tomato puree and salt) the nooch, and the miso. Add a splash or two of water to help it blend to a smooth consistency, season to taste. (Tip the tomatoey tofu cream into the beans, mix and gently heat.)

1. Serve with olive oil, black pepper and enjoy with a slice of sourdough bread.

* 1/2 tsp white pepper
* 1/2 tbsp Shaoxing wine
* 1 cup cornflour
* Oil for frying

**Spice mix**

* 1 tsp salt
* 1 tsp white pepper
* 1 tsp five-spice powder
* 1 tsp sugar

**To Serve**

* Fresh basil leaves

###Instructions

1. Tear the tofu into bite-sized cubes
2. In a large bowl, mix cornflour with salt, white pepper, five-spice powder, garlic powder, and onion powder.
3. Toss the tofu cubes in the seasoned starch mixture until they are evenly coated.
4. In a wok, heat the oil, Carefully place the coated tofu cubes into the hot oil. Fry them in batches to avoid overcrowding the pan, until they are golden brown and crispy. Remove with a slotted spoon and drain on paper towels.
5. Fry Basil leaves true quickly in the same oil until they become crispy (about 15-20 seconds). Be cautious, as the oil may splatter.
6. Serve the popcorn tofu hot, garnished with fried basil leaves and enjoy!!

lkydms3,t3_1f5n7wr,1f5n7wr,Try some sweet potato starch if you can get it as a replacement for corn starch. Might give a bit subtle sweetness and chewy as well. But regardless it's all delicious (from your resident Taiwanese here).  It's the more standard starch usually for deep fried dishes in Taiwan.,

lki10rj,t3_1f42jzu,1f42jzu,"###Ingredients

* Tender/Semi Firm Tofu 800g
* Sparkling Water 200ml
* Corn Starch 50g
* Panko 150g
* Garlic 2 Heads
* Fresh Chili 20g
* Salt 1 tsp
* Soy Sauce 2 tbsp
* Sesame 1 tbsp
* Scallion 3 Stalks
* Oil

###Instructions

1. Cut tofu into cubes(about 2cm*2cm), first dip the tofu in sparkling water, coat it in corn starch, then dip it in sparkling water again and coat the tofu again in panko. Chop the garlic, chili and scallion into small pieces.
2. Heat up the wok(medium heat), when it’s hot enough add oil, add tofu, pan-fry until all sides are golden and crispy, then take it out. The tofu might stick together because of the starch, separate them carefully with spatula or chopsticks while pan frying.
3. Add garlic to the wok(medium-high heat), stir for 30s then add the chili, stir for another 30s, add tofu, then add salt and soy sauce
4. Mix quickly and sprinkle the sesame and scallion on top

* Avocado oil and spray for baking
* 1, 16 oz package super firm tofu or extra firm tofu (if using extra firm press for 15 minutes before using)
* 2 tbsp tamari
* Juice and zest 1/2 a lemon
* 1/3 cup cornstarch or all-purpose flour
* 1/2 cup soy or almond milk
* 1 tsp apple cider vinegar
* 1 tsp fresh thyme leaves (about thyme 5 sprigs)
* 6 sage leaves
* 2 inch sprig of rosemary
* 1/2 cup panko breadcrumbs
* 1/4 cup nutritional yeast
* 1 tsp garlic powder
* 1/2 tsp paprika
* 1/2 tsp kosher salt and more to taste

**To Serve**

* Your favorite gravy (Mushroom gravy shown in gif)

###Instructions

1. Preheat the oven to 425F. Prepare a quarter sheet pan by brushing with 1-2 tbsp of oil to coat the bottom of the pan then set aside.

1. Cut your tofu block into 3-4 slabs lengthwise. Place the slabs in a resealable freezer bag or an airtight container with the tamari and lemon juice. Seal the container and gently shake to coat and set aside to marinate for at least 10 minutes.

1. Set up three shallow bowls. To one bowl add the cornstarch. To the second bowl add the milk and vinegar. Let it sit for 2-3 minutes, add a pinch of salt then whisk together.

1. Place the thyme, sage, and rosemary on a cutting board then finely mince with a knife. Add the minced herbs to the last bowl along with the breadcrumbs, nutritional yeast, lemon zest, garlic powder, paprika, and 1/2 tsp of salt.

1. Using one hand for wet ingredients and the other for dry ingredients, coat the slab of marinated tofu in cornstarch. Dip the coated tofu into the milk mixture then transfer to the bowl of seasoned breadcrumbs making sure the tofu is completely coated.

1. Transfer the breaded tofu to the baking tray and spray the tops of the tofu slabs with a little oil. Bake the tofu for 15 minutes, then flip and bake for an additional 5-10 minutes until golden. Slice and serve the tofu as desired and enjoy.

Recipe:
Ingredients:

For the cauliflower wings:
  - 1 medium cauliflower, cut into florets
  - 1 cup plain flour
  - 1 cup water
  - 1 teaspoon garlic powder
  - 1 teaspoon smoked paprika
  - ½ teaspoon salt
  - ½ teaspoon black pepper
  - Oil, for frying

For the sweet and spicy soy glaze:
  - ½ cup soy sauce (use a low-sodium variety if preferred)
  - ¼ cup maple syrup

Method:

1. In a large bowl, whisk together the flour, water, garlic powder, smoked paprika, salt, and black pepper until smooth. The batter should have a thick, pancake-like consistency that clings to the cauliflower florets. Adjust with more water or flour as needed.

2. Pour enough oil into a deep frying pan to cover the bottom by about an inch. Heat over medium-high heat until a small drop of batter sizzles upon contact.

3. Dip each cauliflower floret into the batter, ensuring it’s fully covered. Carefully place the coated florets into the hot oil, frying in batches to avoid overcrowding. Fry for about 5-7 minutes or until golden brown and crispy. Remove with a slotted spoon and drain on a paper towel to remove excess oil.

4. In a small saucepan, combine the soy sauce, maple syrup, sriracha, garlic, and ginger. Bring to a gentle simmer over medium heat, stirring occasionally. Once the mixture is heated through, add the cornflour mixture and stir continuously until the sauce thickens and becomes glossy, about 2 minutes.

5. Transfer the fried cauliflower wings into a large mixing bowl. Pour the hot glaze over the wings, tossing gently to coat each piece thoroughly with the sauce.

6. Serve immediately, garnished with sesame seeds and chopped spring onions for added crunch and flavour. These wings are best enjoyed hot, straight from the pan, while they retain their crispiness.",

crumbled tofu, finely diced onions, bread crumbs, chickpea flour, spices

glaze and bake, something like 1:1:4 soy sauce ,tomato paste, harissa, sriracha or ketchup to 4 parts oil, I feel like spices go best in the mixture not the glaze

so test fry one in a skillet ,its not gonna be great because you need to bake it but yo uget the sense of the spices

there are a lot of options for spices, salt pepper cumin, paprika garlic powder liquid smoke, soy sauce

bake for like 40 minutes in a 200c oven

~ because my oven doesnt even have tempetature numbers its just a flame, kinda hard to explain to you how you should turn on your oven based on the size of my ovens flames",

But at Daiya, we believe everyone should be able to enjoy plant-based cheese, even on a beef burger.” The ad finishes with the words “enough controversy, let’s eat.”

ly86762,t1_ly7gub1,1gvul1u,"i guess puffed tofu would work too, for a ready product.

but the air fried tofu has a crispy outer shell that both takes on flavour very well and prevents the whole tofu chunk/cube from becoming muchy. and the middle is soft and spongy.

air fry, then in a bowl mix a bit of olive oil, soy sauce, herbs and seasoning you like. toss in the air fried tofu to absorb the flavour. it will look and taste very well in this dish.",

lph3jiy,t3_1fs1rt2,1fs1rt2,"[Full recipe available here.](https://www.plantifulpalate.com/post/vegan-mac-and-cheese)

Ingredients:
* 400g macaroni pasta
* 2 cups unsweetened almond milk (or any plant-based milk)
* 1 cup vegan cheese, shredded
* 1/2 cup nutritional yeast (for added “cheesy” flavour)
* 2 tbsp vegan butter
* 2 tbsp all-purpose flour (to make the roux)
* 1 tsp garlic powder (for extra depth of flavour)
* 1 tsp onion powder
* 1/2 tsp smoked paprika (plus extra for garnish)
* Salt and pepper, to taste
* Fresh parsley, chopped (for garnish)

Method:
1. Bring a large pot of salted water to a boil and cook the macaroni until it’s al dente, according to the package instructions. Drain and set aside.
2. In a large saucepan, melt the vegan butter over medium heat. Whisk in the flour to create a roux and cook for about 2 minutes, ensuring it doesn’t brown. This forms the base of the creamy cheese sauce.
3. Gradually whisk in the almond milk, stirring constantly to prevent lumps. Continue cooking until the mixture thickens slightly, around 3-4 minutes.
4. Add the shredded vegan cheddar, nutritional yeast, garlic powder, onion powder, smoked paprika, and a pinch of salt and pepper. Stir continuously until the cheese has melted and the sauce is smooth and creamy. If the sauce appears too thick, you can add a little more almond milk to reach your desired consistency.
5. Stir in the cooked macaroni, ensuring every piece is well coated with the luscious vegan cheese sauce.
6. Transfer to a serving dish and sprinkle extra smoked paprika on top for a touch of colour and heat. Garnish with fresh parsley for a pop of green and serve hot.",

If you add it after, you would most likely need to add other liquid to the tahini to make it evenly coat the beans. This may make the freshly crisp beans soggy due to the excess liquid.
Adding it before won’t do anything to decrease the quality or taste of the tahini.

lczjkxe,t3_1e2adix,1e2adix,"###Ingredients

* 3 heaping tbsp peanut butter
* 2/3 cup coconut milk
* 2 tbsp maple syrup
* 1 to 2 tbsp sriracha (depending on spice preference)
* 1 tbsp sesame oil
* 3 tbsp soy sauce
* 2 tbsp grated garlic
* 1 tbsp grated ginger
* 1 lime, juiced
* 1 block extra or super firm tofu, drained, dried, & cut into 16 evenly sized cubes
* oil, salt, & pepper as needed
* 1 handful cilantro, finely chopped
* 2 scallions, thinly sliced on the bias
* 1/2 cup crushed peanuts
* 1 tsp white & black sesame seeds
* 1 tbsp chili crisp oil
* rice for serving

###Instructions

1. In a large bowl, whisk together the peanut butter, coconut milk, maple syrup, sriracha, sesame oil, soy sauce, 1 large pinch salt, black pepper to taste, garlic, ginger, & lime. Set aside.

1. Heat a cast iron pan over medium-high heat and allow to heat up a 2-3 mins. Place 4 cubes tofu on each small skewer. Add 3-4 tbsp neutral cooking oil to the pan and sear the tofu. Season the tofu in the pan with a large pinch of salt and black pepper to taste. Sear on all four sides, about 1-2 mins per side, or until each side is golden brown. Pour half the peanut sauce over the tofu in the pan. Continue to flip tofu, searing for another 1-2 mins each side, or until desired texture and color.

1. Serve tofu skewers over rice and finish with extra peanut sauce, cilantro, scallion, crushed peanuts, sesame seeds, and chili crisp. Enjoy!

lfzzuq6,t1_lfzzjf7,1ehgh7b,I tried the pumpkin a few weeks ago and it was vile lol,
lg0y0vf,t1_lg0vezo,1ehgh7b,As far as I know it's just from chickpeas,

lg1cy4w,t1_lg18k3j,1ehgh7b,3tbsp per egg that the recipe calls for,
lg33v3c,t1_lfzd53n,1ehgh7b,Wild,
lg7p25k,t1_lfzd53n,1ehgh7b,Would you be able to use defrosted aquafaba? I know some people tend to freeze it.,
lg11y73,t1_lg0fou5,1ehgh7b,Smart,
lg0c0hw,t1_lfzh899,1ehgh7b,"Just think of it as starch, as it's basically bean starch.  The trick is also to go for the ""No added Salt"" versions of chickpeas - otherwise there is a salty beany taste.",
lg2zsnp,t1_lg1s2uv,1ehgh7b,It doesn't. All my recipes at work (vegan baker) say to whip it but I stopped doing that bc I'm a lazy fuck and everything literally turned out better lmfao,
lg60lf8,t1_lg4ok43,1ehgh7b,"I haven't tried not whipping it, so I'm not sure how that would change the taste/texture? I will say last time I made a recipe with aquafaba, my hand mixer broke, so I just went at it with a fork for like 5 - 10 minutes and it actually turned out fine and still got fluffy enough! When you say you haven't had success, does it not get bubbly/foamy at all? I think the first time I whipped it I was expecting it to be as fluffy as egg whites for a meringue, but It never gets that fluffy for me, more like whipped cream if you leave it on the counter and it melts a bit and gets more dense lol. Also it works a lot better with the aquafaba from commercially canned chickpeas rather than the cooking liquid if you cook your own chickpeas from dry. I think if you use the cooking liquid you have to further cook the liquid down to get more water out before it will whip. I hope any of this helps!!",
lg2uv0w,t1_lg1vxoz,1ehgh7b,"I’m on mobile: 1/2 cup veg oil. 1 1/2 cups sugar. 1 tsp vanilla ex. 2 cups all p-Flour. 1/2 cups unsweetened coco powder. 1 1/2 tsp bking soda (baking soda I got baking soda ya know that song ? Lmao. Anywaysssss) 1 tsp salt. THREE cups shredded zucchini, DO NOT DRAIN. The wetness combines everything. You’ll add about 1 cup of vegan chocolate chips and fold it into the recipe. the other 1/4 vegan chocolate chips over the top.  

This isn’t my recipe I actually found it online when I didn’t know what to do with all the extra zucchini’s I had.  

Preheat 350° and use a 9x by 13x, line with parchment paper. Sugar oil vanilla, mix together until the sugar is brown and combine thoroughly. Now add Flour, cocoa powder, and salt- I shift them when I add them so it combines easier. Fold in the zucchini and wait a few mins. Add the chocolates into the batter and fold it in. You’ll pour batter into the pan and then add the rest of the chocolates on top. bake it for about 25-38 mins depending on your oven. *PLEASE PLEASE PLEASEEEEEEEEE use the tooth pick method to determine your brownie batter bakeness* (I’ve had 2 people ask me for this before and burned their brownies cause they didn’t know about the tooth pick method possibly going into a chocolate chip. If it comes back with a very wet like it was stuck in a chocolate chip re try with a new one and stick it again) when the brownies are done I put it on a wire rack with the parchment paper and cover it with parchment paper and either into a container or aluminum foil. Yes it freezes VERY WELL, yes you can re heat it for about 7-10 seconds depending on your microwave watt, and yes if you have no self control you may eat a good portion of it…… I highly recommend whatever “milk” you use with it. And yes technically the recipe calls for butter (to grease down the parchment) but i do not add the butter to the pan, i put a bit of oil on a paper towel and grease it down",
lg042b1,t1_lg01phc,1ehgh7b,I have a coworker that makes chocolate chip zucchini bread it's good!,
lg97z8c,t1_lg0ystb,1ehgh7b,Just brownie mix and canned coconut milk. That’s it and bake as normal,

lgicyw7,t1_lg2cous,1ehgh7b,Thank you!!,
lg75802,t1_lg45hw6,1ehgh7b,"Sorry, to clarify, I don't think the issue was high elevation. I just mentioned that in case anyone else was searching for particular brownie mixes and wanted to know exactly what I tried. I make things using normal not-high elevation directions all the time and they usually work --- it really shouldn't be that dramatic of a difference. If it works well with Duncan Hines, then the problem is this particular brownie mix unless we just have pretty different tastes in brownies. It was edible in the middle, but just not particularly brownie-like  and definitely had too much oil --- the exact same kind of problem a lot of other people have posted here about with brownie mixes before. I think eggs absorb a lot more oil. So if it works with the Duncan Hines mix it must have some kind of emulsifier or else a better ratio of ingredients.",
lisaqj9,t1_lg45hw6,1ehgh7b,I had the same problem at regular elevation. You didn’t cut the oil at all? There is literally a puddle of oil on top of my brownies. I followed your instructions exactly. I used Duncan Hines.,

lh0hxhs,t1_lg60lf8,1ehgh7b,"I see. Maybe I'll try it again.  

I did use liquid from canned chickpeas with a good stand mixer. I also once went as far as reducing it (boiling it until about half evaporated) because I read it might make it more ""whippable"".  Still didn't work.  Not sure if it's bad luck or I'm just doing the same mistake every time without realizing.",

lky0by8,t1_lg97z8c,1ehgh7b,Do you use a whole can of coconut?,
lisaud6,t1_lg75802,1ehgh7b,Agree. I just wasted a box mix and aquafaba on this….they are inedible oily.,
lise31b,t1_lisaqj9,1ehgh7b,Nope! I wonder what happened. My oven actually broke on another batch of dolly partons and they sat in there for an hour at 240 degrees before I fixed it and got it to 350 for like 20 minutes and they still actually turned out ok just chewy.,
lg33a6p,t1_lg2th9j,1ehgh7b,Omg yes all the comments on the pumpkin one I saw were positive and they can't wait to make it again. The texture and the taste were just so off putting I was so confused! Glad it wasn't just me,

lki1p98,t3_1f42mst,1f42mst,"[Full recipe available here.](https://www.plantifulpalate.com/post/vegan-tofu-jalfrezi)

Ingredients:
- 400g firm tofu, drained and cubed
- 2 tbsp vegetable oil
- 1 large onion, thinly sliced
- 2 cloves garlic, minced
- 1-inch piece of ginger, grated
- 2 large tomatoes, pureed
- 1 red bell pepper, chopped
- 1 green bell pepper, chopped
- 2 green chilies, sliced
- 1 tsp cumin seeds
- 1 tsp ground coriander
- 1 tsp ground cumin
- 1 tsp turmeric powder
- 1 tsp garam masala
- Salt, to taste
- Fresh coriander, chopped (for garnish)

Method:
1. Begin by pressing the tofu to remove excess moisture. Wrap the tofu in a clean kitchen towel and place a heavy object on top for about 15 minutes. Once pressed, cut the tofu into bite-sized cubes and set them aside.

2. Heat the vegetable oil in a large pan over medium heat. Add the cumin seeds and wait for them to sizzle and pop, releasing their aromatic oils. This is your foundation of flavor.

3. Add the thinly sliced onions to the pan and sauté them until they turn a deep golden brown. This caramelization process enhances the sweetness of the onions, balancing the heat of the spices. Next, stir in the minced garlic and grated ginger, cooking until fragrant—about 2 minutes.

4. Pour in the pureed tomatoes, stirring them into the onion mixture. Cook this down until the oil begins to separate from the tomato base, creating a rich masala. This step is key to developing the deep, complex flavors that define a good jalfrezi.

5. Incorporate the ground coriander, ground cumin, turmeric, and garam masala into the tomato mixture. Cook the spices for 3-4 minutes, allowing them to bloom and infuse the masala with their warmth and depth.

6. Toss in the chopped red and green bell peppers along with the sliced green chilies. Stir everything together and let the peppers cook for 5-7 minutes. They should soften slightly but retain a bit of crunch, adding texture to the dish.

7. Gently fold in the tofu cubes, ensuring they are evenly coated with the spiced masala. Allow the tofu to simmer in the sauce for about 5 minutes, soaking up all the wonderful flavors.

8. Adjust the seasoning with salt to taste. Garnish generously with freshly chopped coriander before serving.",
lkib9d3,t3_1f42mst,1f42mst,"This looks amazing, and I want to commend you on the fact you said to cook the onions till they're a deep golden brown and listed no time frame. I read so many recipes and they're like cook the onions till they start to brown and then list 4-5min which is no where near enough time to properly cook the onions down which impacts the flavor of the dish for the worst.",

Ingredients:

	•	400g vegan tagliatelle
	•	2 tbsp olive oil
	•	1 clove garlic, minced
	•	100g fresh basil leaves
	•	50g rocket (arugula), plus extra for garnish
	•	30g pine nuts
	•	3 tbsp nutritional yeast
	•	100ml extra virgin olive oil
	•	Juice of 1/2 lemon
	•	Salt and freshly ground black pepper
	•	100g sun-dried tomatoes, drained and roughly chopped
	•	80g pitted black olives

Method:

	1.	Bring a large pot of salted water to a boil. Add the tagliatelle and cook according to the package instructions, or until al dente. Once cooked, drain and reserve a cup of the pasta cooking water. Set the tagliatelle aside.
	2.	While the pasta is cooking, prepare the pesto. In a food processor, combine the fresh basil leaves, rocket, pine nuts, nutritional yeast, lemon juice, and minced garlic. Blend until well combined, slowly pouring in the extra virgin olive oil while processing until a smooth pesto forms. Season with salt and black pepper to taste.
	3.	In a large frying pan, heat 2 tablespoons of olive oil over medium heat. Add the drained sun-dried tomatoes and sauté for 2-3 minutes, allowing their flavours to deepen. Add the pitted black olives and stir well to combine, letting them warm through for another minute.
	4.	Reduce the heat to low and add the cooked tagliatelle to the pan. Toss gently to coat the pasta with the sun-dried tomatoes and olives. Add the prepared pesto to the pasta, using a little of the reserved pasta cooking water if needed to help loosen the sauce and ensure every strand is evenly coated.
	5.	Once everything is well combined and heated through, remove from the heat. Serve the tagliatelle in bowls, garnishing with a handful of fresh rocket leaves for an added peppery bite.",

lp0nuq7,t3_1fpweye,1fpweye,"###Ingredients

* ½ a medium Aubergine, diced into small chunks
* 1 Red Pepper, diced into small chunks
* 200g Cherry Tomatoes
* 1 medium courgette, cut in half, then into wonky triangles
* 1 red onion, cut into wedges
* 1 bulb of garlic
* 2 tbsp good quality extra virgin olive oil
* Sea Salt and black pepper
* 700g butterbeans + their stock (the water in the can/jar, check if it’s salted first then omit any added salt if so!)

**Cheesy sauce**

* 1 scoop of the roasted veg
* The roasted garlic cloves
* 3 tbsp nooch
* 100g silken tofu
* 2 tbsp of the butterbeans
* Juice of one lemon
* 1/2 tsp salt (less if the beans are already salty)
* Ground black pepper

**To serve**

* Sourdough Bread
* Fresh basil
* Lemon zest
* Black pepper
* Extra virgin olive oil

###Instructions

1. Preheat oven to 200 degrees Celsius (fan setting)

1. In a baking tray, add all the veg, 3/4 of the cherry tomatoes, garlic, olive oil, salt and pepper, toss and cover with tin foil, then bake for 25mins, or until soft but not completely mushy. Get the dish out the oven but don’t turn it off, yet. Remove the foil, allow the mix to cool a little, then scoop out one large spoonful and add it the blender with the rest of the ingredients listed above (including the roasted garlic cloves) Blend the mix, season to taste, then pour into the roasted veg mix.

1. Add all the rest of the butterbeans to the roasted veg, draining a little canning liquid off the top of there is a lot of it, or rinsing if you desire and replacing the lost water with a little fresh tap water. Mix everything together really well, then add the rest of the cherry tomatoes to the top of the dish, nestling them into the mix. Drizzle with olive oil, then bake (no foil) for 10-15 mins, until golden and bubbly.

1. Serve with the fresh basil, olive oil, lemon zest and eat with toasted sourdough.

ltcb3cz,t1_ltc12w3,1ga96ng,"I think it also depends on how long it stays in the freezer. The longer you keep it, the more spongy it becomes, but I still haven't gotten it to a state in the picture, although fairly close to it.",
ltcg9e6,t1_ltc12w3,1ga96ng,"Try doing it twice. Freeze, thaw, freeze, thaw. It creates an airy texture that soaks up flavor. I do this for my ""fried chicken"" and for stir fry.

silken tofu is very different to the normal tofu, and can be very hard to get in some places (it is not sold at all where i live, for example). the person above said it like it's a blanket statement, when it's not. details are needed for this, so people do not get disappointed when they don't get the wanted result during cooking.",

10/10 would do it again.",
ltckh8x,t1_ltc81hn,1ga96ng,Yes that’s the issue. You want the medium tofu to get this result.,

i still think it has more to do with the type of tofu (the one they sell here if super extra firm) and cooking method than freezing.",
lthrgeg,t1_ltcg9e6,1ga96ng,never done that! will do that next time i pull out a block from a freezer. thank you for the advice!,
lthreis,t1_ltcjsv5,1ga96ng,"yes, frozen tofu is common in chinese cuisine. but it doesn't mean it always looks like what op showed in the picture. the airy quality is much less common, and is more to do with cooking technique and tofu itself (fresh tofu), than freezing/thawing.",

ltcigdb,t1_ltcgc0w,1ga96ng,"It's because you are r/confidentlyincorrect. It's a tofu puff which is made by deep frying tofu. No freezing necessary.

Also, figure out how much marinade to soak them in before cooking - ideally, it will be just enough so the curls are rehydrated totally and there isn't much excess marinade left. That will give them full flavor. You can marinade them in a bowl straight out of the freezer, too.",

m1q75vl,t3_1hcphe9,1hcphe9,Yummy ! The veggies look rly good in this,
m1q9i3d,t3_1hcphe9,1hcphe9,You can also steam the veggies. Advanced practitioners have a steamer basket to put on top of the pasta pot.,

m1qy1el,t3_1hcphe9,1hcphe9,"This sounds great. I've been obsessed with [Goodles Loopdy Loos](https://www.goodles.com/products/loopdy-loos/) lately, the protein is close and they're packed with veggie vitamins.",
m1qznml,t3_1hcphe9,1hcphe9,This is how I cook when my wife is out of town. If I'm not cooking for someone else I want fast and few dishes.,
m1r05cl,t3_1hcphe9,1hcphe9,Doesn’t actually look half bad. Not sure why you’re being ratio’d.,

m1q9dmv,t3_1hcphe9,1hcphe9,"Other than USE REAL GARLIC IT'S EASY, it all looks delish.",
m1rcfh9,t3_1hcphe9,1hcphe9,"Probably because its $30 for 750g of pasta (on their website) when you can get regular semolina pasta for like $8 per 750g and the  protein difference is like 3g per 100 cals (Banza's 6g protein per 100 cals vs normal pasta's 3g per 100 cals). Basically you are paying a premium for pasta shaped beans.

This is why Chilli, Dal, Bean/pulse stews, Tofu, Soy chunks etc are raved about so much more. More protein, cheaper, less volumn/easier to eat.",
m1qibw5,t3_1hcphe9,1hcphe9,Wouldn't just using beans instead of pasta Mac be lower carb and higher protein?,
m20dq0w,t3_1hcphe9,1hcphe9,I misread the title as Vegan Butcher Show.,
m1q52ou,t1_m1q45h3,1hcphe9,"The key to chickpea is to overcook them compared to what you’d do with regular pasta. Raw chickpea flour tastes a w f u l. But once it’s cooked through it’s delicious. So, if the box says 7-8 minutes… do 8. Do 8 minutes 10 seconds.

Once cooked through it works as pasta. It will never be absolutely the same, but it works, and a box of this has 24 grams of plant protein, and powers you through the day.",
m1q2ezt,t1_m1q1ixq,1hcphe9,Target sells it for 3.39. It’s the most common kind down here. I get it in bulk at Costco.,

m1q68fm,t1_m1q5jof,1hcphe9,"Daiya is honestly the worst and I hate it, but if it works for you it is absolutely something I have done a bunch of times, too.

The way it works with the vegan cheese powder is it emulsifies in olive oil and the water from the steamed veggies and pasta and makes a kind of sauce that works, and it’s easy to adjust to taste. If it isn’t good, add more spices and vinegar.",

m1q6mrm,t1_m1q68fm,1hcphe9,"No, I hate daiya. That's why I stopped buying mac and cheese. I just make a high protein cheese sauce with tofu and nooch plus other seasonings. 

I bought the banza on a whim. I've seen mixed reviews.",
m1qjtao,t1_m1qjnkk,1hcphe9,Ok. What's that Mac I've never seen it I'm from the uk,
m1q6s73,t1_m1q6mrm,1hcphe9,A lot of the reviews are obviously undercooking the chickpea pasta. It absolutely cannot be al dente. Overcook it every time.,
m1q71b3,t1_m1q6mrm,1hcphe9,I used to do a Parmesan powder when I still bothered with a nutribullet with blanched almonds garlic paprika and nooch. It was good. But nutribullets are a pain to clean and wake up sleeping children.,
m1qs2dt,t1_m1qjtao,1hcphe9,It’s Banza. It’s a chickpea pasta brand in the us that’s ubiquitous where I am. Probably the most common after the brand with the bunnies. But honestly just use what you got that’s vegan Mac and cheese preferably with high protein pasta and don’t use Daiya and you’ll be fine. Daiya is awful. Blech.,
m1q77h7,t1_m1q6s73,1hcphe9,I definitely will! I want to give it a very fair shot. I'm looking for a brand I like to have on hand when I don't feel like doing much cooking!,
m1qsayz,t1_m1qs2dt,1hcphe9,Yeah we don't have daiya,
m1q7oii,t1_m1q77h7,1hcphe9,"I like red lentil pasta better for true Italian style dishes, but it gets a bit… crumbly? The mouthfeel is always a bit off. Still. Gotta get those gains! Gimme that protein!",
m1qtzj1,t1_m1qsayz,1hcphe9,You are fortunate. It is bad.,
m1q89mu,t1_m1q7oii,1hcphe9,"I loathe red lentil pasta. The texture is a hard no. I love lentils, eatthem everyday. I'd rather use whole wheat pasta, or the Barilla protein pasta and then add whole lentils to the sauce or dish.",
m1q9cv6,t1_m1q89mu,1hcphe9,I feel that. Chickpea pasta will have the texture of slightly overcooked pasta. It will never be the real thing but it will get the job done!,

lux0xcp,t1_luwygg0,1ghbxlp,"The seitan I make uses 360g of gluten, 415ml of water, 60g of nooch, 60g coconut oil, 60ml of vinegar and whatever spices/msg/mushroom powder/onion powder/garlic. The key to shredded texture is a very moist dough that is overworked in a standing mixer, 10-15 mins on medium then rest for a bit then another 10-15 mins. Wrap in parchment and tightly wrap with foil then pressure cook for an hour and a half or steam for 2ish hours flipping halfway. I let it cool for a bit then break em open and let it cool a bit more before ripping it up with my hands. Don't let it sit uncovered to long or it will dry out, can store with broth to keep it moist. My favorite way to cook it is to just toss the pieces in peanut oil and Chilli powder and stir fry and serve over rice.",

m0f9egm,t1_m0eizfa,1h6mk0x,"This looks amazing. I was wondering, since you're making tiny strips with the tofu, would I be able to substitute king oyster mushrooms torn into strips, kind of like a mushroom pulled pork, and use it the same for this recipe? Can't wait to try this!",
m0m9k7q,t1_m0eizfa,1h6mk0x,Youre the best dude!!!!,
m0f3hzx,t1_m0eombv,1h6mk0x,Thank you!,
m0f3sbf,t1_m0eu739,1h6mk0x,"Oh nice, never seen that sub! Thank you!",
m0flhfc,t1_m0eu739,1h6mk0x,I've never heard of a chopped cheese sandwich and now realize my whole life could have been different 😭,😭
m0f3j55,t1_m0eqpry,1h6mk0x,Thank ya!,
m0ghh50,t1_m0f9wbg,1h6mk0x,"I've eaten it cold, room temp and warm and it's great no matter what. You can just zap it in the microwave until warmed through.",
m0gfuun,t1_m0f9egm,1h6mk0x,I’m not the OP but I bet you could! A vegan bar in my area makes a mushroom pâté very similar to this and I think the method would be very similar!,
m0gha6t,t1_m0f9egm,1h6mk0x,"Yes, totally, just make sure you cook them down so they aren't too chewy and you should be good!",
m0feqz1,t1_m0f3sbf,1h6mk0x,Just got made a week ago for us sandwich lovers.,
m0fwhd3,t1_m0flhfc,1h6mk0x,Haha yeah I have only become recently aware of it myself. These East coasters keeping things from us!,

lmkyewv,t3_1fdhc1g,1fdhc1g,"Glorious chauda! Will be trying this method, though I'd guess that soaking the cashews first in hot warer or part of the soup might help with that creamy texture?...",
lmjtt5z,t1_lmfk89w,1fdhc1g,Made this for dinner and my whole family stuffed ourselves on it.  Absolutely delicious!  I'mma make this again.,

Update: I made it tonight and everyone loved it!! It's going in our regular rotation now. Easy and really good! I like how it's flexible--my husband and I like vegan sausage, so we'll add some to our bowls next time, and my daughter doesn't, so I won't! Plenty of protein either way. Thanks!",
lrnfnut,t1_lrl159t,1g22k75,"Why not just make regular dumplings and make seitan bits to add like chicken if you want additional protein?

I imagine the texture of the dumplings would change quite a bit with additional gluten.

But maybe you know something I don't. How do the dumplings come out? How much gluten do you add?",
lrnn2kg,t1_lrnfnut,1g22k75,"I've done this with a standard recipe, except I used vegan chicken drumsticks from the Asian market (pan fried to give firm texture and added towards the end). Used basic biscuit recipe for the dumplings. Was legit.",
lt2wbhe,t1_lrnfnut,1g22k75,"How do you make the seitan chicken? i'd love to try it.

  
The dumpling texture does change, but not badly imo. I use a 50/50 mixture and it basically make the dumplings feel dense, rather than the chewiness you associate with a full-on gluten texture. I also add salt & baking powder.",
