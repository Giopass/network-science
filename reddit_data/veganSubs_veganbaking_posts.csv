for a 20 cm pan

marble cake base  
100 g flour  
75 g white sugar  
1 tsp vanilla sugar  
1 tbsp baking powder  
1 pinch of salt  
2 tbsp vegetable oil  
125 g sparkling water  
1 tbsp dutch cocoa powder  

cheesecake  
500 g vanilla soy yogurt (other plant-based yogurts like oat or coconut tend to yield a flan or custard texture)  
150 g vegan cream cheese (almond and coconut oil based works well)  
80 g white sugar (add more if desired)  
1 slice of lemon (with the peel, seeds removed)  
60 g corn starch  
60 g raw pistachios, peeled and soaked in water for 1 hour  
2 tbsp raspberry powder (made from blending freeze-dried raspberries)  

decoration  
100 g vegan white chocolate  
1 tsp raspberry powder  
pistachios  

preheat the oven to 180 °C, brush a pan with vegetable oil and line with baking paper  

combine the dry ingredients (except cocoa powder), add the oil and sparkling water. mix until just combined, avoiding overmixing. divide the batter in half, add the cocoa powder to one portion and mix. to create the marbling, pour a layer of vanilla batter in the center of the pan, then add a spoonful of cocoa batter in the center, alternating until the batter is used up. bake for 10 min. meanwhile, prepare the cheesecake filling  

in a blender, add vanilla soy yogurt, vegan cream cheese, sugar, lemon slice, vanilla extract, and corn starch. blend for 1-2 minutes, scraping down any unmixed starch if necessary. pour half of this mixture into a separate bowl. in the blender, add the soaked pistachios to the remaining mixture and blend for another minute  

in the other half of the cheesecake mixture, add the raspberry powder and stir with a fork until smooth and clump-free  

pour a layer of the pistachio mixture onto the marble base, then alternate with the raspberry and pistachio mixtures. drag a knife or chopstick through the layers to create a swirled pattern  

bake for 45-60 min, or until the surface is dry and slightly browned. let cool at room temperature for 1 hour  

for the white chocolate topping, melt the white chocolate over a hot water bath, stirring continuously. spread ¾ of the melted chocolate onto the cheesecake. in the remaining chocolate, add the raspberry powder. dot the raspberry chocolate over the white chocolate layer and swirl with a toothpick. decorate with pistachios. chill in the fridge for at least 6 hours before serving",raspberry pistachio cheesecake with marbled cake base💅🏻,t2_ukaq5wap,1.0,701,1730224968.0,1730224968.0,16,yynnss1,1gf135x

VeganBaking,"first time making vegan donuts and i learned a lot! …like how i should let them cool a little bit before dipping them in the glaze. they were so delicious though and i can’t wait to make more and get creative with the glaze/toppings and dough! 

recipe: 

Let’s Make Maple Donuts! 🍩

For the Dough: 

- 1 1/4 Cups [300mL] of Plant-Based Milk ( i used soy)
- 1 Packet of Yeast [or 2 1/4 tsp]
- 1 tsp [5 ml] Sugar 
- 1/3 cup [75g] Vegan Butter 
- 1/4 cup [50g] Sugar
- 1 tsp [5ml] Vanilla 
- 4 Cups [650g] Bread Flour 
- 1/4 tsp [1.2ml] Salt

Glaze:
  - 2 Cups [225g] Powdered Sugar 
- 2 Tbsp [30ml] Maple Syrup 
- 1/4 tsp [1.2ml]  Maple Extract 
- 2 Tbsp [30ml] Milk 
- Pinch of Salt (optional)

• Add yeast & 1 tsp of sugar to the warm mix and allow to bloom. 
• In a separate bowl, cream together the butter, sugar, and vanilla. 
• Once the yeast-milk has bloomed, add that to the butter and sugar mixture and mix. 
• Add the bread flour and 1/4 tsp salt and mix and knead until you get a smooth dough ball 
• Add the dough to a lightly greased bowl, cover, and let rise until it’s doubled in size. About 1-2 hours
• Roll out the dough and shape the donuts. 
• Place shaped donuts onto individual pieces of parchment paper and cover for 1 hour. 

• When ready to fry, place donuts in oil (that we allowed to get hot on LOW HEAT) along with the parchment paper. 
•CAREFULLY remove the parchment paper after a few seconds. Fry donut for 2-3 minutes each side. 
• Transfer to a cooling rack and let cool for a few minutes before dunking donut into maple glaze.

Maple Glaze: 

•Sift the powdered sugar into a bowl. 
• Add maple syrup, maple extract, and milk. Mix. 
• Add more milk for a runnier glaze, less for a thicker glaze. 
• Add a pinch of salt (optional)

sponge cake with almond custard cream, caramelized pear, and blackcurrant glaze

[the sponge cake recipe is from here](https://www.zuckerjagdwurst.com/en/recipes/vegan-sponge-cake-so-fluffy-and-easy)

caramelized pear  
150 g pear, peeled and diced  
50 g sugar  
a drizzle of lemon juice  
1 tbsp margarine  

in a bowl, combine the diced pear with the sugar and a drizzle of lemon juice, and give it a quick stir. let sit for 30 minutes until the pears release their juice. heat a small pot over medium heat, then carefully pour in the juice only, and bring to a simmer. reduce the heat to low and let it lightly caramelize. add the margarine and stir until fully incorporated. turn off the heat, add the pear pieces into the caramel, and coat them well. set aside. 

almond cream  
250 g almond milk  
20 g cornstarch  
40 g sugar  (could use more!) 
1 tsp vanilla sugar  
100 g room temperature margarine  
2 tbsp white almond butter  

make the custard by combining the almond milk, sugar, and cornstarch over low heat, stirring continuously until the mixture thickens. transfer to a bowl and cover with plastic wrap pressed directly onto the surface to prevent a skin from forming. let cool to room temperature.  
whip the margarine and almond butter until pale and fluffy. add the custard, one spoonful at a time, thoroughly mixing between each addition until all the custard is incorporated.  

blackcurrant glaze  
1 cup / 200 g blackcurrants  
40 g sugar  
1/2 tsp agar agar  
white almond butter for decoration  

blend the blackcurrants and sugar into a smooth puree. strain the puree into a pot to remove the seeds, then whisk in the agar. bring to a simmer, then turn off the heat. for glazing, ensure the mixture stays slightly above 40 °C; if it gets too cool, it could set immediately.  

spread half of the almond cream over the first sponge cake, layer with the caramelized pear, add the other sponge and spread the remaining almond cream on top. pour the blackcurrant glaze over the cream.  drizzle some white almond butter across the glaze and use a toothpick to create cute patterns. garnish with fresh blackcurrants and blanched almonds. chill the cake for at least 2 hours before serving.

VeganBaking,"I managed a naked cake with a design made of batter.

I did a sponge cake which was very dense (not sure why) that turned out to be perfect for piping. In fact, I had to add milk with the food coloring to make sure it was slightly thinner. Next time I'll add even more in the hopes that it will help remove the many air bubbles you can see. I did drop my pan on the counter before baking but the batter was slightly frozen so the air remained trapped.

I was slightly worried about using the sponge cake batter for the whole cake given its texture so I ended up doing my usual vanilla cake for the actual cake.

What I learned:
- You really don't need a lot of batter.  My sponge cake batter probably yielded 3-4 times more that what I needed.

- The sponge cake batter was totally pipeable.  It actually needs to be thinned out a little bit EXCEPT for the black which I used for the outline.  Next time, I'll (gently) drop the pan on the counter to remove air bubbles before freezing.

- Between the outline and the other colors, put the cake pan in the freezer for around 10 minutes.  This ensures that the design stays in place.  I also put it back in the freezer before I added the vanilla cake batter.  I made sure to add the cake batter from the outside in.  Not sure if it was necessary but I wanted to make extra sure the design wouldn't spread.

- Not sure how to fix this but the parchment paper ended up soaking moisture from the batter and became wavy which you can see on the design (the vanilla batter is totally flat though so I'm guessing my piping of the design took too long?).",I did it!,t2_5gas1,0.99,430,1731896008.0,1731896008.0,28,GotSomethingToSay,1gtu6ee

VeganBaking,"nussecke is a german shortcut pastry topped with apricot jam, caramelized hazelnuts and coated with chocolate

for a 22x30 cm rectangular pan
oven preheated to 180 °C, middle rack

shortcrust pastry:
100 g room temperature margarine or shortening (at least 75 % fat) 
80 g white or brown sugar (i use both) 
240 g wheat or spelt flour
20 g roasted soybean flour (can be found in some asian supermarkets, optional but gives an heavenly toasty flavor) 
70 g plant based milk
1 tsp vanilla extract
1 tsp baking powder
1/4 tsp salt
+ 4 tbsp apricot jam for later
cream the margarine with the sugar and vanilla, using a spatula. gradually add the milk—the mixture won’t be fully smooth, but that’s fine. 
add the remaining dry ingredients and knead to form a smooth, soft dough that isn’t sticky; add a little flour if necessary
press the dough into the oiled pan and flatten it evenly. you can also shape it directly on a baking sheet without a pan, trimming the edges afterward
spread the apricot jam, about 100 g, over the dough and prepare the hazelnut topping

caramelized hazelnuts:
65 g margarine
75 g white or brown sugar
2 tbsp liquid (water, rum, or other liquors as you prefer) 
300 g chopped hazelnuts (you can also substitute part of the hazelnuts with walnuts)
1 tsp vanilla extract

in a saucepan, combine margarine, sugar, liquid, and vanilla, melting everything over medium heat until it just begins to boil, reduce heat and let slightly color without fully browning —the oven will take care of this step
add the hazelnuts and stir with a spatula until they’re fully coated in the pre-caramel. the mixture should be moist but not overly sticky (if it's the case carefully add a splash of liquid and stir further). pour immediately over the dough and spread evenly

bake for 30-35 minutes, until the hazelnuts are well caramelized with no more bubbles on the surface. let cool at room temperature for about 20 minutes before cutting into triangles with an oiled knife. 
allow to cool completely before dipping the edges in molten vegan milk chocolate or gianduja (what i used), or dark chocolate if you prefer :) 

150 g chocolate are enough for a batch. 
if using dark chocolate, let it set overnight at room temperature. if using gianduja, it might only harden in the fridge! ",Nussecken - shortcut pastry w caramelized hazelnuts 🇩🇪,t2_ukaq5wap,1.0,375,1730485846.0,1730485846.0,6,yynnss1,1ghcdkk

VeganBaking,"walnut sponge cake with a white coffee buttercream+whipped cream and chocolate ganache

recipe for a removable 10x30 cm cake pan
oven preheated to 180 °C

walnut cake:
150 g flour  
50 g white sugar  
30 g brown sugar  
3 tsp baking powder  
1 pinch of salt  and cinnamon
60 g ground walnuts
3 tbsp vegetable oil  
50 g soy milk  
120 g sparkling water  

mix the dry ingredients, then add the liquids. mix just enough to get a smooth batter with no lumps. pour into the oiled pan and bake for 20 minutes. the top of the pan should reach no higher than the middle rack. let the cake cool before trimming the top.

coffee cream:
200 g soy milk  
25 g cornstarch  
25 g whole coffee beans  
60 g sugar  
1/2 tsp vanilla extract  
100 g vegan butter or shortening (should have at least 70 % fat) 
100 g cold vegan whipping cream + 1 tsp cornstarch  

in a saucepan, heat the soy milk, vanilla, and coffee beans over low heat for 15 minutes, stirring occasionally. the mixture should not boil. let cool then remove the coffee beans.  
add the cornstarch and sugar to the milk and heat again over medium heat to make a custard, stirring constantly. pour into a bowl and cover with stretch film directly touching the surface to prevent a crust from forming. let cool to room temperature. take the margarine out of the fridge (it should be at the same temperature as the custard)
whip the margarine with a handmixer until its creamy and pale. add the custard one spoonful at a time, beating on low speed. the mixture should be fluffy and smooth (thats called a german butter cream!) 

prepare the whipped cream by adding the cold cream to a COLD bowl (glass or stainless steel if possible) and whipping for a few minutes. add the spoon of cornstarch. whip again until the cream holds. gently fold the whipped cream into the buttercream using a spatula.  
spread over the cake base in the pan and chill for 2 hours

ganache:
100 g vegan milk chocolate 
1 tsp vegetable oil  
4 tsp vegan whipping cream  

melt everything in a double boiler and mix well. let cool a few minutes before drizzling over the cake. decorate with walnuts. let set at room temperature before chilling again to keep the ganache from turning cloudy - as you can see on the picture😭

VeganBaking,"You guys. I can’t believe it took me this long to finally brown some vegan butter. I missed that depth of flavor!  I am so pleased with the taste of these cookies. Texture is good, too!  

Looking forward to experimenting more, again, now. I lost my fire for a bit, there.  My vegan cookies were “good,” but I was struggling to get the same depth of flavor that I used to get with my “regular” chocolate chip cookies. At first, I actually preferred vegan chocolate chip to “regular” chocolate chip. The taste was nostalgic.  It reminded me of these giant, super-soft chocolate chip cookies that were sold in our school cafeterias. They were 50¢ each and, sometimes, the lunch ladies would pull them nice and early. They’d be so fudgy and dense in the middle— barely baked cookie dough that managed to set just in time for lunch. The edges had just enough of a bite, but they were not “crisp.”  I never bought a hot lunch.  I never packed a lunch, either. I would, however, indulge in one of those cookies— at least twice a week.  I did that for years. Always told myself I was going to save at least half a cookie to bring home and warm up. All those years— not once did I possess the self control required to successfully complete such a task. 

Anyway, I had always wanted to recreate those cafeteria cookies and, until I started baking vegan, I couldn’t crack it. I didn’t realize that their classically simple, sweet, doughy taste was due to the fact that they weren’t made with butter. For a while, these types of vegan chocolate chip cookies sustained me. I rode that nostalgia train. Then, I got bored. I shook things up by baking off some Levain copycat recipes. That definitely helped… for a few days. After this three-day biscuit-like cookie binge, I went through a weird time. Baked oats had me in a chokehold. Cookie dough baked oats, to be exact, and I lost a bunch of weight. 

I was in a chocolate chip cookie depression, it seemed. Eventually, things progressed to the point where I wasn’t even “baking” these cookie dough oats anymore. I was.. microwaving them.  Then, I couldn’t even be bothered to do that. “Raw protein cookie dough?” I asked myself. “That’ll do.”  

For weeks, this continued. My mother asked me if eating the same exact thing, every single day, was healthy. “Probably not,” I’d shrug. 

So, I switched to chocolate chip cookie dough *pancakes* (with added protein, too).  I ate this, every day, for weeks, instead. Progress. 

Salvation came in the form of a Broma Bakery YouTube short. I can only watch so many shorts, of ingredients being thrown together, mixed up into a dough, portioned out, baked off, and devoured by some influencer with a cookbook, before I find myself needing to do the same. Minus publishing the cookbook. Last “night,” at 3AM, I decided to make some cookies. Proper [vegan] cookies. 

I knew I could brown vegan butter. I just had some weird aversion to actually following through with it. Fear of… disappointment, perhaps. Sheer laziness?  Whatever the case, I looked up a basic “brown butter chocolate chip cookie” recipe (not Broma Bakery’s, ironically enough) and I was off to the races.

This is the result. I only chilled the dough for 12 hours, but I’d like to do a full 24 and actually use dark brown sugar, instead of light brown. That was all I had, however. The cookies have all been eaten, now, but they truly continued to get better the longer they sat. I can only imagine how they’d be with a 24hr+ chill *and* a solid 12-hour… set?  

I heard roasted/toasted soy bean powder can also give a nutty taste to cookies. Really want to try that along with a… roasted vegan white chocolate ganache filling?  That would be so good. Maybe.. add some orange zest?!  A brown butter toasted cornmeal cookie sounds good, too— with some sort of berry (toasted cornmeal inspo from Justine Snacks). 

Anyway..

**TLDR**:  I hate to say it, but I sort of lost my ummpf when I started baking vegan. All it took to get it back was browning some Violife butter. I’m a simple (wo)man.  **Recipe** was from Pinch of Yum- https://pinchofyum.com/browned-butter-chocolate-chip-cookies

Used flax egg to sub for egg (2tbsp flax with 6tbsp water— I use hot water.  Not sure if that’s correct, but that’s what I always do). Browned a whole block of Violife butter. Added a couple tbsp of almond milk because I thought my dough needed to be a little wetter. Recipe has forgiving measurements— it’s very basic, so there’s wiggle room. I also threw in a few tsp of cornstarch. I was just doing whatever I wanted. Also, I used cake flour. That was all I had… aside from bread flour, oat flour, coconut flour.. and a couple of Gluten-Free blends. Of course, you could use AP flour, as called for. I ran out of vanilla, so I threw in a tbsp of dark amber maple syrup, instead. I used a little more brown sugar than cane sugar. Not sure it was enough to make any real difference, though. I used diamond kosher salt.  More than called for. Oh, and I finished with flaky salt— but smoked salt would be so cool, here. Scooped with 3tbsp cookie/portion scoop. 350F for 10-12 mins for softer cookies. Overnight chill recommended!   Cookies get a nicer color than the posted picture shows.

Ingredients:

For the lava cakes:
* 100g dark chocolate (70% cocoa, vegan)
* 60g vegan butter, plus extra for greasing
* 50g plain flour
* 30g cocoa powder (preferably dutch-processed)
* 70g caster sugar
* 1/2 teaspoon baking powder
* 1/4 teaspoon salt
* 120ml almond milk (or any plant-based milk)
* 1 teaspoon vanilla extract

For serving:
* 4 scoops of vegan vanilla ice cream
* 50g dark chocolate, melted (for drizzle, optional)

Method:
1. Preheat the oven to 200°C (180°C fan) or gas mark 6. Generously grease 4 ramekins with vegan butter and dust with cocoa powder. Place the ramekins on a baking tray for easier handling.
2. Chop the dark chocolate into small pieces and melt it with the vegan butter in a heatproof bowl set over a saucepan of simmering water. Stir occasionally until smooth and glossy, then remove from heat and allow to cool slightly.
3. In a mixing bowl, sift together the flour, cocoa powder, caster sugar, baking powder, and salt.
4. In a separate bowl, whisk together the almond milk and vanilla extract. Gradually add the wet ingredients to the dry, whisking until a smooth batter forms.
5. Gently fold the melted chocolate mixture into the batter. Take care not to overmix, as you want to maintain a light texture.
6. Spoon the batter evenly into the prepared ramekins, filling them about three-quarters full. Smooth the tops with the back of a spoon.
7. Bake the lava cakes in the preheated oven for 12-15 minutes, or until the edges are firm and slightly pulling away from the ramekins but the centres still appear soft and jiggly.
8. Remove the ramekins from the oven and let them cool for 2-3 minutes. Run a knife around the edges to loosen the cakes, then carefully invert each ramekin onto a serving plate. Tap gently to release the cakes.
9. Drizzle each cake with melted dark chocolate and then top with a scoop of vegan vanilla ice cream. Serve immediately while warm. And of course enjoy!",Vegan Chocolate Lava Cakes,t2_2t7zs0u,1.0,311,1733681815.0,1733681815.0,6,Whiterabbit2000,1h9oz9w

I think this would be fantastic with an espresso simple syrup for a peppermint mocha vibe or some ganache to really play up the chocolate flavor. Frosting is absolutely dreamy.",chocolate peppermint cake,t2_12hy19m7fl,1.0,295,1733372978.0,1733372978.0,14,SugarSproutBakery,1h70uj4
