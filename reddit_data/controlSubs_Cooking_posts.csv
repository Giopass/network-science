Sorry to bother you all. It seems like everybody has years and years and years left, right up until they don't.

**Edit**

It turns out that at the end of the road, the things that really mattered were good times with friends and family, And these were almost all in the kitchen. 

I've gotten to be relatively old, and finding out what I have certainly was not a happy thing, but given the number of my friends over the years that died with no notice from a heart attack or vehicle accident or whatever, this weirdly seems like a bit of a gift that I know what's coming and have *some* idea of a timeline. Although not a really good idea. 

Go home make yummy food and have your friends and family over. Actual happy memories are all that matters, money, power, status, everything else is mostly all nonsense.

**Edit**
This outpouring support and sympathy is more than I could ever have imagined! Thank you all I really appreciate it; However in the [immortal words of Monty Python ""I'm not dead yet""](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EfOW9QrLs0o) 8-)

Right now I only have major annoyances but no show stoppers. 

I plan to continue enjoying family and friends and cooking as much as I can, it's just harder and slower now because the surgery kind of wrecked my left side. On the other hand[terrible pun intended] I'm right handed,  so I can still do a lot of stuff, it just takes longer. 

**PS if any of you are cooking for anybody that has cancer and has no appetite, I can tell you from first-hand experience that [the banana bread](https://www.bupkis.org/index.php/recipes-2/favorites/banana-bread) goes down really easily and sits really well.**

The weird part about all this was that I initially found it and made it for someone else who had cancer about 25 years ago, And now we make it for me.

I also can't express enough gratitude that due to the efforts of friends I've never met all over the world the things that made me happy during my life will continue to make others happy for decades or maybe even hundreds of years in the future. The internet which is the very definition of ""not permanent stuff"" is now the eternal keeper of the things in life which mean the most to me which were food and friends and family.

Please note that I have read and appreciate each and every one of your replies. I have not answered them all because doing things online while missing large chunks of my brain is quite a bit more difficult than it used to be. But know that I read them all and you're all appreciated and I thank you all.

Cooking,"Went into a store and the cheese display had a quarter wheel of parm. The label on the quarter wheel was clearly incorrect, saying that it was .42 pounds, and so was only $10.92. When I went over to the register to see if they would let me actually purchase it, it rung up as it showed on the label, and the cashier let me buy it! When I got home, it weighed 23 pounds! At $25.99/pound, that's $600 of cheese for only $11! I'm planning on giving a lot of it away to friends and family. I've cut it into ~1 lb chunks, vacuum sealed them, and split them between the fridge and freezer. What recipes should I make with my haul???

TLDR: Got an incredible deal on 23 lbs of parmesan cheese for only $11. What should I make?

Edit: photos https://imgur.com/a/23-lb-cheese-AEZcewy

Edit 2: To be clear, during the check out process the cashier was very aware that this was an absurd price for this large wheel of cheese, and had no qualms about ringing it up as it is. Also, if you look at the website for Murray's Cheese, you will notice that they are absolutely not a Mom & Pop shop, but have hundreds of locations across the USA.

Edit 3: To add some context, I actually arrived at the register without the cheese, and when the cashier asked ""anything else?"" I made a joke about ""not unless you'll actually sell me that quarter wheel of cheese for $11!"" She said ""bring it over!"" so I did, and when it rang up as $11 dollars and I was in shock, she made multiple jokes about it being 11 million dollars. As multiple people have stated in the comments, NY has a law that requires stores to sell their merchandise at the labeled price.

Cooking,"SOS: My burgers have gone from family favorite to something no one wants.

Two boys, 13 and 25, used to devour my burgers like they hadn't seen a meal in ages. Now? They're leaving sad, barely-touched meat discs on their plates. My boys have opinions, and they're brutal: 'weird,' 'too dry,' 'too oily,' 'too greasy,' and the soul-crushing 'it doesn't have any taste.'

To me, they've always been rather plain, but that seemingly was never a problem before. Something has changed, though I'm not sure what.

I'm using 80/20 ground beef, fresh as can be, from a decent grocery store in Massachusetts (Shaw's). My wife likes hers still mooing, but the boys want theirs perma-charred - no pink allowed.

Current recipe (use at your own risk): 7 oz of beef, manhandled into submission, flattened, and sacrificed to a medium-high skillet for 4 minutes per side. Cheese gets a 60-second cameo at the end. Brioche buns because I really do try to make my fam happy.

I've never had to season ground beef before, but maybe that's where I've gone wrong? Is there a secret burger society I'm not privy to? A bovine illuminati?

I could use some help. How do YOU make your burgers taste like actual food and not sad cow discs?

**EDIT: Wow, something like 80 comments in about 8 minutes. I'm doing it wrong. :)**  
**90+ minutes in, and now 500+ comments, I certainly hit a nerve with tasteless burgers. I'm really sorry and I won't do it again. Promise! :(**

Cooking,"I used to be happy, healthy, and social. I had a family, I had friends. Until that dark day when my wife asked me to spatchcock a chicken for a recipe. I had never heard of it before. 

As I ripped the backbone out of this flightless bird and smashed its pelvis into flat submission with my fist, I had no idea what this revelation would do to me.  

For I could never eat any other chicken again. I demanded that all chicken be as absurdly juicy and perfectly cooked as a spatchcocked bird. I accepted nothing less than the tender, perfectly mouthwatering meat of a dead, spineless, spatchcocked hen.  

I began refusing hens cooked with inferior processes. I interrogated waiters, then chose salmon when their answers failed to satisfy me. I ruined family dinners, get togethers with friends, and the office potluck. I simply could not eat chicken cooked by barbarians who failed to spatchcock it. A single bite from a piece of chicken that failed to impart the juicy, extravagant flavor of a spatchcocked bird would send me into an aggressive rant which often ended in tears.  

I write this, alone, from a basement apartment with the juices of a properly spatchcocked chicken rolling down my chin. I simply cannot - nay, will not - accept a boring existence outside of the spatchcock lifestyle.

Cooking,"Guess I should start out with how I got in the situation. I’m an executive member of a student organization at my college (don’t ask which) and one of my jobs is to feed the club at our events. I had a list of meals to cook planned in advance, so I wasn’t going in completely blind. The thing is, this year, our organization kind of ballooned in size. We have almost twice the amount of people we had last year. This meant that the more intricate meal that I had planned would definitely not work anymore. I only realized this on Thursday  night. What I ended up doing was frying 25 lbs of ground beef and slow cooking 6 chicken breasts to make tacos., with some salsa, sour cream, and shredded cheese for other fillings (not the healthiest, I know). And you know what? It worked. Really well. Everyone loved it, and there was plenty to go around. I even took home some leftovers. It didn’t even take that long.

Boxed cereal and milk is now no longer cheaper than eggs for the week’s breakfasts, the cheapest cuts of meat are no longer the “leftovers” (like chicken wings and ground beef.) Name brand preservative packaged food is the same price as “real” food.

Cooking,"I’m Cuban American, my grandparents came here from Cuba in the 60s (for obvious reasons). One thing I feel grateful for was getting authentic Cuban cooking from my grandmother for so many years - she never measured anything, she just knew how to make it all taste right. Even the best Cuban restaurants never came close to her food. 

One thing I remember is that her white rice was always so good. Good enough to eat a bowl of it on its own. It just had so much flavor, and white rice is a daily staple dish for almost all Cuban dishes. 

Now I’ve tried so hard to replicate her white rice. I’ve looked up recipes for Cuban white rice, but nothing was ever the same. 

I finally asked my mom, how the hell did grandma get her white rice so good? 

The answer: lard. My grandma would throw a huge glob of lard and some salt into the rice. Lol. 

I’ve always put olive oil in the rice but it’s not the same. So instead I put a huge pat of butter in it, and wow. It’s close, not the same, but really close. 

When I say huge, I mean like 2 TBSP. I normally only put 1/2 TSBSP of olive oil. 

The olive oil is fine, but the butter is just delightful.

Here are just some things that witntessed that drove me crazy these last 2 days: 

They were so dangerous and awkward with the knife and couldn't hardly rough chop onions or veggies .
They spent 15 minutes peeling the avacados by hand  like a orange instead of just quickly cutting it in half and scooping it out .
 They put the meat in a non preheated  pan when I told them to sear the meat .
Accidently dumping too much Seasoning.

Cooking,"Title says it all, really.

(Sorry if this is the wrong place to post this, if it there is somewhere more appropriate then I hope somebody can please point me to it before this is locked or something).

What's happened to chicken in the UK?  I'd often marinade my chicken before, but it never felt as necessary as it does now.  It doesn't even seem to absorb flavour while cooking in the same way.

Even poached chicken, which usually turns out melt-in-your-mouth tender, comes out as rubbery these days.

I remember something in the news about possibly lifting the ban on chlorinated chicken, a few years back.  Did this happen without anybody noticing?  I can't find anything to suggest that online.

\[**EDIT**\] So I don't need to keep repeating myself, I have found this problem in chicken breasts from the following places (though I should point out that it seems to be random in the chicken I buy, like poultry roulette);

* Supermarkets (high and low end)
* Hospitality wholesalers
* Butchers
* Farm shops

\[**EDIT 2**\] So, I don't don't like to brag, but I'm not a bad cook.  I don't have 1 single recipe for cooking chicken fillets.  I didn't know that people did that; chicken is like the potato of meat and poultry, it's so easy to work with, and there's just so much you can do with it.

I mentioned poaching because, as I said, it has always been good for making the chicken especially tender. Several of my family have severe stomach issues and normally have problems eating meat in general; poaching is usually the most reliable exception.  (Until now).

But I've found this issue is occurring even when poaching, baking it, grilling, frying/stir-frying, slow cooking, and even in the air fryer.  Sure, I don't use a meat thermometer every time, and I know that I should, but if it's happening through so many different methods, with different heats, and for different cook times, then I think it's safe to say that the problem isn't the way that I'm cooking it.

4.) Do not add condiments, dried fruits or eggs to things unless you're sure people love it.  
5.) Chili recipes are as polarizing as cilantro.  
6.) Just because you view a substitution as ""healthier"" does not make it more edible.  
7.) Just because someone was willing to eat a dish as a kid, does not mean they are willing to eat it now.  
8.) Adding meat to things is not always welcome, even if you cannot imagine a meal without it.

BLT. If you read a lot of my responses you will see I bring it up a lot because it is my absolute favorite meal all things considered, primarily the simplicity of it and how everybody could make it.

You want a fresh bread that is thicker cut, if you don't want to Make your own bread that is totally fine, you can get something like the Sara Lee artisan white bread.

Tomatoes have to be in season, that's non-negotiable. You want to cut them fairly thick and then immediately dry them by setting them on paper towels and then flipping them to absorb the extra moisture. Next salt them and put them in a single layer in a colander. The salt will absorb into the tomatoes removing extra moisture but also tenderizing them even further. You want to wait until the last moment to put them on your sandwich to give them as much time as possible to be tenderized. You can also add black pepper to them or an Italian seasoning shortly before serving.

The lettuce has to be romaine or a traditional green leaf lettuce, absolutely no iceberg.

The bacon is better if you go to a butcher and have it extra thick cut, but otherwise you want to go for the thickest cut the grocery store will sell which will usually be in the shape of a slab, not where it's been cut and layered in a thin package so you can see each individual slice. This will look like a single slab of bacon with no visible cuts. Cook this low and slow. 280° for whatever time it normally takes, remembering that it will harden when it cools so you want it to be a little soft since you want it to be just at the edge of crispy when cooled.

The mayonnaise is better if you make it yourself of course, but really you just want to avoid a mayo that uses soybean oil. Sunflower oil is the best, so sir Kensington mayonnaise is by far your best option.

Toast the bread lightly, put the mayonnaise on a fairly thick layer on the top and a thin layer on the bottom, then use a fresh black pepper. Get yourself a good grinder and black Tellicherry peppercorns. Then a nice light coating of sea salt.

Bacon should be applied first with the tomatoes on top then the lettuce.

This will produce a BLT that will be so good it will ruin every other BLT You will ever find at a restaurant. I'm not even joking or trying to exaggerate here, every person I've ever made these for that gets used to them eventually complains about how every BLT the order is terrible in comparison. My husband used to order BLTs all the time at restaurants for lunch, now he never does because he's always disappointed. It's especially disappointing because of how simple it is to make a BLT this good.

Cooking,"I made a coconut chickpea curry today and it was so good and as I was eating it I thought about how incredible it actually is that I could make it.

Somewhere in Indonesia someone picked coconuts from a tree and gave it to someone who gave it to someone who canned it and sent it to America where I could buy it for $2

Someone in India planted, cared for, and harvested their chickpeas crops and sent that over for me to buy for a dollar.

Some people probably in california grew onion  garlic, and tomato and someone drove that onion, garlic, and tomato across the state so I could get it at trader joes.

so many olives someone picked from Italy or some place in the middle east, and so much work to extract their oil, all just to grease my pan

Then I used some spices, sourced from all over that earth, that were once only affordable for the richest of the rich, and sprinkled them all into my pan like it was no big deal

Cooking,"Hi all,

My wife's lost much of her appetite due to cancer treatments. She'll crave something, but then the second she starts to eat it, she loses her appetite for it. The exception has been ""artificially sour"" flavors -- think Nerds, sour gummies, etc. She's also eating a lot of lemon yogurt.

In general, she tends to like acidic/spicy foods (her usual breakfast pre-treatment was eggs, mostly as a vessel for hot sauce and ketchup), but we've been very careful with those since they're causing nausea (though so does almost everything, so she still tries sometimes). She says she's been craving cheesesteaks/buffalo cheesesteaks, but she lost interest after a couple of bites in the buffalo wings we got last week because she was craving them. At this point, she says she's getting ""hangry"" because she hasn't had a proper meal in a week.

So I'm wondering if there's anything that I could make that could replicate that sort of ""artificially sour"" flavor. I'm thinking sweet and sour chicken, but also open to other ideas (maybe something with dried Persian limes?). She does not like any sort of seafood, but I think we're willing to eat any other proteins. (And for what it's worth, I think I'm a pretty decent cook.)

Thanks in advance for any suggestions.

QUICK EDIT: Just to clarify since I've seen a few comments about it's OK for her to snack on the candies, I 100% agree. I'm definitely not policing her food in anyway. She's looking for more meal-type foods that she can eat, and in the last week has been especially frustrated that she's not finding anything that she wants. I've always been the primary cook for us, and am more than happy to try new things for her/us. She's definitely still snacking on the candies, but also wants a more fulfilling/nutritious meal during the day.

Edit: for those asking for the recipe, it’s not really a recipe, it’s a “feel” dish that you mess around with until you’re happy. In my experience , it’s best learned by watching someone else make it, not following a recipe. Stanley Tucci’s video on YouTube is good, just a bit short. 

Use 6-7 tbsp  quality olive oil. Slice 3 or 4, depending on your preference, cloves of garlic super thin (remember the prison meal scene in Goodfellas? That thin). It will infuse better but burn easier so be careful! Salt the water until it tastes like the sea. Cook the pasta a hair short of al dente because it will continue cooking when you combine it in the pan with the oil and garlic. Reserve sufficient (I use about 1/2 cup, sometimes 2/3 if it’s being funny) pasta water right before you drain it so it’s really starchy.  Pasta in oil, water in , toss.

Cooking,"yk, it's always 'salt and pepper', the age old standard, default, 'go-to' all purpose seasoning for pretty much anything and everything. at a restaurant you get S&P shakers, practically every savoury recipe, from most cuisines has S&P as part of the seasoning, regardless of the other ingredients and flavours of the dish, when you refer to something being mildly seasoned or using 'basic' seasoning, the 'basic' usually alludes to salt and pepper. i get why salt would be there, since it is essential to enhance and bring out the other flavours of the food, but 'neutral' in the way that salt doesn't really have its own distinct flavour. but why black pepper? when and why and how did 'S&P' become a thing? to clarify, i have no issue with black pepper, i think it's a great spice that enhances the flavour of so many dishes, but i don't think it necessarily goes well with Everything, sometimes it's just unnecessary and sometimes it can definitely be very noticeable and not in a good way, or sometimes a bit too much of it really overpowers the other spices. no other spice other than black pepper is considered a 'standard' default spice ubiquitously across so many different cuisines around the world. take any other spice for instance, like cumin, paprika, cinnamon, none of those are a 'it goes without saying to chuck it into every dish whether it works or not' you wouldn't use them in any and every dish as they have a distinct flavour which impacts the overall taste of the dish. in the same way, so does pepper, so then why, what makes it so special?

Cooking,"Last night i made this https://nomnompaleo.com/post/150016559668/cantonese-crispy-chicken-thighs 


And some roasted kohlrabi with brown rice on the side. I scooped up a little of the left over brothy stuff + vegetables from the pan and put it on the rice (not sure if this still counts as drippings cause of the broth). Everyone loved it but my mom got mad after I explained how i made it taste good. She even told me i have to use no skin no bones chicken next time. (Not to be rude or ungrateful, but her chicken is always incredibly dry). Does anyone know the nutritional value of the stuff on the bottom aswell as the skin? My mom is overweight and likes to be stingy with me when i cook, but her alternative is processed packaged food and deli meat, so how does this meal compare to that?

Cooking,"Thank you. I had no idea Penzey’s existed until a week or so ago. My spice cabinet will never be the same. I tried Sunny Paris on eggs this morning and it was fantastic.

Cooking,"This stuff is like crack. Just got a tin of Za'atar to try and decided to make a sort of pizza with it and holy moly is it good. Where has this been all my life? I need to put this on homemade fries next.  You have to let the seasoning bloom in olive oil and then apply it to your bread.  Its basically like a combination of thyme, sesame seeds, sumac, salt, coriander, cumin, and parsley. The sumac makes it tangy!

Cooking,"Mine is heavy cream and sugar cubes. My mom would never buy them when I was a child because the cream was 'unhealthy' and the sugar cubes were 'too expensive'. Now I keep the cream for that extra dash to add to buttered noodles, or pesto, or soups... and the sugar cubes are just so convenient! I can't get my coffee 'just right' with the sugar bowl, I need 3 sugar cubes, dagnabbit!

Cooking,"**Once** 

Using sesame oil as a cooking oil


Adding corn starch to hot liquids


Adding boiling water to protein powder


Water + hot oil


Forgetting a utensil in the blender


Not cooking down alcohol enough


**All the fucking time**


Forgetting a pan to catch drippings in the oven


Grabbing lid/pan that just came out of the oven with bare hands


Using too small a bowl to prep


Rubbing eyes after handling peppers


Using higher heat than I should because I'm in a hurry, dammit, won't you cook faster? And being dissatisfied with the results (obviously)


Turning the broiler on, not setting a timer (it's just going in there for a sec, why would I need a timer?), fucking off to do the dishes or something, coming back to food a tad darker than I planned",Kitchen mistakes you made once and mistakes you make again and again,t2_sjtt41581,0.97,1365,1722802410.0,1722802410.0,624,running462024,1ek4ojk
