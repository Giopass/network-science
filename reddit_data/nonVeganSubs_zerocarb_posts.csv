zerocarb,"Hey there,

40 y old guy here. Used to be a gym rat in college, basically was eating paleo without really knowing it. For the last few years to a decade I felt sick/drowsy everyday, no energy, always hungry and could not go more than 3-4 hours before having to wat or having hunger pain.

I just tried carnivore for the past 2 months because to me it was close to what I used to do in the past and I figured I had nothing to lose. Well I did lose something: excess weight. At this rate I'll be back to my college weight or better within 2-3 months.

My depression I carried for most of my life is gone.

I don't fall asleep all the time anymore.

I don't feel hungry all the time anymore. I eat once a day.

I basically eat what I always loved (meat).

Now I feel like I can lift a mountain and I'm getting my gym gear and equipment from my storage to start weight lifting and maybe even amateur bodybuilding as I did almost 20 years ago. I'd say my only issue atm are coworkers who tell me I'm going to kill myself following this diet (I don't call it a diet, I see it as a nutrition style), but the one thing they all have in common is they are severely overweight and many of them have diabetes. I don't want to point the obvious, but I figured in a few months to a year my apearence will speak louder than words.",Feeling like I can lift a mountain,t2_14rtvn,0.99,66,1717690727.0,1717690727.0,12,TheEggers,1d9m5m7
zerocarb,"Sometime during this last summer, I passed my 10 year mark of successfully completing my first month of eating this way. Back then, that mattered because we didn't count from our first attempt at eating this way. If we could, I would be able to date my tenure several months earlier. It was a different world back then. This way of eating was virtually unknown. The downside was that you really were going off into the wilderness almost on your own. The upside was that the information was limited to what was known to work. These days, everyone is talking about ""carnivore,"" even though it seems like the majority aren't doing it and don't understand it.  In this post, I am going to take you back. I am going to take you back to the basics. This will tell you what carnivore is and how it is supposed to be done. I'm going to use the words of ""The Bear"" for structure, because he was a modern contemporary example of actually doing it.

Who is the Bear? That's an interesting question. He's not a one-dimensional figure. For our purposes, I will allow him to introduce himself as he did:

>I have been eating the natural human dietary regime for over 47 years now. I do not eat anything whatsoever from vegetable sources. The only things veggie I use are spices. My diet is usually 60% fat and 40% protein by calories. I used to eat 80/20 when younger and about twice as much quantity of meat also, but that seems too much energy at my age, which is 71- even though I am very active.

The Bear found ""The Fat of the Land"" in his early days and started to eat that way. He ate this way until he died in a car accident. While he was still around, he shared his experience and his rules. He had what is normally summed up as 7 rules. At different times, he shared different rules. But, they usually included the same ideas.

From his original thread:

>Eat only from the animal kingdom. Avoid eating carby animal food, like lactose (dairy) and more than a very small, occasional, few ounces of liver.

>Do not measure what you eat and do not worry about variety.

>Do as little cooking of your food as you can tolerate.

>Eat the fatty part preferentially in each meal first, then finish as much of the lean as you want. Leftovers will keep.

>You do not need 'recipes' or 'sample meals' to follow.

>When away from home, no matter if it is a restaurant, family or friends, or business meal, eat only from the animal kingdom, avoid the rest, practice doing this unassumingly and make pleasant, distracting comments if bailed up on it. Learn to politely refuse alcohol.

From ZIOH:

>1- Eat only from the animal world (eggs, fish, red meat and fowl and some dairy are all animal-sourced foods, i.e.: meat).

>2- Eat nothing from the vegetable world whatsoever. (Very small amounts of flavourings such as garlic/chillies/spices/herbs which may be added, are not ‘food’).

>3- On diary: avoid milk and yoghurt (heavy carbs- lactose), use only pure (not ‘thickened’- heavy) cream (read the label), cheese and unsalted butter.

>4- Don’t cook your meat very much- just a little bit on the outside- for flavour- blood-rare or bleu. For this reason I advise against eating pork.

>5- Eat liver and brains only very infrequently- they are full of carbs.

>6- Be sure to have plenty of fat of animal origin at each meal and eat mostly of the fat until you feel you have had enough- you can eat more lean at this point if you like- calories are not important, nor is the number of meals/day. Vegetable oils are not good food.

>7- You do not need any supplements of any kind. Drink a lot of water and do not add salt to anything.

From ""Bear's Words of Wisdom""

>• Eat only food from animals  
• No vegetables  
• Limit liver intake  
• Avoid liquid milk (except for butter and cheese)  
• Eat as much fat as you like  
• Don’t cook your food much  
• Avoid salt  
And the most important one: Eat your meals as a matter of course, don’t waste any time thinking about food–it is merely a way to stay alive, and must not rule your life.  
By the way, for many obese people low carb does not work–only zero carb does (defined as less than 5 g/day).

So, there it is.  If it's not in the above rules, it isn't carnivore or it doesn't matter. Now look carefully, do you see how these rules differ from a lot of the ""carnivore"" plans that people are promoting? Do you see a difference in attitude and approach?

First, ""don't waste time thinking about food."" No recipes or sample meals or daily food guides. Don't measure shit, don't track stuff, don't obsess about purity and details. If you're out to eat, do your best to stick to pure meat, but don't obsess about trace amounts of impurities. That's the path to an eating disorder. Eat like an animal, you are one.  If you happen to end up consuming a trace amount of sugar or flour, while eating out, it's not a huge deal for most people. You move on and your body will be fine.

Second, limit liver and salt consumption. The modern ""gurus"" almost universally try and push over-consumption of both of these up to and way past the point of causing illness. You don't need either, ever. The people pushing these items are making their inexperience and ignorance obvious by putting it on display.

Third, dairy isn't a free food that you can just consume tons of. No milk. Creams and cheeses are more like seasonings than full foods. And butter is fine, but it's not something to cram down your gullet or hide in your coffee to consume extra.

Fourth, seasonings are fine. At least in the trivial amounts you should be using them. It doesn't take a lot to add flavor to meat. So often, I see people freaking out about how they are bored and can't eat. Then I also find out they are doing some super-weird and super-restrictive diet like only beef without any seasonings. That's silly. That's not required. There's no award for dumbest way to be carnivore or hardest time adapting. Actually, the award for hardest time adapting seems to be complete failure to adapt.

That's it folks. It really is. Eat fatty animal meat. Eat often and as much as you want. Stop thinking too much about it. Don't freak out about a little seasoning. Avoid vegetable oils and salt, but you also don't need to freak out and obsess about perfectly avoiding them. If you're thinking about this, you're making it harder than it is. And, yeah, carbs do still count. That's especially true for obese people. And, that means 0-5 g/day or you're going to have a bad time.",Back to the Basics with Bear,t2_9jt9p,0.93,63,1729107882.0,1729107882.0,14,partlyPaleo,1g586uz

It was like a light switched on I've never felt better. It does make me sad thought I can not add salt to any of my food with out having negative results.

zerocarb,"I'm 73 and need to lose about 40 lbs. My doctor suggested the Mediterranean Diet, but it is making me sicker. I found I feel better when I eat more meat.

I had tried Carnivore before, but just jumped into it with no transition, and it made me very,very sick (DUH!), so I just surmised it wasn't for me. I'm ready to try again, but I need to transition very slowly, since my body is used to eating just about all carbs all day long, I have lupus, and because at my age, my body takes longer to adjust to things.

What do you think of this plan?

I want to start at 100 carbs a day, which is much lower than I'm doing now, but probably won't mess me up too much.

Every 4 days I will drop down 10 carbs - don't know where I got that number, but I remember reading somewhere that it takes 4 days for your body to start to adjust to a new food, so it sounded about right.

Once I get to 20 carbs, I'll drop one carb a day until I get to zero.

So that's 2 months of transitioning. I feel like doing this very slowly, I can avoid most of the worst ""keto flu"" symptoms, and not go through what I did on my first try.

zerocarb,"I am posting this in other subreddits, but enjoy and trust this one so I wanted to ask it here, too. I exclusively cook with cast iron and will often crank the heat up on high and cook with leftover animal fat or butter. Is there any negative consequence of doing this? 

  
It is essentially frying the food in a fat, and I feel like I'm trained to think that cooking foods in this way is inherently unhealthy due to deep fried foods that are done with other types of oils. Does the type of oil matter or is this still causing a breakdown of the foods and causing something to happen during the cooking process, such as how trans fats develop and whatnot.

zerocarb,"So from my time doing zero carb/carnivore people always talk about salt as one of the parts of the diet. However, I've been reading through some of the older zero-carb stuff e.g. [https://www.zerocarbhealth.com/the-bear-on-salt/](https://www.zerocarbhealth.com/the-bear-on-salt/) and I've seen that a lot of the older long-term guys don't add salt and seem to do fine.

The other thing I noticed is that the same people don't seem to need electrolytes. Also, it got me thinking that the rise of everyone on carnivore needing electrolytes could be linked to adding all this salt? Perhaps adding extra salt sends everything out of whack? I have learned that everything in the body has a reaction when we do things in excess in one way. 

I also noticed that in the older zero-carb stuff they talk about having patience with teething problems crossing over. e.g. not going straight to electrolytes but waiting things out for the body to adapt. 

So I've decided to do a test and stop adding salt to my diet for the next 1-3 months and see what happens.  Currently, my diet is beef, butter, salt, water and the odd egg yolk if i make burgers.

In my country (brazil), every salt is fortified with iodine.

Since salt is something that over time we tend to use less (and some quit it),

My questions are:

* if i stop salt (as many did), will i have problems with iodine?
* meat alone has enough iodine? (since i eat mostly meat and tallow)
* i saw that cows in some places receive suplementation, but.. how we know? this means that if they dont receive, we get sick? since goiter (dont know if it is the right term. researched on google translate. In brazilian portuguese this disease is called bócio) is a thing.

zerocarb,"Hello. 👋  
I don't have a particular reason for posting, aside from saying hello to everyone.

Maybe this helps someone down the line.

\-------------

I'll start with my current plans going forward, some advice, and then end with my history with zerocarb.

\-------------

Started yesterday. (again)

I find it easier to count the total meals instead of the total days, so where I can, I'll post a quick picture of each meal to [my subreddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/xikini/). I know I'll probably forget to take a picture here and there, and on those meals I'll just write a quick blurb about what I ate.

I've more or less dialed in what I enjoy and can afford to eat.

Basically intending to eat hamburger patties most meals, with 2 meals a week of salmon. Throw some other foods in there if it fancies me

I'm going to put cheese on the hamburger patties to help transition, and then start going with just hamburger patties after that. 

Two reasons there. I've noticed that I don't enjoy the cheese as much recently, and historically I know cheese affects my hunger signals. Keeps the cravings around. oh and thirdly, I want to try with no salt for awhile.

The food choices are mostly down to convenience and cost.

My meal plan is roughly $75/week.

I live in Canada, and the food prices are just dumb. Eye of round is about $20/lb, and going for new york strip / ribeye / porterhouse, you're looking at $34, $52, $47 per pound. So, eating what I can afford mostly.

\-------------

I've been on/off zerocarb since 2019, so here's my advice.

► First week transition is the hardest.  
\-- It never really gets easier, so if you're able to, just stick with it. I promise you'll be happier.

► Staying with this way of eating is mostly a mental challenge.  
\-- If you live alone, I imagine this is quite a bit easier, or having a buddy that's trying to stick to a diet.  
\-- The carb cravings will disappear around week 3.  
\-- After that, the only thing you'll get a craving for is fat. 

I mean, that's basically it aside from the generic advice.

► Salt to taste or not at all.  
► Drink to thirst. Don't force yourself to drink some set amount per day.  
► If looking for food, I just check if the fat:protein ratio by gram is equal or skewed higher towards fat.  
► Roughly 1:1 ratio is 70% of your intake as fat. 2:1 is 80%.  
► Don't force yourself to eat. Just eat when hungry.  
► If your appetite for meat in general plummets, just wait it out. Hunger is a fantastic seasoning.  
► I highly recommend buying an assortment of different meat when first starting out. Figure out what your body enjoys.  
► If you are having toilet trouble.. eat smaller meals, don't render the fat as much and drink less water near meal times.  
► Don't play around with electrolytes. Your body does it on it's own. Let it do it's thing.  
► Any and all symptoms during transition are unique to the person. Honestly until you're like 6 weeks in, just assume strange shit is going to happen. Ask about it if you're concerned, but by and large the response is just going to be 'yeah, that happens to some people and not others. You're fine.'  
► I don't recommend trying the recipes out there to make carnivore bread / pizza / et cetera.  
► I instead recommend to embrace the simple nature of this way of eating instead of attempting to imitate the foods you previously enjoyed.  
► Weight loss is not a goal of this diet. Or at least shouldn't be your primary reason. Eating for health is.  
► I would argue that weight/body normalization is a better description of what happens. You might increase your weight or reduce it, but your body is going to shift towards being healthier. No matter what happens to your weight, in the mirror, you're going to look better.

\-------------

After transition, overwhelmingly the hardest mental challenge for me is also the greatest benefit of the diet, the monotony.

I've said this before, but the way you just exist, with no ups/down in energy.. just a steady even flow. The effortlessness of eating a meal and being able to just continue on with your day. Nothing hurting randomly. Being able to exercise with no pain the next day. Using the bathroom once every 3-4 days instead of 3x a day.

Everything is just.. simple. Streamlined.

There's nothing to complain about.

Somehow this just deals me psychic damage, and I don't know how to cope with it.

\-------------

Alright into the history.

Looking back at my wasted attempts over the years to transition really hurts, but here it is.

I originally started with trying to lose weight on a keto diet. For exactly 2 days, before I jokingly typed into google 'keto without vegetables', and unwittingly found the zerocarb threads.

That was in March 2019, and I went for 5½ weeks, until I went down my parents for vacation, and stupidly thought the transition was easy and I could take a week off and come back onto it after.

Yeah, turns out, not so much. I spent so much mental energy the first time around that I couldn't stick to the diet again.

During those 5½ weeks I had a couple of staggering changes.

The first was brain fog. I was actually at the point where every thought.. had a delay. You're just grasping at the air trying to connect thoughts together, with 200ms delay between them. It's frustrating to explain as you can't really grasp how difficult the brain fog is without experiencing it first-hand, but the thought-line would more often then not just fizzle out, and never make the full connection to what you were attempting to think about. You know the information is there, but there's no way to access it. And if affects everything in your life.

Anyway, I was honestly convinced that I was just getting older, and my brain was simply getting worse. There was no cure. Not even a hint of chance. And then like 4 days in, it was just wiped away as if the problem never existed. I hadn't read about it happening to others, just blindsided.

It's never come back since.

The other notable side effect is for my eyesight. Around 10-14 days in, it becomes extremely sharp, as when I was in my teens, and then over the next week or so it dulls slightly. Still a marked improvement overall, each time I transition, and it's something I've come to look forward to.

Getting a bit of course, let's streamline this a bit.

March 2019, 5½ weeks. On/off never getting past 1 week usually, with a couple months in between attempts, when my health declines enough to force me into trying again. I say trying, but the thought never goes away. I always want to be eating this way, but I keep making excuses.

The main excuse that keeps coming up is the cost. But that's mostly a fallacy, as it's like a $40 difference between a regular diet, and that's only if you never eat out.

At some point you just realize you've tied your emotions up into your lifestyle. It's hard to put into words, but the fact that you're hurting, sabotaging yourself, it draws attention to you, in a negative way. But that's somehow better then people not recognizing you exist? Mind fuckery at it's best.

Sorry, I ramble. Okay, super streamlined.

2019, started. Mostly off with some on diet.  
2020, still on/off, but the time span between attempts gets shorter.  
2021, 2022, 2023, very similar. Some attempts a bit longer. Somewhere in here I got diagnosed with Type 2 Diabetes.  
2024, basically eating zerocarb for 1/3-1/2 of my meals.

Again, not exactly a good track record here. Don't do this. It's frustrating to see the lack of progress over literal years, even though I know the benefits I get.

\-------------

Sorry for it turning into kind of a rant near the end here, but it is what it is.

I guess my final advice is to simply not follow in my footsteps.

Just cut the bullshit and get it over with.

zerocarb,"Welcome to [r/zerocarb](https://www.reddit.com/r/zerocarb).

Our  definition of zerocarb is a carnivorous diet.  We only eat meat and  animal products.  We do not consume plants for nutrients or calories.    Some animal products contain carbs (e.g. dairy), most of those are  acceptable.  Some plant products contain no carbs (e.g. plant oils), and  those are generally not acceptable.

Are you interested in trying a carnivore/zerocarb way of eating?  Do you have simple questions about it? There is a weekly simple questions thread that will be pinned under this post and is the best location for that questions.

The  term 'zerocarb' is historical and dates back to Owsley ""The Bear""  Stanley.  While many members choose to also use other terms, like  carnivore, we will always consider ourselves zerocarb.

If  you are really interested in eating this way, you should read ""The Fat  of the Land"" and ""Bear's Words of Wisdom.""  They are both pinned to the  top of the subreddit in the Free PDFs dropdown.  These are considered  required reading.  If you find some person or website promoting advice contrary to the information in those documents (e.g. Saladino), do not be surprised when we delete it.

We do not have a reddit chat, but there is a place if you want a live chat: [u/LogicalLynx](https://www.reddit.com/user/LogicalLynx) runs it on discord: [https://discord.gg/CR9gPvp](https://discord.gg/CR9gPvp)

# Purpose

This subreddit exists to:

* provide information about the zerocarb way of eating
* provide support for those eating zerocarb and those who want to try or are trying, to eat zerocarb
* provide a community for zerocarbers to interact and share experiences

We are **not**  a debate subreddit.  There are plenty of places for you to discuss the  health benefits of consuming plants.  This is not the place.  We have  heard it all before.  If you are not on a zerocarb diet or transitioning  to one, you are not guaranteed a right to participate here.  Yes, that  means we reserve the right to ban people just for being vegans,  vegetarians, or bots (which don't eat and thus aren't zerocarb). If you  are veg\*n, you may only post in threads tagged ""VEG\*NS ALLOWED.""  If you  post elsewhere, you can be banned.

We do not offer medical advice.  If you are asking for medical advice, your post will be removed.  If you are giving medical advice, your post will be removed.

The  focus of this subreddit is on eating an all-animal-products diet.  Conversations about unrelated topics may be deleted as they are not  appropriate here.  Conversations about other ways of eating, even  conversations about how those ways of eating are misguided, are not  appropriate here.  It is not the purpose of this subreddit to attack or  mock other ways of eating.

This subreddit makes the assumption that you are an intelligent adult and capable of making your own health choices.  We are wary of making recommendations towards children and teens.  If you are interested in an all-meat diet for your child or you are a teen who is interested, we encourage you to work directly with a medical professional.

If you are interested in a meat-heavy diet, one which is almost carnivore but includes some plant foods, which don't cause you issues, *this is not the appropriate place to have those conversations.*  If this describes you, you may have your right to post removed.  There are two potential subreddits that were created to host those discussions.  We have r/carnivorish and r/dirtycarnivores.  Those subreddits are currently small, but you can help them grow.  A responsible person who helps those subreddits become thriving communities will be considered for a moderator position there.

There are  lifestyle choices that you may believe are related to eating this way,  but there is nothing universal here except the avoidance of plant foods.   Those discussions are best when held in subreddits that are  appropriate for them.

# We are not an extreme weight loss subreddit

Weight  normalization will happen with zerocarb.  If you are overweight, you  will reach a healthy weight.  If you are underweight, you will also  reach a healthy weight.   Weight normalization is just a symptom of the  primary goal.  We are about long-term health and wellness.  This isn't  ""extreme keto"" where you get double your weight loss for extreme carb  denial.

We discourage messages  advocating or encouraging food and calorie restriction, even subtle  messages of this manner.  Do not tell people they need to eat less.  Do  not tell people they are eating too much.  Don't tell people they gained  weight because they ate too much or lost weight because they were  eating less.  Don't tell people to eat leaner meat or try fasting.  This is not a debatable subject.  We don't host CICO  discussions here.

From the Bear's Thread:

>I do advise however, that fasting and severely low caloric intake is NOT a very good idea for your health.\[. . .\]The  meat regime does not require fasting, which is what 1100 cal/day is.  You can eat 5000 cal/day and lose bodyfat. You are eating far too  little. Eat 80% (cal) in fat, 20% (cal) in lean. This is instinctive.  Don’t measure. Choose a nice fatty cut of meat, cook very little (blood  rare or bleu), eat mostly of the fat at first, until you don’t feel like  any more fat (built-in response), then eat the lean until satiated.  Save any left-overs in the fridge for later.‘Dieting’ by measuring fat and lean, and restricting caloric intake DOES NOT WORK as a way to acquire and keep a normal body.\[ . . .\]Calorie restriction and/or ‘partial fasting’ are neither necessary nor desirable.

# We are our own Zerocarb Group

We are a cousin to the Facebook groups: [Zeroing In On Health](https://www.facebook.com/groups/zioh2/), [Zero Carb Health](https://www.facebook.com/groups/ZeroCarbHealth/), [Principia Carnivora](https://www.facebook.com/groups/PrincipiaCarnivora/), and [World Carnivore Tribe](https://www.facebook.com/groups/163527891074530/).    But, we are not a direct offshoot of these and exist in our own  right. Many of us are members of one or more of the facebook groups or  other zerocarb groups.  You are encouraged to join other groups that  interest you.  Do not try and argue that we should run our subreddit  differently because these groups may run themselves differently.  We  know that some groups permit discussions that we don't allow here.   Other reddit groups that are distinct but related to ours include r/CarnivoreForum and  [r/carnivore](https://www.reddit.com/r/carnivore/).

# Rules and Behavior

Make yourself familiar with our rules.  The rules are listed in the sidebar of the new reddit.  There are rules listed on the old reddit style, but they are not updated and may not reflect the current rules.  If there is a conflict in the rules, the ones listed on the new reddit are the correct rules.  You are responsible for reading those rules and following them.  Ignorance of the rules is not an excuse for breaking them.

We are pro-health.  That includes sexual health.  Posts which discourage healthy activities, including healthy sexual activities, are not appropriate here.

We usually hand approve all video posts, watching them first.  A video that includes advice or content that is not allowed here will not be approved.  If a video is long, it can take a much longer time to get reviewed.  At times, with heavy moderation loads, we can remove videos without reviewing them first.  Our default reaction is to remove a video, not approve one.

Breaking  any of the above could result in getting your post deleted, future  posts being manually reviewed, and/or being banned from the subreddit.   Using **bold** in your posts is  disallowed by a historical rule.  Breaking this rule usually only  results in our asking you to edit it and remove the bold.   Your posts  can also be removed if they make it obvious that you didn't read this  post first.  ***Please  report posts that you think might violate rules.  The mods don't always  see everything, and we rely on you to alert us to things that we miss.***

# Debatable Subjects

There are some discussion topics where we hold varied opinions.  These include, but are not limited to:

* coffee, tea, and other beverages *\[generally permitted by most\]*
* artificial sweeteners *\[generally not permitted\]*
* salt, spices, and seasonings *\[generally permitted by most\]*
* intermittent fasting and meal timing *\[accepted when it is natural, discouraged when it is artificial and forced\]*
* occasional use of plant oils (like in a mayonnaise) *\[bad stuff, and the least possible amount is the best\]*
* eggs and dairy *\[most people tolerate these well, but they are the first things we think of when people have problems\]*
* organ meats and liver *\[some swear by them, but many people never eat them and are healthy\]*
* grass fed meat or grain finished meat *\[the biggest issue here should be about animal treatment, as the nutritional value of the two categories is insignificant with the amounts we eat\]*

You  will find that many people end up on different sides of the argument  about these.  The *\[text\]* describes the default position of most people.  But, almost all of us would agree that this is arguing  about the last couple percentage points of perfection.  Eating meat (avoiding plant foods) and drinking water gets a person 98% of the way  there.  If spices and cheese help you stick to just eating meat, you're  better off having them than giving up entirely.  In general, we ask that you refrain from suggesting that something from this list is necessary for success.  And, we certainly don't want you telling people to engage in those things were are generally discouraged.

It should be noted that honey is not an animal food.  It is absolutely not tolerated here.  Recommending honey, in any amounts, or trying to argue that it should be permitted will cause the posts to be removed and even first infractions can result in loss of posting privileges.

We  welcome experience reports, even if you struggled or failed.  We  encourage people to try this out and give it a shot.  But, there is a difference between talking about how you're going to try it and asking us how to incorporate plants back into your diet after that trial up.  Trying it and then evaluating is one  thing.   We aren't going to help you plan plant consumption.  Participate here, while you try it.  If your first post is to tell use that you have done it for six months and your left foot exploded and leaked butter all over your couch, you will find us a bit skeptical as to the veracity of your tale.  We don't need you posting ""Goodbye"" posts.

# My post was deleted or doesn't show up

We  get a lot of hate and a bunch of spam here.  If your post doesn't show  up or gets caught in a filter, and you believe this is in error,  feel  free to message the moderators.  If you spot abusive or off-topic posts,  please report them and we will get on top of them as soon as possible.

There is a certain account age and karma, below which your posts will automatically be removed.  We don't post specific numbers, to discourage people from attempting to find ways around them.  Attempting to get around these limitations can result in your account permanently being filtered.  What we will say is that the numbers are not very high and if you participate positively on other subreddits for a couple weeks, you should be fine.

If  you disagree with a post being deleted, you can message the mods and  try and have a reasonable conversation with us.  We allow some moderator  discretion when it comes to approving and deleting posts.  Having an attitude or attacking the moderators will not help you.  It is likely to make us decide against you, and might result in loss of posting privileges here.  Please note the right for moderators to use discretion.  If we do not allow your post, but we did allow a similar post, that does not mean we have an obligation to approve your post. We make no apologies for heavy-handed moderation.  This is a very specific way of eating.  When people try and dilute or change the way we do things, we are not obligated to provide them an area on this subreddit to promote their variations.","READ THIS BEFORE POSTING AND CARNI-CURIOUS [UPDATED Dec 12, 2024] ",t2_9jt9p,0.9,31,1734016590.0,1734016590.0,7,partlyPaleo,1hcna49

Electrolyte imbalances can occur with both deficiencies and excesses of key minerals such as magnesium, potassium, and sodium (often considered as the ""last electrolyte"" in common discussions). Here are signs associated with too little and too much of these electrolytes:

Magnesium
Too Little (Hypomagnesemia):
- Muscle cramps or spasms
- Weakness
- Fatigue
- High blood pressure
- Irregular heartbeat
- Numbness and tingling
- Seizures
- Mood changes, like agitation and anxiety

Too Much (Hypermagnesemia):
- Nausea and vomiting
- Lethargy
- Muscle weakness
- Urinary retention
- Low blood pressure
- Irregular heartbeat
- Cardiac arrest in severe cases

Potassium
Too Little (Hypokalemia):
- Weakness and fatigue
- Muscle cramps and twitching
- Muscle aches and stiffness
- Abnormal heart rhythms (arrhythmias)
- Digestive problems
- Tingling and numbness

Too Much (Hyperkalemia):
- Fatigue and weakness
- Numbness and tingling
- Breathing difficulties
- Chest pain
- Palpitations or irregular heartbeats
- Nausea and vomiting

Sodium
Too Little (Hyponatremia):
- Nausea and vomiting
- Headache
- Confusion
- Loss of energy and fatigue
- Restlessness and irritability
- Muscle weakness, spasms, or cramps
- Seizures
- Coma

Too Much (Hypernatremia):
- Thirst
- Weakness
- Nausea and vomiting
- Confusion and irritability
- Severe cases can lead to seizures and coma

zerocarb,"# What Should I Read First?

Obviously, this FAQ is a good start.  Other recommended reading is [The Fat of the Land](http://justmeat.co/docs/the-fat-of-the-land-vilhjalmur-stefansson.pdf) (should be required reading), [Bear's Words of Wisdom](http://justmeat.co/docs/the-bear.pdf) (also pretty important), and [Strong Medicine](http://justmeat.co/docs/strong-medicine-blake-donaldson.pdf) (optional but has some good information).  All three of those are available as PDFs from those links.  They are listed in order of how beneficial they are.  I have rarely seen a question that was not addressed in The Fat of the Land.

# I'm sorry but the idea of a zerocarb diet having book requirements sounds like ultimate gatekeeping to me.

This way of eating has a history and that history defines what it is and how it is done.  When someone has questions, they are usually already answered in those sources.  I did not say that any of the books are  required.  I said one 'should' be required, another was pretty  important, and one was optional.  No one is being forced to do anything.   It helps to read the books.  But, we answer the questions of those who don't.

# How Long Should I Try?

You should commit to a full 30 days and 100 individual meals, whichever is greater.  During this time, absolutely no deviation or cheating allowed.  If you cheat, or deviate, restart both counts.

# Should I Slowly Reduce Carbs or Jump Right In?

Some of the other moderators here often will tell people to go do keto, paleo, or some other low-carb plan first.  I don't agree with them.  But, you can go try that.  Your first day of zerocarb will not start until after you completely drop everything though.  I say to just commit and get through it.  Stefansson (The Fat of the Land) says the same thing.

>Beginning the meat diet gradually, trying to make the change less  painful, would be about as considerate as chopping a dog's tail off  gradually, by inches.  \[. . .\] I have seen to it, irrespective of  this token hoarding, that the men changed abruptly from the mixed to  the straight meat diet, the saved-up delicacies being strictly saved,  never used in any tapering off process.

# What Can't I Eat?

You can't eat anything that isn't from the animal kingdom.  That means no plant foods, no artificial sweeteners (nothing sweet actually), no fiber supplements, no alcohol, and no plant oils/fats.  This includes honey.  Some people confuse themselves into thinking honey is an animal product.  It is not.  It isn't even something debatable.  Honey is not allowed in any amounts in the carnivore/zerocarb way of eating.

# OK, What Can I Eat?

You can have any kind of meat.  You do not need to stick with beef.  If you like pork, eat pork.  If you are craving some chicken, eat some chicken.  The same goes for everything else: rabbit, fish, lamb, etc.  You can eat high-fat and low-carb dairy.  That's butter, hard cheeses, and creams.  Dairy can cause issues for people, it should not be considered a main course.  It is more like a seasoning or a side.  Some cheese on a burger is fine.  An 8 ounce block of cheese by itself?  That is not fine.  Eggs are fine also.

# What About Milk?

Don't drink milk. You are a grownup.  As people age, milk become less and less appropriate for humans. Young children can drink milk.

After you had adapted, if you wish to try to include milk, you can give it a shot.  Some people have no problems and find it benefits them.  But, during the getting started phase, no milk.  And, the majority of people never go back to it.

# Do I Need to Eat My Meat Raw?

Nope.  Cook your meat however you like it.

# Do I Need to Eat Organs or Grass-Finished Meat?

Nope.  Eat the meat you enjoy and can afford.  There is no need to ever eat organs or grass-finished meat.  You really do not need to concern yourself with it when just starting.

# What About Seasonings, Salt, and Spices?

Spices are allowed (although make sure sugar is not an ingredient).  Plants are allowed as seasonings and medicines.  A light sprinkling of some spices will not be a problem for most people, although some people do have issues.  Do not get too aggressive with it, light is better.   Meat is delicious, it does not need much to enhance the flavor.  Salt is something you can consume to taste.  There are people who insist you need extra and others who insist that you need none.  Stefansson says none.  The Bear says none.  Most people feel better with salt, even extra salt, at the start.  It is not a deal breaker.

# What About Electrolytes? You don't mention them and lots of people on the sub talk about them.

It is covered under seasonings and  salt. Short answer, historical practice has considered salt to be  problematic and it was not permitted. People adapted fine and we're  successful without using any salt or electrolytes (even during the  adaptation phase).  Stefansson even refused to take it with him on the long journeys and what little they had ran out at the same time they went from a mixed diet to a zerocarb one cold-turkey.

Lots of people  mention it. Sure. Lots of people believe they need to consume a bunch  and worry about balancing electrolytes. They will insist they had  symptoms that only resolved because they increased salt or added  magnesium or whatever. Or they insist they get certain symptoms if they  cut or reduce these things. It will never cease to amaze me, the  powerful effect that beliefs can have on the body.

In the end, salt is probably not super harmful.  If it makes you feel better and sleep well at night, have some extra salt. It is not a deal breaker.

# What About Coffee or Tea?

Coffee and tea are not good for you.  But, coffee is generally well tolerated and accepted by many.  Stefansson allowed it, the Bear allowed it, and many long-term carnivores will still drink it.  It falls into the category of plants as flavoring and/or drugs.  You can keep it for the start.  If you do, it is highly recommended that you try going without it at some point in the future.  Tea tends to be harder on the kidneys and body.  A cup should be fine.  But, but not too much.

If you drink either, some cream is fine.  Real cream and not creamer.  No sweeteners of any kind.  No butter, no coconut oil or MCTs (plant oils are not allowed).  Absolutely no Bullet-Proof coffee monstrosities.

# What About Alcohol?

No.  Definitely not at the start.  And, it is not a great idea after.  If you can't stop drinking for 30+ days while you get through the 30 days / 100 meals, you have bigger problems with alcohol than you do with your food.  Fix that first.

# How Much Should I Eat / When Should I Eat?

More than you expect and more often than you think.  The absolute minimum recommended amount (from Strong Medicine) is 3 meals a day of 6 ounces of lean and 2 ounces of fat.  That is equivalent to 3x8oz of (75%/25% ground beef).   One and a half pounds over three meals is about 1,995 calories and 109 grams of protein.  This is the FIRM minimum allowed (small women might get prescribed and eat this amount).  Eating more at any of the three meals was allowed.  For larger people more was encouraged.  Eating less than this was failure to follow the protocol.

Ideally, you will attempt to follow a similar eating protocol and plan at the start.

We   strongly discourage intermittent fasting during the first days.  We know that many zerocarbers who have done this for a while will eat 1-2   meals a day, but very few of them started there.  The first purpose of   eating this way is to relearn your body's signals and needs.  You  should  eat when you are hungry and as much as you want.  For people who  have a  history of calories restriction, IF, fasting, or other stuff  like that,  you might have messed up your ability to know when you are  hungry.  Try  and eat several times during the day.  Have at least two  bites of the  food.  If you eat a couple of bites and really aren't  interested, put it  away and come back to it later.  You will often be  shocked to learn  that you were hungry.  This has other benefits.   First, it reduces  cravings for the foods you shouldn't eat.  If you are  full, you are less  likely to fall to temptation.  Second, it provides  ample nutrients for  your body to heal and get back on track.  Third,  you are sending signals  to your body that food is ample and there is no  shortage.  There's no  need to preserve excess fat, energy is available  for the taking whenever  desired.  You may not lose super quickly  eating this way, although many  people do still lose a lot, you will get  healthy and reach a healthy  weight this way.  Remember, you can starve  yourself thin; but, you will  never starve yourself healthy.

Our position on IF is perfectly summed up by The Bear.

>It   is perfectly ok to only eat one large meal/day, like a three pound   steak- but it is likewise just as ok to eat as many as six. If you are   working out and trying to gain muscle mass, eat six smaller steaks   rather than one or two big ones. I have eaten as much as four or five    pounds of steak in a day- and as little as one or two, it matters   not--but if you ingest less calories than you are burning, you will lose   muscle mass as well as bodyfat. If you ingest more than you need, the   body discards the excess--quite different than is the case with carbs.

# I Can't  Eat Enough At My OMAD!

OMAD is a totally different way of eating from carnivore. Let go of that idea and eat multiple times.

There are zerocarbers who end up  eating one huge meal a day, but it is not everyone. Lots of people end  up with two or three meals a day. Some feel best with even more. But the  number of meals does not matter. All of them eat when their body  requests food. All of them eat enough to fuel their body well.

If  you read the above, the minimum amount for starting out should be three  meals of 8 ounces or more of fatty meat. After you have a few months  under your belt and have learned to listen to your body when it asks for  more or is not asking for food, then you can try something else.

# How Will I Poop Without Fiber?

You   will poop again.  It might slow down.  It might speed up.  Do not  trust  a fart.  One frequent adaptation issue is very loose movements.   It's  not uncontrollable diarrhea, but it is very watery.  These things   normalize in time.  But, you will almost never fart.  If you think you   have to fart, try going to the bathroom.  You won't regret that   precaution.

# Do I Need to Take Supplements? What About Medications?

You do not need supplements.  You can continue to take medications prescribed to you.  Be aware that your body may become more sensitive to the medication and require less as time goes on.  Work with your doctor.

# Do I Need to Buy Anything?

You do not need anything to eat this way.  Do not go out and buy ketone strips, glucose monitors, coaching or anything else.  There is no need to pay for any books.  We have the main ones available for free.  There are no supplies you need to buy, other than the meat that you can afford and enjoy.  It is not  wrong to buy someone's book, but you are not going to be more successful because you do.

Be wary of people trying to sell you something.  There is no need to pay $120 a month for coaching.  We provide all the information you need here for free.  Actually, all the best, most experienced, and helpful zerocarbers offer their help for free and are out there.  Many of us have been helping others for years, for free.  You don't need to buy your meats from any specific supplier.  There are no supplements or vitamins that we are selling.  In fact, if anyone offers advice that also includes something you should buy, that is a pretty good sign that you shouldn't trust them.

# Who Do I Trust?

You will frequently see people with different opinions arguing on here.  People will tell you that you need to eat liver, fast, stare at the sun, rub your left foot counterclockwise under a full moon, etc.  Often this advice will be contradictory.  When in doubt, compare that advice to The Fat of the Land, The Bear's Words of Wisdom, and maybe Strong Medicine (if you haven't already got an answer by then).  If none of those address it, chances are it is not that important.  Look for people who have been doing this for a while and what they do, although be careful.  Some people lie about how long they have done it.  Use your common sense and be willing to test things yourself.  Just because we eat this way does not mean we reject all science, common sense, and logic.  Staring at the sun and arguing that the Earth is flat does not make you extra-zerocarb, it makes you extra-special (and not in a good way).

# Will I Get Scurvy?

No.  Read The Fat of the Land for more details.

# Will I Die?

Yes.  You are human, and all humans will eventually die.  But, this diet won't kill you.  This is the diet meant to keep you alive and healthy.  It will not make you immortal.  It won't make you immune from all disease or a super-hero.  It will give your body the best fighting shot at health.

# What If I Have a Special Medical Issue or Condition?

First, always work with your medical professional.  They are aware of your specific situation in a way that people on the internet are not.  For people with histamine issues and other issues with severe allergies, it may require cutting all spices out and seeking fresher meat than normal (start with spices).  People without gallbladders might need to eat more often to avoid overloading on fat.   Some people may find that they react to eggs and dairy and they need to reduce even those down to zero.  If possible, try and complete a run before tweaking, but also be aware of your specific circumstances.

zerocarb,"I'm trying carnivore as an elimination diet for a while to see if it helps with various chronic issues.
My initial plan was to stick to beef, either fried in tallow or high-fat cuts fried in their own fat.

I’ve never really liked the taste of beef that much, but I thought I could push through.

However, when I bought beef from a butcher, the flavor was way too intense and bloody, and I couldn’t finish my plate.

Apparently the supermarket beef I’ve eaten in the past is mixed with cereals, vegetables, starch, herbs, and other additives, which probably masked the taste.

Now I’m considering chicken as my main protein source. I know it’s usually discouraged in carnivore for being too lean, but I could fry it in beef tallow to add fat. I’ve also read about concerns with chicken being high in PUFA, but does that really matter if I’m only planning to do this diet for a few weeks before reintroducing other foods?

Or, are there maybe any ruminant meats that taste milder and, well, less meaty than beef?

Lastly, would adding eggs be a good idea to compensate for chicken’s deficiencies? Being an elimination diet I want to keep the number of foods as low as possible, but eggs seem unlikely to be the cause of inflammation or symptoms, right?

Any advice or thoughts would be greatly appreciated!

During the past month I lost 10kg, but I gained 1.5kg during the past week. My physical activity has increased during the past week. I've also been having problems with belching. Didn't have those before.

During my first time, I was eating the same stuff as I am now. I don't know what I might be doing wrong. ",I'm gaining weight,t2_12dtx9,0.88,6,1717161535.0,1717161535.0,4,gafanhotojudeu,1d4vff7

zerocarb,"TLDR: Started carnivore a few days ago (four I think) but no keto flu symptoms. 

Perhaps I misunderstood the deal with the carnivore diet but I thought that by eliminating all carbohydrates from my diet I would thus enter ketosis. I haven't measured my ketone levels (and won't be, simply due to the cost) but am almost certain that I am not in ketosis (at least not yet). I have no symptoms that are expected from keto flu. I honestly feel basically the same overall as I did before I started, although I have had a mild headache since beginning and have noticed that I felt worse as time went on until earlier today and I've been improving since then. 

Am I doing something wrong? Should I have started keto before switching to carnivore or would that not have made a difference? Any advice, tips, or tricks helps a lot. I'm also pretty new to the ketogenic and carnivore diets so if I misunderstood something, please point it out.

zerocarb,"  
I went (medically assisted) Keto in 2016 with extreme calorie restriction. I went from 330lbs to 240lbs in 4 months. over the next 4 years I ""yo-yoed"" up and down. In 2020 I decided to try it on my own. I went from 250lbs to 300lbs. I consumed way too many calories--especially nuts & keto snacks. I was constantly exhausted, depressed, impulsive, compulsive, obsessive and anxious. Sleep Study showed severe Apnea.  
  
2 weeks ago I went from ""keto"" to Carnivore. I noticed occasional better sleep and occasional energy boosts. I started working out 3 days a week for 30 min. with free-weights. My wife said I still snore but very quietly. 7 days ago I cut out Energy Drinks (which was about 4-5/day). As expected, I felt tired and foggy. 4 days ago, I went Lion Diet (Except added butter to supplement the lean cuts). I eat about 16-20oz 2x/day. I also took about 5 ""male enhancement"" supplements 2 days ago (we're trying to conceive). Those gave me severe brain-fog, head and back aches, and a congested nose.  
  
While I don't have the energy boost I hear about, i also don't feel as exhausted as I did before. I've also noticed my depression, O.C.D. and anxiousness have diminished to manageable levels.  
  
However, according to the scale, I've lost 1lb. According to the tape measure, I've lost .5""-.75"". I tested glucose today 3 hours after my meal and it was 9.6mmol/L. I tested Ketones and barely got to .5mmol/L at 4.5 hours after the meal. I'm very confused by these results. am I doing something wrong? There's a lot of contradiction: (""ignore calories, they're irrelevant""; ""no, no, count calories, they matter"", etc.). I'm hoping I just need to be patient.

zerocarb,"Hi, my wife is expecting and we’ve already been talking about making our own baby food when the day comes since it’s just blended up real food anyways. I’ve been zerocarb for 2 months and she’s still omnivore. I was wondering how early is it safe to introduce meat into the baby’s diet? This isn’t a question about babies being carnivore, because they’ll get all nutrients from us including carbs to grow. Most baby food recipes are something along the lines of mashed potatoes, carrots, peas, light seasoning, and I’m sure that will do for a while, but when does the steak come in? I think it’s straight away if it’s pureed but she thinks it’s 6 months after solids. Thanks",Making baby food?,t2_82xuum8u,0.67,2,1706485284.0,1706485284.0,4,HovercraftForeign591,1adgsdd

zerocarb,"I know it's not carnivore, but I found a little hack for those missing the texture/taste of potatoes.

Carnivore potato = Curry powder + Ghee

* **Curry powder**



    Ingredients: Coriander, Chilli, Cumin, Fennel, Turmeric, White Pepper, Cinnamon, Black Pepper, Cardamom, Star Anise, Nutmeg, Bay Leaf, Clove 

\*\*Make sure to check there is no added salt, flour and nasties.

\*\*Can be obtained from the International food aisle at the grocery store. Or perhaps an Asian grocer.

Get the one specifically for Meat curry, if possible.

* **Ghee**



    Ingredients: 100% butter oil/ butter fat

\*\*I recommend the brand Q.B.B as there's a cleaner, less-processed taste as compared to typical Indian ghee.

**On to the actual Recipe:**  
1) Scoop a few tablespoons of room temperature ghee into a palm-sized dish.  
2) Top off with a few pinches of curry powder. (maybe 2tsp?)  
3) Mix with a teaspoon, until it reaches the consistency of mashed potato. (\~3 seconds?)  
4) Enjoy!","Little hack for those missing ""potatoes"" ",t2_gan0pc2c,0.43,0,1719738608.0,1719738608.0,23,Untitled_poet,1drxffj
