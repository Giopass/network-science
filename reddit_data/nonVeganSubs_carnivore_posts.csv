carnivore,"In mid-January, I (59M) experienced a mild heart attack. They found 99% blockage in my left anterior descending artery, AKA ""The Widow Maker."" They applied a stent and sent me on my way. I began eating carnivore the last week of January.

I began at 310 lbs with type 2 diabetes. My A1c was 8.6. I was weak, and could barely walk around the house.

As of today, 

\- I weigh 293. I've lost 4-1/2 inches around my belly. 

\- I fit into pants I hadn't worn in a year and a half.

\- I walk 2-1/2 miles a day and began sprinting once a week last week. I sprint on a dead treadmill right now.

\- my blood sugars are completely under control. My average glucose over the last three weeks is 109. I use a continuous glucose monitor.

\- the bloat is gone. I can wear regular socks instead of compression socks without cankles at the end of the day. First time in 4 years.

I'm excited and curious to see what happens at 6 months.

carnivore,"I've been carnivore for 5+ years (keto for 15 years). I wanted to bust the myth that we need carbs for energy. 
In September 2023 | completed 5 marathons in 5 days completely fasted. Nothing but water and salt for 5 days.
The key was to strictly adhere to a carnivore diet and make my metabolism become fat adapted. This unlocked 50x more energy than if I relied on carbs.
I can vouch for the fact that on carnivore, your energy levels will skyrocket!

Biggest benefits for me so far:



- Sleep like a baby.    It took a couple months I think for my body to fully adapt.  But now I sleep great and wake up early and energetic.


- Energy Levels are great and consistent throughout the day. 


- Mental Health:  Anxiety and Depression is gone.   I actually want to leave my house now and do things.  Confidence is up and have noticed I have an easier time communicating and recalling information quickly.


- My wife says…….  I never Snore anymore.


I started this telling my self I’d try 30 days and see how I feel,  and today I have no interest in stopping.   I’ve lost weight before and gained it back again.   It’s been a struggle.


I’m mainly eating Beef Eggs Butter Bacon Salt and Water.   Occasional chicken and pork.     Occasionally have a low calorie beer or two in social situations.  ( once a month ). That would be the only “cheat” I’ve done.  I also went cold Turkey on caffeine the day I started.   Only water/carbonated water to drink.   I mainly listen to my body,   I eat 1-2 meals a day.   If I’m hungry during lunch time,  I have lunch.  If not I just eat a good sized dinner.  If I want a snack, I have one.

carnivore,"Started carnivore in March. Dropped 20# quickly. Male attention went up.

Then this summer I started eating carbs again. Still prioritizing meat but slipping back into eating some type of carbs every day.

After a few weeks of this, I noticed male attention had gone down. I had gained only 2# but my facial features weren't as sharp - face was puffy. I also noticed energy and endurance tanked.

Cleaned up diet and literally within a week, I was back to getting the male gaze again.

I know it's helped me add muscle so my body just looks better (even though I still need to lose 10-15.)

carnivore,"TLDR: from paralyzed to high level athlete.

I see a lot of people who are skeptical of the diet and think of it as a short-term thing to lose weight. Many also think it’s not healthy or sustainable in the long run.

I’m posting here to let everyone see that it’s healthy and sustainable to do it long-term.

I’ve been carnivore for more than 5 years and was keto for a year or two before going carnivore. Here’s my story:


Health Transformation:

I was diagnosed with Guillain-Barré Syndrome (GBS) in 2016 at 23 years of age and was fully paralyzed with some difficulty breathing. I was hospitalized for 2 weeks and received IVIG treatment. It took me around 2 months to walk independently again and around 2 years to recover enough to be fully independent. During this time, I experienced a fast initial recovery, followed by a plateau with persistent weakness, tingling sensations, neurological pain, and muscle spasms.


Dietary Changes:

To address these lingering issues, I first went keto, eliminating glutens, lectins, grains, and legumes. This brought immediate improvements, allowing me to stop painkillers and reducing spasms and pain. Then I transitioned to a carnivore diet, and within a few weeks, I was completely normal.


Athletic Performance:

After fully recovering, I started rock climbing and reached a high level in the sport.(at least high level for me 7A Boulder and 7b sport lead outdoors)

Before the carnivore diet, I struggled with basic activities like climbing stairs. A few months into the carnivore diet, I was able to deadlift 100 kg at a bodyweight of 54 kg without much training.


Current Status:

Now at 30, I’m as strong and healthy as I’ve ever been. I continue to follow the carnivore diet and engage in high-level athletic activities like climbing and bouldering.


I hope my story can inspire others to keep their morale high and hope for the best.

carnivore,"We frequently get comments or posts from people asking us to defend this way of eating, convince them that they should eat like this, or explain why they can't have vegetables. In general, we just don't do that. We're not here to convert anyone. We are here to explain how to do this, not why. If you want to know why, ""The Fat of the Land"" gives some reasons and ""Strong Medicine"" gives a bit more from a sensible medical reason. The truth be told, there are almost as many reasons for doing this as there are people who are going it. If you need someone here to convince you that lettuce is bad, because otherwise you're going to eat lettuce, just eat the lettuce. You won't be eating this way, but you're not hurting us. One of the requirements for being a mod here is that we don't profit from this way of eating. None of us earn money coaching, selling products, or anything else. If a mod decided to start offering such services, we would ask them to step down. For that reason, there's no incentive for anyone here to convince someone to do anything.

In a way, I like to think of this way of eating like a beautiful spring high up a mountain path. We've found it. We're here to tell you how to get to it. But, it's not our spring and we don't benefit or suffer depending on if you get to it or not. You might believe that you have found a spring that is perfect for you, and expect us to convince you that our spring is better. We don't care. If you are happy with where you are, then stay there. Maybe you're interested in our spring, but you don't want to follow our directions. Instead of going left at the big boulder in the path, you think going right is better for you. That's cool. The path itself is wonderful. You'll not be going to the spring, but you are free to choose your own path.

carnivore,"This is a fantastic interview with UK physician Dr David Unwin.   

 It is extraordinary what Dr. Unwin has done in the 12 years since a  patient of his told him that she had put her T2D into remission with low  carb.   

Prior to that, Dr. Unwin was ready to think about early retirement.  He was discouraged after having seen the standard of care do little to  change the course of prediabetes and T2D over the course of a quarter  century.   

 By focusing on avoiding sugars and starches, which quickly convert to sugars,  Dr Unwin has found that  about 25% of people with T2D in his practice  achieved drug-free remission and 93% achieve full remission if caught at  the prediabetes stage. The ones who don't achieve full drug-free  remission are still able to decrease their medications.   

 It's the reason we encourage people here to bring along their  doctors ;D rather than engaging in doctor bashing. The system is  completely overloaded right now and it is bad for the doctors and nurses  too.   

 Changing how they practice improves their lives as well as the lives  of their patients -- instead of seeing progressive decline, they see  improvement even remission in their patients' prediabetes and T2D. Their  patients come back happy and often with other chronic problems put into  remission too.   

 In the US right now,  ""The United States government spends more on  diabetes... than the entire USDA budget""  --Agriculture Secretary Tom  Vilsack.   

 About 1% of the US budget is spent on dialysis alone. The rate of  prediabetes keeps going up, it's about 50% of the adult population in  California iirc, and if not put into remission, the amount of dialysis  needed in the future will be even higher. That amount is what is covered  by the government, there is also the amounts being paid by private  insurance companies.   

 And that is only one of the possible effects from chronic progressive prediabetes/T2D.   

 It's untenable.   

 The insurance companies can see this. It's one of the reasons Swiss  Re has partnered with BMJ to look at how the field of public health  could have got it so wrong for so long, and how to fix it. (Swiss Re is a  reinsurer, they insure the insurance companies)   

 ""They are the only ones with a similar power to the drug companies.  So I'm actually working with a few insurance companies because they are  paying and they know that life expectancy is dropping internationally,  they know that multiple morbidity is claiming people. I see big pharma  and big food claiming more and more lives. But there is hope. There is  hope.""   

 Dr Unwin talks about the different types of evidence, and how  important it is to have approaches which roll out well in practice.  The RCTs which he relied on for the previous way he practiced, were not based on the same type of population he sees in practice and the approaches didn't roll out well.

**TLDR** : I’m bedbound sick with autoimmune disease and nerve damage from an injury. Hoping carnivore will help. Quite fragile and never eaten meat…how should I begin carnivore? 

So basically the title. I’ve been a lifelong vegetarian. I’m not like vegans so have never really gone in about it, I sometimes forget I’m even eating differently. It’s just my parents were vegetarian so it’s just habit for me, like not eating olives or something. I don’t see eating meat as particularly bad, if anything I think it’s likely pretty good for humans. I’ve always eaten alongside my meat eating family for practically every meal I’ve ever eaten.

That said, meat does repulse me when it comes to actually eating it. It just feels gross, like I’m eating a dead body (which I guess is accurate). As I say, it’s not a conscious thing, it’s irrational. 

As for my health, it’s a long story. I was in peak condition until 3 years ago, cycling to work, climbing, 10km runs etc then I had a neck injury and my autonomic nerves got damaged. It triggered autoimmune disease in my joints and now I’m literally falling apart. The joints becoming loose led to further nerve damage as my upper cervical spine began to become unstable. Cut to now and I’ve been bedbound for two years, barely able to keep drinking and eating to stay alive.

So I heard carnivore can be good for this sort of thing but I’m aware I’m fragile and my body has never eaten meat before.

carnivore,"I started carnivore diet out of desperation three and a half months ago. 

I’d been 55-60kg from adulthood, right through to until my late 30s. Once I started taking mood stabilisers, my weight skyrocketed. I’m 163cm tall and weighed 110kg at my heaviest. I was pre-diabetic, had PCOS and sleep apnea. 

I managed to lose all the weight on a keto diet, but my health didn’t seem to improve even with the 50kg weight loss. Although many of the aches and pains cleared up, it seemed like my health was actually getting worse. I’m not exaggerating when I say I could feel my body breaking down. 

The worst part for me was that, after losing all the weight, my pre-diabetes became T2 diabetes. The doctor wanted me taking insulin, but I just knew that would be the literal death of me. I knew I wouldn’t be able to keep the weight off and that I’d spend my life sick and fat. 

There were a plethora of other conditions that either didn’t resolve with the weight loss, or actually sprung up afterwards. 

But in the past few months, the following changes have happened for me (in chronological order):

• IBS symptoms resolved

• Haemorrhoids resolved

• Hormonal/cystic acne resolved

• Period returned

• GERD resolved

• T2 diabetes completely reversed 

• Sleep apnea resolved

• Beginnings of body recomposition (more defined waist, perkier boobs and butt)

• Cracked heels now healed and the skin is softening

carnivore,"Been on carnivore for 2 months since January 8th and the weight loss has been amazing. 

This is despite 2 vacations, one long weekend in Florida and a 2 week road trip in Spain as well as various birthdays and family functions. 

Can’t say that there have been no challenges in terms of finding the right food especially when traveling but it’s definitely been easier than I would have expected. 

The restrictive nature of it actually makes it easier for me. I’ve been on keto before (lost 100+ pounds and gained it all back during Covid lockdowns) and the biggest issue have been all of the “keto friendly” packaged foods. I am not saying they aren’t keto friendly but the wide variety of sweets, even sugar free ones, made it harder, not easier. 

In the past 2 months it’s been easier to just say no to anything that doesn’t fit the bill than to “cheat” with all of the keto friendly snacks out there. This is especially important since a lot of them say they’re friendly but are not really. They all sneak in terrible sweeteners like maltitol and you tell yourself that the package says friendly so it must be and it throws you out of ketosis. 

It turns out that snacking on Jamon, dry salamis and amazing cheeses in Spain is a lot more satisfying than grabbing a slightly more convenient breakfast bar with a whole list of unnatural ingredients. 

I even ordered an entire leg of jamon after returning from my trip. 19lbs of meaty and fatty goodness :)

I thought I’d be bored with the limited variety of foods but in reality I look forward to it every day. 

I’ve already made a post about cured pork fat (salo) I now eat for breakfast daily with a variety of cheeses and 2 months later I wake up craving it more and more :)

Sharing food is an inherently social activity, and if you don't accept people's food you will, more often than not, come across as less warm and enthusiastic while around them.

I get this might sound a bit doomery and whiny, because I don't have any real solutions. I just think it's worth acknowledging how difficult this can be. I know quite a few people who fully agree with this diet but would just never fully stick to it because they are extremely extraverted people.

Ultimately I accept I have to sacrifice some social engagements in order to focus on improving my health, but it is hard and it still does suck.",Hardest part about this diet is still social engagement,t2_qp5boe1g,0.97,109,1723515096.0,1723515096.0,101,Carnivorone,1eqwb61

I noticed a very obvious thing that most people don't ever think about, diet is VERY important for attractive features, if someone was fed a nutritious diet when young and avoid sugary, artificial things they tend to have a symmetrical face, well developed  jaw, straight strong teeth, vivid eyes and skin, thick hair, higher stature, and many more.

I noticed my face and body changed completely and people also told I look more attractive, I gained muscle so easily without even doing alot of exercise and my jawline is bigger which is a surprise.

The calories in/out model is extremely outdated. It’s not how many calories you consume that matters, it’s how many of the calories you consume that you metabolise that matters, and your insulin levels are the biggest determining factor in how many calories you eat get metabolised.
Some studies that I can’t link but can give you the names of demonstrating this:
“The effect of two energy-restricted diets, a low-fructose diet versus a moderate natural fructose diet, on weight loss and metabolic syndrome parameters: a randomized controlled trial”
https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/21621801/
This study showed that even when calories were the same, participants eating a moderate amount of fruit lost more weight than participants eating even a small amount of refined sugars. Again, calories were the same, but weight loss was different.
“A low-carbohydrate as compared with a low-fat diet in severe obesity”
https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/12761364/
Participants on a low-carb diet without caloric restriction lost more weight than participants on a high-carb diet with caloric restriction. The low-carbers also saw superior improvements in their fasting insulin levels and triglycerides, even after amount of weight lost was accounted for.
“Effects of low-carbohydrate vs low-fat diets on weight loss and cardiovascular risk factors: a meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials”
https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/16476868/
This system review determined low carb diets without caloric restriction are at least as effective as high carb diets with caloric restriction for weight loss even after 1 year
“Metabolic impact of a ketogenic diet compared to a hypocaloric diet in obese children and adolescents”
https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/23155696/#:~:text=Conclusions%3A%20The%20ketogenic%20diet%20revealed,alternative%20for%20children's%20weight%20loss.
Again, low carb without caloric restriction resulted in more weight loss than caloric restriction
“Comparison of energy-restricted very low-carbohydrate and low-fat diets on weight loss and body composition in overweight men and women”
https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC538279/
This study found that men and women on low carb keto diets lost more weight than those on a low fat diet despite the men eating 300 more calories every day (both groups were having their calories restricted though)
They used DEXA scans to confirm it was body fat and not water weight
“A randomized trial comparing a very low carbohydrate diet and a calorie-restricted low fat diet on body weight and cardiovascular risk factors in healthy women”
https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/12679447/
This study compared women on a low fat diet with caloric restriction and women on a low carb diet without caloric restriction. Both improved blood pressure, lipids, fasting glucose and fasting insulin at 3 and 6 months equally, but the low carb women lost more weight. The study concluded low carb didn’t increase CVD risk.
“Metabolic effects of weight loss on a very-low-carbohydrate diet compared with an isocaloric high-carbohydrate diet in abdominally obese subjects”
https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/18174038/
Very low-carb high-fat produced superior weight loss results than low-fat high-carb even when calories were matched
“Effects of a low carbohydrate diet on energy expenditure during weight loss maintenance: randomized trial”
https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30429127/
This RCT that showed that calories from protein increased participants’ metabolic rate whereas calories from carbs slowed it because of the different hormonal responses each macronutrient elicits, meaning just eating more protein and fewer carbs will have your body burning more calories more quickly
“Breakfasts Higher in Protein Increase Postprandial Energy Expenditure, Increase Fat Oxidation, and Reduce Hunger in Overweight Children from 8 to 12 Years of Age”
https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/26269241/
This study found a high protein breakfast compared to a high carb one lead increased fat burning and energy expenditure and reduced hunger
""The role of energy expenditure in the differential weight loss in obese women on low-fat and low-carbohydrate diets”
https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/15598683/
This study was done by some researchers who previously found that women on a low carb diet lost more than twice as much weight as those following a low fat diet over 6 months despite reported calories being the same. They ran the study again, this time restricting the calories of the low fat group while allowing the women in the low carb group to eat as much as they wanted, and then controlled for physical activity, the thermic effect of food, and their estimated resting energy expenditure. The result was the women in the low carb group still lost the most weight. Just to emphasise, they literally ate as much as they wanted, and not only lost weight, but also lost more weight than the control group who were actively cutting their calories.

This study compared a calorie restricted low-fat diet, a calorie-restricted Mediterranean diet, and a low-carb diet without caloric restriction. The people on the low-carb diet still lost the most weight despite being the only participants not to restrict calories. They also had the most favourable changes in lipids.
“Effect of low-calorie versus low-carbohydrate ketogenic diet in type 2 diabetes”
https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/22673594/
This was a study of 300+ obese and overweight individuals, a third of whom were diabetic, comparing low-carb without caloric restriction to omnivorous with caloric restriction and it found keto without restriction of any calories improved lipids more, helped more with hba1c and diabetes, and resulted in participants losing weight than those eating a regular omnivorous diet with calorie restriction
“Beneficial effect of low carbohydrate in low calorie diets on visceral fat reduction in type 2 diabetic patients with obesity”
https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/15331203/
In this study, low carb caloric restriction still beat out high carb caloric restriction in terms of weight loss and increasing HDL
“Low-carbohydrate diet review: shifting the paradigm”
https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/21586415/
This review says ""In short-term and long-term comparison studies, ad libitum and isocaloric therapeutic diets with varying degrees of carbohydrate restriction perform as well as or better than comparable LF diets with regard to weight loss, lipid levels, glucose and insulin response, blood pressure, and other important cardiovascular risk markers in both normal subjects and those with metabolic and other health-related disorders.”
“A low-carbohydrate, ketogenic diet versus a low-fat diet to treat obesity and hyperlipidemia: a randomized, controlled trial”
https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/15148063/
Participants on a low carb keto diet without caloric restriction still lost twice as much weight as participants on a low fat diet with caloric restriction, and compliance rates were higher, and changes to their lipids were more favourable. The low fat group only had a very slight decrease in triglycerides and their HDL dropped significantly whereas those on the keto diet saw a substantial increase in their HDL, a major decrease in their triglycerides, and their LDL only increased very slightly

carnivore,"30 Days on Carnivore (Male, 38)

April 22 I decided to start following the Carnivore way.

Why?  No reason besides I wanted to drop some weight and after hearing some good things about it, I was really curious.

I figured I would try it for a few days to see how I felt and take it from there.  I didn’t expect to do it an entire month!

In exactly 30 days I lost 22 LBS.  I do go to the Gym around 3-4x a week but barely any cardio.  All weights.

Overall I feel really good! 

I didn’t follow a super strict Carnivore plan, I don’t even know if I should call it Carnivore.. is Dairy Carnivore or not? haha 
Steak, stewing beef, eggs, chicken thighs, Bacon, Hard Cheese, Pork ribs.  Snacks: Pork rinds and the cleanest Pepperoni sticks I could find.
Butter and Salt.  After 2 weeks I did add pepper and Redmond’s Seasoning salt.  I had to..

My coffee intake switched from 1 cream and 1 sugar 2x a day to black or 1 cream once a day.  This is the first time in my life that I can remember not consuming any sugar outside the very small amounts in the foods I listed.  No cake, pie, donuts, cookies, sugar in coffee, nothing….  Hard to look back and say I did that, and didn’t cave in once!

I used to drink 1-2 cans of diet coke a day.  I’ve had maybe 10 in the last 30 days.  Mentally I feel great.  The last year or so I caught myself forgetting names, songs, movies but lately I don’t have that problem anymore.  I feel mentally locked in at the gym and my energy levels have been great.  No more energy drinks, just pre-workout before the gym.

I thought it would be really hard to do and maintain with my wife and 4 year old who I cook for every day, but it wasn’t bad at all.  I just ate the meat!  The hardest part is trying to explain to people in a social setting why I am not eating any fruit or vegetables and how that can’t be good for you…….   Well, I lost 22 LBS, feel great and saved probably $20 this month on not buying toilet paper lol

Anyone on the fence about starting, just do it and see how your body reacts.  I had great results fast with no hiccups along the way.  So it was a nice smooth sailing getting into this!

Anyways, that’s my story.  Thanks for all the great content in here and see you all at the 200LB mark!

carnivore,"hi everyone, we usually don't host convos about mixed diets, things are kept focused on the carnivore diet since there aren't many places to talk about it, the real deal, zero carbs. 

there still aren't, afaik, anything with looser moderation gets taken over by the ""add fruit and honey and just eat whatev bro"" brigade. 

I took the time to answer a question about it, not about eating a mixed diet all the time, but about what happens if the person changes things up from carnivore once or twice a week. 

Unfortunately, afaict they had deleted their question by the time I hit ""submit"" on my reply lol. 

so here is the answer I gave them: 

***

depends on how you divert from the diet, what you eat when you take a break from carnivore, and depends on the state of your metabolism.

let's look at the big picture first -- I always go back to Vince Gironda, because he is someone that used different diets for different goals (https://barbend.com/vince-gironda-history/)

and people know of him from his ""steak and eggs"" diet phase (""Vince’s maximum definition diet was meat and eggs for breakfast, lunch, and dinner, and on the third to fifth day of this regimen, one small carbohydrate meal was allowed to restore muscle glycogen."")

It was before the age of UPF, and he wasn't eating sugar or seed oils.

Carbohydrates were added for weight gain, incl a bit fruit but it was not a big component ...

""Whilst carbohydrates are restricted on all of Vince’s fat loss and shaping diets, they play an important role in the Weight Gaining Diet."" https://nspnutrition.com/blogs/vince-gironda/weight-gaining-diet

***

So that's the picture from someone with a healthy metabolism, eating a range of diets, including mostly carnivore steak and egg phases.

Switching things around within a real foods context is nbd for that cohort.

Sounds like where you are at?

Just avoid the junk (unless you dgaf, I mean some people smoke right? your body your choice, but no one's pretending it's good for your body)

& Keep in mind that over-feeding on starchy , sugary carbohydrate will start to increase your baseline insulin level right away. Just a week of that leads to a significant increase in insulin, even though it does not show up as dysregulated blood glucose in that short time.

Insulin problems, ""hyperinsulinemia"", start about 10 -15 years before blood sugar dysregulation shows up. (ie prediabetes, T2D).

Great intro by Dr. Ben Bikman, about the effects of different types of food on hormones (insulin, glucagon), not just on blood glucose, and why that matters -- https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z3fO5aTD6JU

And this goes deeper into it, includes some of his more recent research, about how the types of food, substrate, afffect mitochondrial biology and how that plays out at the level of the whole body, https://vimeo.com/896716488



***

Next, let's look at why people do this diet.

It used to be people only discovered this way of eating after having exhausted all the other options, including very low carb.

The condemnation of red meat and animal fat -- let alone a diet consisting of only those two things??? It was beyond the pale. Who on earth would do this first, lol. People had done versions of low fat, all sorts of diet names and fads, and the ones doing it for health reasons, similarly had gone through a range, SCD, AIP, Whole 30, Paleo, Primal, vegan, vegetarian, whole foods clean eating, ketogenic, etc etc, etc.

Back in the day, people found the longest running forum or the previous subreddit (back then people found it from ""zerocarb"", not ""carnivore"" by wondering if they could take their carbs down to zero).

The forums were basically about how to do the diet and letting people know that, no, they were not going to die from eating fatty meat, relaying the experience from clinicians who had used low carb, and seminal writing like Gary Taubes' and the medical anthropology.

There was little, essentially no research on ketogenic diets when Owsley Stanley was doing it in the 60s,70s; and still barely any when Charlene and Joe Anderson started it about 25 years ago.

The reason was that it was considered too dangerous to study, it wouldn't be ethical for people to be assigned diets high in animal fat.

Pretty wild.

That background has changed -- there is so much more research about ketogenic and lately there is also so much more awareness of carnivore diets, which is good and bad.

Good that people are learning that fatty red meat is a fabulous food.

But bad in that people who would be perfectly healthy just cutting out the sugar, grains and UPF foods (incl keto junk food), but still eating delicious omnivorous diets, are coming to the carnivore diet first and flipped out about carbs.

This is a perfectly fine diet, an evolutionarily conserved possibility open to anyone but, shrug emoji, the proportion who actually need it, as opposed to an old school low carb? I think that's pretty low.

People really need to get a grip tbh.

***

bottom line: this isn't like a vegan diet, where we're looking for converts.

Depending on the person's health and metabolism, there's a range of possible diets that would be healthy for them, including this one.

We're just here to help people learn how to do the diet, whether it's for

- a few month elimination phase, or

- bc their health condition only stays in remission when they are on the diet, or

- bc they have lost tolerance for carbohydrate and will not lose or even gain, with small amounts of carbohydrate, due to some combined inflammatory plus insulin response to the carbs.

I’ll offer some background, I’m mid 40’s, 170lbs (beginning weight) mother of 2 children, and have slinked with my weight for years…. Struggling with gluten and lactose intolerance for going on 10 to 12 years.  Over the past 3 years prior to starting carnivore, I had gained 30lbs (I was told by drs because of my age) I really struggled to lose the weight,  I felt desperate so I talked to my Dr about trying semiglutide thinking it would give me the kickstart I was desperately looking for, it was horrendous on my stomach, bloating, gas, water retention, headaches, and incredibly uncomfortable constipation, after talking to my Dr we decided it wasn’t for me, I was  semiglutide for about 5week, I quit taking it, thinking my body would stop hurting, and start healing itself and I’d at least be able to go to the bathroom regularly.  It didn’t.  After 10 months of being off of semiglutide, it just kept getting worst. I was so uncomfortable and constantly in a fighting with my body, the headaches wouldn’t let up, I was gaining more weight (not eating more at all), my hair was thinning, cramps worsting, no sex drive at all, and then backaches and insomnia decided to join in the chaos.  I went to a gastroenterologist and had a ultrasound, blood work, colonoscopy and endoscopy, he said I had a small kink in my colon (which he fix surgically) but otherwise I was normal, no gallbladder issues, not pancreatic problems, and prescribed me (3 medications) to take daily so I could just go to the bathroom, he also sent me to a physical therapist to learn some exercises to hopefully stop my bowel for kinking again.  It’s been HELL.  I needed relief, I needed to stop the pain, I was just miserable and everything I ate aggravated my stomach and my bowels.  
Here’s where my life has changed….. in just 3 1/2WEEKS of being on carnivore, I don’t have cramps after I eat,  zero bloating, I’ve lost appt 10lbs, I’m sleeping through the night and I wake up early everyday, I barely need a alarm at all.

We need to stop all these posts. Carnivore is eating meat and animal products. If you want to eat plants of any kind, fine. You’re a grown up, do what you want, but you’re not doing carnivore. This is an example of a meat based diet. 

There’s nobody in vegan subs asking other vegans permission to eat ribeyes, eggs, and ground beef. They just eat plants and processed garbage.

carnivore,"You'd like to give this diet a try... a  couple things  to know first off 

- (1) the first goal is not losing weight it is getting healthier by gaining muscle and bone density by eating lots of fatty meat every day 

- (2) transition into this can be hard, mostly because no one can tell you ahead of time which meats will be your favourites. but we have some suggestions for how to start  


***

It's really  important to eat well because you want  to turn around your body composition.

Other diets start in by restricting quantity and that leads to muscle loss. 

Here, you start in by eating to appetite whenever hungry and that increases your muscle and your BMR. 

This is called ""recomping at the same weight"" -- and this is what that looks like: 
Bret Contreras on Recomping 
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MpkwtHqtHWU

You're probably starting in with more of a fat layer, but the principle is the same. 

Switching to this way of eating will immediately lead to 

- better blood glucose, 
- better insulin levels,

And with the higher BMR from avoiding undereating and increasing muscle from proper nourishment, you will feel better. 

The phases of losing fat will follow.

The longest running carnivore forum, Zeroing In On Health, has  always recommended an initial phase of eating very heartily, ""until thanksgiving full"", when starting. 

The carnivore YT influencers, like Bella the Steak and Butter gal, and Dr Anthony Chaffee, call that ""priming"" 

Basically, it is a stage of recovering from your prior restriction on other diets, here is a podcast about it, 

https://youtu.be/qACqSF2hGBA

This is all sooooo different than other approaches to getting healthy that it is hard to get your mind  around it!

Everyone else says to semi-starve yourself  (cutting calories, extended or frequent fasting, over-exercising) and then at some mythical day in the future, you'll be able to eat normal quantities again. But that day never arrives! People  get stuck in permanent undereating to avoid gaining. 

***

Here's the tricky part, eating heartily is the goal but your appetite will be low the first 1 - 3 weeks. 

Try to eat anyways, aim for a minimum of 2lbs of fatty meat a day. 

Start in with the fattiness of  plain quarter pounder patties (not dry ones, but  nice juicy ones about the fattiness from burger restaurants) and adjust your fat from there. 

Digestion too slow? eat fattier. 

Digestion too fast? eat leaner. But tbh, that's rare when starting in with burger patties. Usually too fast digestion happens from people who hear you need to eat a lot of fat  on this diet  and start in at the high end of the fat level  and that quantity of fat overloads what their bile production can match.

Some people eat almost only steaks, but most eat burgers, sausages without fillers, bacon, eggs, some fish and seafood every so often, roasts, ground and cuts of lamb, and ground pork, too. 

Your beef doesn't have to be grass-finished, most eat and prefer grain-finished.

For supplemental fat, you'll find you have very specific preferences. Butter is a good one. Saving the bacon dripping is another. Saving the tallow from cooking ground beef or burgers is another. You can also buy tallow. 

Avoid liquid fat, the kind that renders out when cooking until you get  a sense of your tolerance. Liquid fat upsets the digestion more  easily than when the fat has solidified later. 

Some carnivores will frost their burgers with bacon dripping or tallow to increase the fat content.

I’ve been on it for 10+ years, sometimes twice a day. It’s gotten so bad in the past year and a half that I had to sleep sitting up sometimes because otherwise I had a feeling of something stuck in my throat all night. 

Had an upper endoscopy recently and they confirmed that it was acid reflux but they couldn’t really do anything about it. Just told me to finish eating earlier in the day..

Less than a month on carnivore and my acid reflux is gone. No more feeling of food stuck in my throat and 2 days ago I stopped taking Pantoprazole altogether.

I had a bit of depressing news last night and kind of went ""eff it"" and had some tortilla chips and a few cookies. They were tasty but not worth it but I was sad and upset and let my old habits of ""comfort with junk food"" kick in. This morning I was in the same mood, everything was aggravating me and I was just feeling down. I went to the fridge and pulled out the bowl of pasta salad that I had made for the other occupant of this house and was literally big spoon in bowl and ready to spoon a heaping helping into a bowl. I stopped myself. I actually told myself that this wouldn't help me feel better. It might taste good for a bit but it will set me back even further (especially after last night) and I put it back. I went back into the fridge and grabbed some bacon and a few eggs and made those instead! 

I know it's not much of a victory because of last night's slip up, but I'm legit proud of myself! I ate my breakfast and planned out the rest of my meals for the day. This is huge for me!

carnivore,"Been on carnivore for a month, the difference is night and day.

I used to suffer from anxiety from 13 to 24, anxiety is non existent after a month on carnivore. To say that my mood and mental health have improved is an understatement. It's the best I've been in my whole life. Mental clarity is off the charts. Life is good. 

Feeling great, got a lot stronger in the gym. Before carnivore I could barely lift the same weights as my sparings, now I'm lifting a little heavier weights then them and they can't keep up with me only after a month. Coordination has improved ridiculosly, it's very noticeable when playing tennis. Also I'm ridiculously fast when sprinting. The other day I did outrun friend of mine who's 60lbs lighter then me and plays football. And I've lost 15lbs of fat.

Also my libido for the whole day after eating the beef is crazy high. I've never felt anything like it before, it's madness.

One thing I've noticed is that I literally can feel better in 10 minutes after eating beef. Can anyone relate? Not sure how it's possible to feel the difference so quickly as the digestion definitely takes a lot longer then 10 minutes.

carnivore,"Good day,

First and foremost I hope this thread reaches everybody reading it in good health since that is the primary reason for this way of eating, or rather, this way of not eating most foods.

I've been on carnivore on and off, including dairy, with and without pork for a few months now and can say that I never felt better. The best I felt was when I cut out cheese and milk but still kept butter and ghee for frying, pork, eggs and beef, although I suspect I would've felt even better if I had cut out pork. Regardless, with those 5 foods, I thrive. I have, compared to carb eating, zero appetite, don't think about food nearly as often, have a clean pantry, good exercise performance, no, really, no pain in my joints or muscles, even after intense workouts, reduced skin issues which slowly improved every day doing this diet, and above all, a mind as sharp as a sword and as calm as a rock. Seriously, this is, in my opinion the greatest thing about this diet. I had no anxiety, none, although I had constant obstacles I always got them done, got a new job while studying, and am still able to concentrate on reading even after a long day of work and studying in university. I woke up every morning automatically at 7:30 am, refreshed, practically jumping out of bed, which is crazy to me, after naturally waking up about 10 am for years, or as long as I can remember. My dandruff significantly improved, which was the reason I jumped into this diet in the first place. All those benefits, and I still decided to give carbohydrates and plants another shot. 

  
The last week I started incorporating sweets, primarily chocolate and coffee. First coffee, which instantly after drinking a nice hot cup of coffee in the morning, like I used to do, gave me muscle aches, cramps and horrific pain in my joints. The same with chocolate. On top of that, and leaving the rapid weight gain aside, with sweets, I rediscovered how it felt running on carbs. And let me tell you, It's a pain in the bum, knowing how your mind felt just moments before you ate that sweet, sweet chocolate and now you can't even do tasks which before were like child's play. For example, a couple of days ago I went out with a coworker to the supermarket and I bought a bar of chocolate. It felt like the most delicious thing I ever tasted. After eating that, I couldn't even manage to properly fold a cardboard box to put a notebook in (I work in IT Administration). I must've looked so infantile. I still feel embarrassed about it. That experience took me back to so many times I've felt this way and I realized how often in life I could've avoided this simply by not eating carbohydrates and eating meat. I know, this must read like an advertisement for meat. Well it kind of is, but I'm not selling anything but good advice in return for somebody listening to my experience. 

Another point I want to make is the disconnect you feel with people around you who are running on carbs. It's like a night and day difference of mind. You know exactly how they feel because that's how you've felt all your life and you just want to tell them to stop eating all this sugar which has been normalized for the past century, but when you do they just look at you strange and think, ""A little bit of everything is good"", or, ""Meat causes cancer and too much cholesterol will clog your arteries"". It's futile, simply because sugar is a drug and everybody is hooked on it. That might be part of the reason why modern, and especially western societies aren't doing so well. Massively increased healthcare costs, sluggish and sedentary people, devoid of energy, and the minds that are attached to those unhealthy bodies. A world of zombies, essentially. Just look around! You walk through the streets and almost everybody looks unhealthy, even young people. It takes about 10 different people walking by until you find somebody who doesn't have a belly, and has youthful, fresh looking skin and broad shoulders. 

I'm writing this because I kind of feel bad for myself after buying a lot of groceries today, mostly still meat, but also grains, legumes and vegetables. After I ate wheat bread I immediately felt anxious, so I've decided to give it all away to charity and start over again tomorrow on carnivore.

What I haven't loved is trying to figure out how to get a good price for burger meat and carnivore orders ""on the go"".  I end up just paying the price of a regular order, ""minus the bun"".  But every so often I get a helpful person who knows the semantics and what you're supposed to order.

For example, I went to Chipotle once to get some steak & chicken, and the lady behind the counter says ""oh you want the three pointer?""  What's a 3-pointer?  Apparently it's 3 sides of meat for a cheaper price.  Then I went back another time and asked for it, they looked at me as confused as I looked when I first heard it, ha!

There's got to be a resource for this, right?  There's got to be an app or website that shows you what to order - meaning the correct semantics and words to use at the counter or drive thru - to get the best price on a carnivore order?

If there isn't, then by God I'll just make one.  But thought I'd ask first, to see if there's anything as a resource for this besides Googling every chain separately, or combing reddit threads.

Six months ago my YouTube feed shot up ""Plants are Trying to Kill You"" by Dr Anthony Chaffee because I am subscribed to ""Low Carb Downunder"".  I had never heard of simply eating meat alone, I would have loved this as a kid, my mother said vegetables were good for you. The only good thing I found with vegetables was they were a good butter carrier, other than that, yucko! However because I had been indoctrinated into eating vegetables because they were ""healthy"" foods, I continued to consume them, with heaps of butter in order to get them down.

The initial relief I felt once I realized there was no need to eat vegetables at all was profound!

When I adopted the carnivore diet I decided I would have to stop drinking (tried to stop many times but the need was too great). Since being on carnivore I have absolutely no desire or feel the need to drink. For me this is amazing and feel quite confident I will never have the desire to go back. (hope I am not breaking the sub's rule two here)

I had very, very high blood pressure and was being treated for it with medication. I had to stop the meds recently as my blood pressure became normal. 

All my adult life, up until I started eating carnivore, I couldn't walk barefooted on any hard surface it was extremely painful. All my slippers and walking shoes had to have very well padded soles. Now I have no pain walking on hard surfaces.

Without any effort I have lost 10kg down from 80kg and it is so much more comfortable. I imagine I will eventually drop another few kilos as my normal younger weight used to be around 57kg. 

My IBS and mild incontinence has gone, thank heavens. Pooping only every other day is brilliant. Found out I can't eat cheese or yoghurt, back will come the problem. However I feel no loss. I can still eat plenty of cream and butter.

My energy and endurance levels have increased profoundly. 

In the last few years I could detect a kind of ""old lady"" smell on my dirty laundry, since carnivore, that has gone away, replaced by a more normal ""person"" smell. Is this telling me some unknown health issues are resolving? No idea, for me it's just an interesting observation.

There is one small downside for me, every two or three weeks for a few days, I can feel some very strong pain in my neck and feet which is quite unpleasant and tiring. After having looked into this whole plant poison thing I believe I am going through some Oxalate being expelled out of my body a bit faster or in greater volume than is normal or comfortable.

carnivore,"Hey there,

40 y old guy here. Used to be a gym rat in college, basically was eating paleo without really knowing it. For the last few years to a decade I felt sick/drowsy everyday, no energy, always hungry and could not go more than 3-4 hours before having to wat or having hunger pain.

I just tried carnivore for the past 2 months because to me it was close to what I used to do in the past and I figured I had nothing to lose. Well I did lose something: excess weight. At this rate I'll be back to my college weight or better within 2-3 months.

My depression I carried for most of my life is gone.

I don't fall asleep all the time anymore.

I don't feel hungry all the time anymore. I eat once a day.

I basically eat what I always loved (meat).

Now I feel like I can lift a mountain and I'm getting my gym gear and equipment from my storage to start weight lifting and maybe even amateur bodybuilding as I did almost 20 years ago. I'd say my only issue atm are coworkers who tell me I'm going to kill myself following this diet (I don't call it a diet, I see it as a nutrition style), but the one thing they all have in common is they are severely overweight and many of them have diabetes. I don't want to point the obvious, but I figured in a few months to a year my apearence will speak louder than words.

carnivore,"Sometime during this last summer, I passed my 10 year mark of successfully completing my first month of eating this way. Back then, that mattered because we didn't count from our first attempt at eating this way. If we could, I would be able to date my tenure several months earlier. It was a different world back then. This way of eating was virtually unknown. The downside was that you really were going off into the wilderness almost on your own. The upside was that the information was limited to what was known to work. These days, everyone is talking about ""carnivore,"" even though it seems like the majority aren't doing it and don't understand it.  In this post, I am going to take you back. I am going to take you back to the basics. This will tell you what carnivore is and how it is supposed to be done. I'm going to use the words of ""The Bear"" for structure, because he was a modern contemporary example of actually doing it.

Who is the Bear? That's an interesting question. He's not a one-dimensional figure. For our purposes, I will allow him to introduce himself as he did:

>I have been eating the natural human dietary regime for over 47 years now. I do not eat anything whatsoever from vegetable sources. The only things veggie I use are spices. My diet is usually 60% fat and 40% protein by calories. I used to eat 80/20 when younger and about twice as much quantity of meat also, but that seems too much energy at my age, which is 71- even though I am very active.

The Bear found ""The Fat of the Land"" in his early days and started to eat that way. He ate this way until he died in a car accident. While he was still around, he shared his experience and his rules. He had what is normally summed up as 7 rules. At different times, he shared different rules. But, they usually included the same ideas.

From his original thread:

>Eat only from the animal kingdom. Avoid eating carby animal food, like lactose (dairy) and more than a very small, occasional, few ounces of liver.

>Do not measure what you eat and do not worry about variety.

>Do as little cooking of your food as you can tolerate.

>Eat the fatty part preferentially in each meal first, then finish as much of the lean as you want. Leftovers will keep.

>You do not need 'recipes' or 'sample meals' to follow.

>When away from home, no matter if it is a restaurant, family or friends, or business meal, eat only from the animal kingdom, avoid the rest, practice doing this unassumingly and make pleasant, distracting comments if bailed up on it. Learn to politely refuse alcohol.

From ZIOH:

>1- Eat only from the animal world (eggs, fish, red meat and fowl and some dairy are all animal-sourced foods, i.e.: meat).

>2- Eat nothing from the vegetable world whatsoever. (Very small amounts of flavourings such as garlic/chillies/spices/herbs which may be added, are not ‘food’).

>3- On diary: avoid milk and yoghurt (heavy carbs- lactose), use only pure (not ‘thickened’- heavy) cream (read the label), cheese and unsalted butter.

>4- Don’t cook your meat very much- just a little bit on the outside- for flavour- blood-rare or bleu. For this reason I advise against eating pork.

>5- Eat liver and brains only very infrequently- they are full of carbs.

>6- Be sure to have plenty of fat of animal origin at each meal and eat mostly of the fat until you feel you have had enough- you can eat more lean at this point if you like- calories are not important, nor is the number of meals/day. Vegetable oils are not good food.

>7- You do not need any supplements of any kind. Drink a lot of water and do not add salt to anything.

From ""Bear's Words of Wisdom""

>• Eat only food from animals  
• No vegetables  
• Limit liver intake  
• Avoid liquid milk (except for butter and cheese)  
• Eat as much fat as you like  
• Don’t cook your food much  
• Avoid salt  
And the most important one: Eat your meals as a matter of course, don’t waste any time thinking about food–it is merely a way to stay alive, and must not rule your life.  
By the way, for many obese people low carb does not work–only zero carb does (defined as less than 5 g/day).

So, there it is.  If it's not in the above rules, it isn't carnivore or it doesn't matter. Now look carefully, do you see how these rules differ from a lot of the ""carnivore"" plans that people are promoting? Do you see a difference in attitude and approach?

First, ""don't waste time thinking about food."" No recipes or sample meals or daily food guides. Don't measure shit, don't track stuff, don't obsess about purity and details. If you're out to eat, do your best to stick to pure meat, but don't obsess about trace amounts of impurities. That's the path to an eating disorder. Eat like an animal, you are one.  If you happen to end up consuming a trace amount of sugar or flour, while eating out, it's not a huge deal for most people. You move on and your body will be fine.

Second, limit liver and salt consumption. The modern ""gurus"" almost universally try and push over-consumption of both of these up to and way past the point of causing illness. You don't need either, ever. The people pushing these items are making their inexperience and ignorance obvious by putting it on display.

Third, dairy isn't a free food that you can just consume tons of. No milk. Creams and cheeses are more like seasonings than full foods. And butter is fine, but it's not something to cram down your gullet or hide in your coffee to consume extra.

Fourth, seasonings are fine. At least in the trivial amounts you should be using them. It doesn't take a lot to add flavor to meat. So often, I see people freaking out about how they are bored and can't eat. Then I also find out they are doing some super-weird and super-restrictive diet like only beef without any seasonings. That's silly. That's not required. There's no award for dumbest way to be carnivore or hardest time adapting. Actually, the award for hardest time adapting seems to be complete failure to adapt.

That's it folks. It really is. Eat fatty animal meat. Eat often and as much as you want. Stop thinking too much about it. Don't freak out about a little seasoning. Avoid vegetable oils and salt, but you also don't need to freak out and obsess about perfectly avoiding them. If you're thinking about this, you're making it harder than it is. And, yeah, carbs do still count. That's especially true for obese people. And, that means 0-5 g/day or you're going to have a bad time.",Back to the Basics with Bear,t2_9jt9p,0.93,69,1729107677.0,1729107677.0,66,partlyPaleo,1g583we
carnivore,"
I’ve (26F) lost 40lbs in the past 9 months (SW 236.4, CW 196.4). 

It’s been a long journey but I’m grateful for the slow and steady weight loss I have experienced.

I first lost 15lbs on an AB diet. I used AB to transition to a carnivore lifestyle. Instead of going straight from SAD to carnivore.

After a several months of AB I began carnivore.

It took a couple attempts of strict carnivore to fully commit. I really struggled with the diet in social settings. But now I’m happy to say I have been carnivore (dairy and coffee friendly) for 2 months. In total I have lost 25lbs on carnivore.

Some of the benefits:
- weight loss 
- mental clarity and productivity
- am not constantly thinking of or needing food. Lately my fasting window has unintentionally been anywhere from 12-20 hours
- extreme confidence, I think this comes from having such healthy control of my body
- ambition and goal setting/achievement 
- mental peace and calmness 
- menstrual cycle irregularities have become more consistent

Cons:
- social settings are tricky. They take some forethought so you’re not stuck in a situation where you’re hungry without carnivore options

In this time I have also stopped drinking and started exercising. I walk around 7500 steps everyday and do strength training a few times a week. I strongly believe that these two changes have also been substantial to my journey.

Thanks to everyone in this subreddit for sharing your stories and tips! You’ve helped me find my way 😁

First time poster. So I've been on carnivore for a bit over a week (POTS. Chronic Fatigue. Hashimotos. Low Iron. Congestion. Muscle weakness. Brain fog. Bloat. Low blood pressure And more). Post partum really hit me with a whole lot of extra.

And I don't want to get too excited but my symptoms had reduced dramatically.

My HR went from 120-130s standing and 90-120s sitting to (on carnivore) 70-90s standing and 50-60s sitting. It's been a crazy change in such a short amount of time. My bloating (which I didn't know I had) reduced. My exhaustion was much less. Less muscle weakness and fatigue. 

Cue Christmas morning and I didn't want to be a burden so I thought, alright I'll have a small meal and some snacks. Gluten free, dairy free etc. wasn't like I was eating cheetos. 
BUT my HR jumped right up to 120 Sitting. Felt like I was going to faint. Congestion. My hands broke out in pins and needles and a red burning splotchy pattern. They're still burning 10 hours later. Immediately fatigued and weak. 

It's absolutely insane how quickly that happened and now I wonder how much inflammation has been under the surface this whole time.

I'm near retirement age.  

A few years ago, I switched to ""Healthy Keto"" but am now ""Mostly Carnivore"".  Done with alcohol, although I was never much of a drinker.  Lost 70 pounds.  Normal everything now.  Trim.  For the first time in my life, I can do chin-ups in the gym, which is about the only thing I do besides walking.  No meds.

Before I switched, I had skin tags, floaters, got up to pee about 5 times a night, tired after lunch, skin problems, inflammation.

And so many tooth cavities.  Not a single cavity since I switched!

carnivore,"I discovered pemmican a few years ago and finally jumped into the making of pemmican at home. I've mainly just made small batches and then kept it in 200g packages in the freezer, mainly for convenience sake of getting it rock hard. I've typically just pulled a package out occasionally and chomp on it as a snack if we have a movie night or some other evening when we get the urge for snacking.

I've recently planned and packaged up several packages for our euro vacation as a flight meal... Obviously nothing served on the flight remotely resembles sustenance and 'food' so we quietly unwrapped and ate our pemmican bars while the smells of the airline 'food' filled the cabin during the near 9 hour flight. Following the flight and the couple hour drive to destination Italian coastal town, we felt delightful... No fatigue, no belly bloat and just felt wonderful despite not really sleeping much on the overnight flight.

We later planned and ventured to the northern region by car, 7 hour drive and we decided to bring our packets of pemmican for the journey instead of splitting up the day with a restaurant stop not to mention locating a viable meat meal and trying to work out timing and risking a sleepover interrupting our journey. Once again, pemmican was an absolute savior for our unorthodox day of traveling. We mearly split the drive with two snack stops where we stopped at the rest stops and enjoyed our pemmican bars which countered the hunger and just reenergized our body, mind and even our conversations for the trip. Again we arrived feeling just wonderful and not really too tired from sitting and driving the whole day's journey.

Having had such a great experience with using pemmican as emergency sustenance for travels and convenient refuelling, I'm really going to miss it on our travels home in a few weeks...

The above got me wondering if anyone has every done an exclusive pemmican diet for several days or even weeks and had any insights to offer for the carnivore community.

Excuse the long post, I'm just so excited to go make pemmican and perhaps do an extended self trial on living on just pemmican for a week.

Edit: Recipe was easy, completely dehydrated beef to a crisp, blended into near powder, made tallow from suit (cut into small pieces and simmered for an hour or so at medium meat), added equal weight of pulverized meat with warm tallow into a Pyrex lasagna pan... Stirred it slowly but thoroughly to ensure no dry powder is visible. Once it was nice and formed, I pressed into the surface some baked strips of bacon evenly and then sprinkled coarse Himalayan salt evenly for an added flavor zip. Put the dish into the fridge overnight and then cut into bacon sized bars around 80-100g each, wrapped individually with paper and foil into tight bars.

We put all the bars into a small soft sided picnic cooler and carried onto flight prepared to say they were our meal for flight as we have food allergies.

I thank all of you for providing your personal  anecdotal and researched evidence to support the carnivore lifestyle. Like many of you said, we took it 30 days at a time.

And whilst we are only 30 days in, we are most certainly going to go for another 30 and another 30…

I want to write this post so that others similar to me, whether they’re dealing with PCOS or something else, can have a personalised account of the benefits.

In 30 days we have achieved the following:
- I am down 9.3kg/20.5lbs
- my husband is down about 9.5kg
- better sleep. It feels like it’s deeper and fuller. No grogginess upon waking.
- after we got through the sugar detox, we have both been regular with the toilet. 
- no gas! Smaller poos!
- more energy.
- my husband has severe adhd and he has been able to start tapering down a little bit. He still takes his meds but he doesn’t often need to take the dex after the vyvanse. He can now just take the vyvanse dose which is higher for the same effect. He’s getting more mileage out of his meds basically. Also, his emotional regulation is showing so much improvement. Less outbursts.
- no pain! We both had knee pain. Mine from an old oly weightlifting injury (dislocated patella) and he had a knee reco first year of CV. We have NO PAIN! No inflammation or swelling around those joints.
- PCOS and PMS symptoms: I started my period literally a day after we started carnivore. I had severe pain on that first day, curled over, sweats, nausea. I passed out in bed from pain. At the end of this 30 day carnivore period, I got my period again. I DIDN’T EVEN KNOW IT ARRIVED!!!!! No pain in my ovaries, no cramping. Slight boob tenderness and lower back sensitivity but it passed after the first half day. No heaviness in my period and it was done in 3 days. WOW!!!! I have never, in my life to date, not had a painful period. I cried.

We are converted. My husband even told our friend yesterday that he’s not the type to preach about stuff, but he feels so good on carnivore and what it’s doing for him that he can’t not share. We’re not putting limitations on our time. But we have agreed we will keep doing it 30 days at a time and no doubt at some point those stats won’t even be relevant because it’ll just be what we do.

carnivore,"Some vegan peeps were trying to post about it here

This is a response to that and to similar studies. 

First off, nutritional epidemiology is very flawed, illustrated by this classic from Five Thirty Eight: ""Consider what has been ""the underpinning of the nutrition scientific establishment for over 50 years ... ""

https://abcnews.go.com/fivethirtyeight/video/fivethirtyeight-problem-nutrition-studies-56038322 (about 3 min)

For more in depth look at the problems with nutrition science, the Swiss Re BMJ conferences, https://www.swissre.com/institute/conferences/food-for-thought-bmj-2020.html and from 2018 https://www.bmj.com/food-for-thought

from the 2023 conference, https://www.swissre.com/institute/conferences/food-for-thought-2023.html

Worth pointing out that nutritional epidemiology doesn't always find a correlation between red meat and colorectal cancer, ""Red and processed meat isn't associated with colorectal cancer in Asia, where it's a health food and food of the wealthy rather than the poor."" -- George Henderson comment on this study, https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/10408398.2018.1495615?journalCode=bfsn20

Or ""the incidence of colorectal cancer was significantly higher among vegetarians than among nonvegetarians."" https://academic.oup.com/ajcn/article/89/5/1620S/4596951?login=false

but it's so flawed that we can't take it as a form of evidence, either way.

For some of the zerocarb/carnivores, eating animal source foods exclusively is the only way of eating which has brought them full health. They look and feel healthier and their health markers improve and their chronic health conditions go into remission as long as they eat this way. eg consider Terri's experience -- https://www.dietdoctor.com/how-terri-lost-200-pounds-and-reversed-her-type-2-diabetes

Their health improves on eating only animal source foods -- but based on poor quality (really bad!!) nutritional epidemiology they should switch to a way of eating which immediately brings about poorer health for them? That doesn't make sense. Specifically for GI health -- which seems a better choice, diets where they are living with active, chronic cases of their condition or a way of eating which puts their GI condition into remission?

There are a cluster of diseases which appeared in populations when the storage foods were introduced, chronic diseases we tend to think are a normal part of living and aging. Whether the populations were eating omnivorous diets or diets wholly of animal source foods, they did not have these chronic ""western diseases"" until the storage foods came along.

Go through the medical anthropology, start with the references in Gary Taubes' Good Calories Bad Calories, pp 89 - 99, the Diseases of Civilization chapter.

Here he is talking about that research, at the 12m55s-17m30s section of Biomed Central Metabolism, Diet and Disease Conference, The Obesity-Cancer Connection Panel, : https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EffpuKqWWF8 (the section starts a minute and a half earlier, at the 11m30s mark, talking about insulin sensitizing)

Burkitt & Trowell's work -- ""Diseases of Westernization"" includes some of the observations about the variation in the presence of chronic diseases between different populations. Burkitt mistakenly thought it was the fiber that made the difference, even though he knew about Inuit experience and that it was similar to the other H-G groups: that the chronic western diseases (incl cancer) were rare to non-existent on their traditional diets before the introduction of the storage foods. He omitted the Inuit experience when forming his hypothesis because he had a preference for the fiber hypothesis. But despite a diet of little to no fiber, Inuit also did not have the chronic Western diseases until the introduction of storage foods.

A more coherent hypothesis would have been that the addition of the storage foods was the problem and the fiber, if it did anything, was an improvement only because it displaced the storage foods. (that hypothesis is more coherent, but also not a great hypothesis, because fiber can make things worse, see: https://www.reddit.com/r/ketoscience/wiki/fiber. If you go through Burkitt's lifetime of research, it wasn't convincing for the fiber hypothesis, the idea was compelling, but the outcomes were not.

carnivore,"Someone was asking in modmail about the reasons for the subreddit rule,

""This subreddit is for adults

""This subreddit makes the assumption that you are an intelligent adult  and capable of making your own health choices. We are wary of making  recommendations towards children and teens. If you are interested in an  all-meat diet for your child or you are a teen who is interested, we  encourage you to work directly with a medical professional. ""

\*\*\*

The reason is that while we have some cultural knowledge about carnivore for adults, we are missing knowledge about the way the diet was practiced for children in cultures which lived on carnivore most of the year.

What we do know is there was a wide range of practices in the far north, many variations with a base of the fatty meat and fish, which ofc is mostly what is available.

Even an area the size of St Lawrence Island in Alaska would have at least a few different foodways, none of them exclusively carnivore. But all low carb, low glycemic carb, about 10 - 30% of the diet, and carbs were mostly seasonal.

The Canadian far north in the deep of winter would have been -40C, -50C for stretches, -20C would have been warmer days where it was easy to move around outdoors. There were only a few months above freezing in the summer.  They didn't faff around with berries in the winter, but preserved fat, fish and animal harvests for their food for the weeks when it was too cold to hunt. For one group, in the deepest part of winter, those extremely cold stretches, they would mostly stay indoors, and a couple people would go out in the morning to gather the day's fish which they had stocked outdoors on a platform. It was so cold, they had to handle it gingerly or it would shatter.

There was one group Stefansson encountered which was exclusively carnivore, but they were in transition, adopting some of the cultural practices of other northern groups they were meeting. The other groups would have had berries in season and some other seasonal low glycemic carbs. The way he described it, the kids were interested in them, the adults kept to their usual. (Much like how us supermarket culture carnivores will lose interest in other foods once adapted).

Because of that transition, that fully carnivorous culture would have only lasted for that older generation, the up and coming generations would have kept having berries in season. And then, not too long later, some decades, the storage foods would have arrived.

One thing that is known -- for all of those cultures, kids would have been nursed  (breastfed) until they were 4-5 years old. It would be excusively for the first 6 months - 1 year, then  solid food would have been introduced and gradually increased over the  next almost four years before they self-weaned.

That nursing would have provided important insulin & growth stimulus, alongside the fatty meat and fish.

Our culture mimics that either with nursing and/or with formula with some sugars for the first year, and then onto dairy.

Once weaned,  which in our culture is when the toddler gives up the bottle, if kids aren't eating the high sugar, seed oil standard diet (😬), the insulin stimulus from extended nursing could be mimicked by meat and dairy plus non-grain starches and fruits.

That's what people who follow low carb ways of eating tend to do for their kids, avoid sugar and grains, but a more paleo/primal way of eating, with meats and dairy, potatoes, sweet potatoes, fruits (not just berries), and nuts.

For teens, for cultures who lived traditionally on only fatty meat and fish for most of the year, what we do know is that, they ate 5 - 10 lbs of fatty meat a day. That large quantity would also provide more insulin stimulus, alongside their shift in hormones to become insulin resistant,  priming them for growth.

That's darned expensive getting that from the store 😮

For the teen we know of with Crohn's who did this diet about 10 years ago, he sucessfully put his condition into remission, and returned to a normal healthy weight & height, from being severely underweight. He did it under  medical supervision, and  included honey, which would have provided  the insulin stimulus and did not need to eat the stunning quantities which teens ate in the far north -- because of the insuinogenic effects of the honey? We don't really have enough info, but that's a good hypothesis. He still eats a carnivore diet, I think he's studying medicine now. Does anyone have an update?

\*\*\*

Last, but not least, there is the social component. that's hugely important and a flexible approach is the way to go.

Kelly Williams-hogan has talked about how she handles birthday parties for her kids. They like fruit, so she takes fruit instead of cake.

for Ken & Neisha's Berry's kids, she's still nursing the smallest  and for the older, who's 3,  the base is meat, eggs, and he likes a lot of whole milk dairy (goat milk), nuts, and they're also fine with his having grapes, apples, bananas, as well as berries. The whole  dairy and fruits are providing the insulin stimulus.

For social occasion, since their son is metabolically flexible, Dr Berry said that the kids will have donuts and cake at parties.

Once failed because I couldnt leave the sugar behind, and once because I kept gaining weight. Now I have found out that that was because of the lack of fat.
About 5 days ago I started again and so far it's going great! I physically feel so much better and I have lost around 3,5kg/8 pounds so far.
At my heaviest I was around 155-160kgs/341-352 pounds. So very heavy. I had no control over my eating habits, binges, and have been going through a lot of mental problems which caused me to not go to school and lay in bed all day and eat.
With other diets I had already lost around 15kgs/33 pounds. But it were either crash diets or things that I couldnt do for a longer period of time.
I have also done keto for a long time, but in the end it wasn't working for me. After doing keto, no sugar, vegan shake diet, calorie defecit, smoothie diet... you name it.. luckily the carnivore diet is working for me this time and I couldn't be more happier.

Have you seen the [Carnivore Diet article on Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carnivore_diet) recently at all?

I think perhaps the most interesting part of the wiki article, is if you look at the [talk section.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talk:Carnivore_diet) Quite recently, It's had what I think is fair pushback on the content and way the article is written, as well as the fact [the maintainer's very first line of their profile implies they are a vegetarian](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User:Psychologist_Guy).

It’s normally made out of high quality pork fat, the one I get uses Iberico pork. 

I keep it in the freezer, slice it up and eat with slices of cheese.

carnivore,"# What Should I Read First?

Obviously, this FAQ is a good start.  Other recommended reading is [The Fat of the Land](http://justmeat.co/docs/the-fat-of-the-land-vilhjalmur-stefansson.pdf) (should be required reading), [Bear's Words of Wisdom](http://justmeat.co/docs/the-bear.pdf) (also pretty important), and [Strong Medicine](http://justmeat.co/docs/strong-medicine-blake-donaldson.pdf) (optional but has some good information).  All three of those are available as PDFs from those links.  They are listed in order of how beneficial they are.  I have rarely seen a question that was not addressed in The Fat of the Land.

# I'm sorry but the idea of a zerocarb diet having book requirements sounds like ultimate gatekeeping to me.

This way of eating has a history and that history defines what it is and how it is done.  When someone has questions, they are usually already answered in those sources.  I did not say that any of the books are  required.  I said one 'should' be required, another was pretty  important, and one was optional.  No one is being forced to do anything.   It helps to read the books.  But, we answer the questions of those who don't.

# How Long Should I Try?

You should commit to a full 30 days and 100 individual meals, whichever is greater.  During this time, absolutely no deviation or cheating allowed.  If you cheat, or deviate, restart both counts.

# Should I Slowly Reduce Carbs or Jump Right In?

Some of the other moderators here often will tell people to go do keto, paleo, or some other low-carb plan first.  I don't agree with them.  But, you can go try that.  Your first day of zerocarb will not start until after you completely drop everything though.  I say to just commit and get through it.  Stefansson (The Fat of the Land) says the same thing.

>Beginning the meat diet gradually, trying to make the change less  painful, would be about as considerate as chopping a dog's tail off  gradually, by inches.  \[. . .\] I have seen to it, irrespective of  this token hoarding, that the men changed abruptly from the mixed to  the straight meat diet, the saved-up delicacies being strictly saved,  never used in any tapering off process.

# What Can't I Eat?

You can't eat anything that isn't from the animal kingdom.  That means no plant foods, no artificial sweeteners (nothing sweet actually), no fiber supplements, no alcohol, and no plant oils/fats.  This includes honey.  Some people confuse themselves into thinking honey is an animal product.  It is not.  It isn't even something debatable.  Honey is not allowed in any amounts in the carnivore/zerocarb way of eating.

# OK, What Can I Eat?

You can have any kind of meat.  You do not need to stick with beef.  If you like pork, eat pork.  If you are craving some chicken, eat some chicken.  The same goes for everything else: rabbit, fish, lamb, etc.  You can eat high-fat and low-carb dairy.  That's butter, hard cheeses, and creams.  Dairy can cause issues for people, it should not be considered a main course.  It is more like a seasoning or a side.  Some cheese on a burger is fine.  An 8 ounce block of cheese by itself?  That is not fine.  Eggs are fine also.

# What About Milk?

Don't drink milk. You are a grownup.  As people age, milk become less and less appropriate for humans. Young children can drink milk.

After you had adapted, if you wish to try to include milk, you can give it a shot.  Some people have no problems and find it benefits them.  But, during the getting started phase, no milk.  And, the majority of people never go back to it.

# Do I Need to Eat My Meat Raw?

Nope.  Cook your meat however you like it.

# Do I Need to Eat Organs or Grass-Finished Meat?

Nope.  Eat the meat you enjoy and can afford.  There is no need to ever eat organs or grass-finished meat.  You really do not need to concern yourself with it when just starting.

# What About Seasonings, Salt, and Spices?

Spices are allowed (although make sure sugar is not an ingredient).  Plants are allowed as seasonings and medicines.  A light sprinkling of some spices will not be a problem for most people, although some people do have issues.  Do not get too aggressive with it, light is better.   Meat is delicious, it does not need much to enhance the flavor.  Salt is something you can consume to taste.  There are people who insist you need extra and others who insist that you need none.  Stefansson says none.  The Bear says none.  Most people feel better with salt, even extra salt, at the start.  It is not a deal breaker.

# What About Electrolytes? You don't mention them and lots of people on the sub talk about them.

It is covered under seasonings and  salt. Short answer, historical practice has considered salt to be  problematic and it was not permitted. People adapted fine and we're  successful without using any salt or electrolytes (even during the  adaptation phase).  Stefansson even refused to take it with him on the long journeys and what little they had ran out at the same time they went from a mixed diet to a zerocarb one cold-turkey.

Lots of people  mention it. Sure. Lots of people believe they need to consume a bunch  and worry about balancing electrolytes. They will insist they had  symptoms that only resolved because they increased salt or added  magnesium or whatever. Or they insist they get certain symptoms if they  cut or reduce these things. It will never cease to amaze me, the  powerful effect that beliefs can have on the body.

In the end, salt is probably not super harmful.  If it makes you feel better and sleep well at night, have some extra salt. It is not a deal breaker.

# What About Coffee or Tea?

Coffee and tea are not good for you.  But, coffee is generally well tolerated and accepted by many.  Stefansson allowed it, the Bear allowed it, and many long-term carnivores will still drink it.  It falls into the category of plants as flavoring and/or drugs.  You can keep it for the start.  If you do, it is highly recommended that you try going without it at some point in the future.  Tea tends to be harder on the kidneys and body.  A cup should be fine.  But, but not too much.

If you drink either, some cream is fine.  Real cream and not creamer.  No sweeteners of any kind.  No butter, no coconut oil or MCTs (plant oils are not allowed).  Absolutely no Bullet-Proof coffee monstrosities.

# What About Alcohol?

No.  Definitely not at the start.  And, it is not a great idea after.  If you can't stop drinking for 30+ days while you get through the 30 days / 100 meals, you have bigger problems with alcohol than you do with your food.  Fix that first.

# How Much Should I Eat / When Should I Eat?

More than you expect and more often than you think.  The absolute minimum recommended amount (from Strong Medicine) is 3 meals a day of 6 ounces of lean and 2 ounces of fat.  That is equivalent to 3x8oz of (75%/25% ground beef).   One and a half pounds over three meals is about 1,995 calories and 109 grams of protein.  This is the FIRM minimum allowed (small women might get prescribed and eat this amount).  Eating more at any of the three meals was allowed.  For larger people more was encouraged.  Eating less than this was failure to follow the protocol.

Ideally, you will attempt to follow a similar eating protocol and plan at the start.

We   strongly discourage intermittent fasting during the first days.  We know that many zerocarbers who have done this for a while will eat 1-2   meals a day, but very few of them started there.  The first purpose of   eating this way is to relearn your body's signals and needs.  You  should  eat when you are hungry and as much as you want.  For people who  have a  history of calories restriction, IF, fasting, or other stuff  like that,  you might have messed up your ability to know when you are  hungry.  Try  and eat several times during the day.  Have at least two  bites of the  food.  If you eat a couple of bites and really aren't  interested, put it  away and come back to it later.  You will often be  shocked to learn  that you were hungry.  This has other benefits.   First, it reduces  cravings for the foods you shouldn't eat.  If you are  full, you are less  likely to fall to temptation.  Second, it provides  ample nutrients for  your body to heal and get back on track.  Third,  you are sending signals  to your body that food is ample and there is no  shortage.  There's no  need to preserve excess fat, energy is available  for the taking whenever  desired.  You may not lose super quickly  eating this way, although many  people do still lose a lot, you will get  healthy and reach a healthy  weight this way.  Remember, you can starve  yourself thin; but, you will  never starve yourself healthy.

Our position on IF is perfectly summed up by The Bear.

>It   is perfectly ok to only eat one large meal/day, like a three pound   steak- but it is likewise just as ok to eat as many as six. If you are   working out and trying to gain muscle mass, eat six smaller steaks   rather than one or two big ones. I have eaten as much as four or five    pounds of steak in a day- and as little as one or two, it matters   not--but if you ingest less calories than you are burning, you will lose   muscle mass as well as bodyfat. If you ingest more than you need, the   body discards the excess--quite different than is the case with carbs.

# I Can't  Eat Enough At My OMAD!

OMAD is a totally different way of eating from carnivore. Let go of that idea and eat multiple times.

There are zerocarbers who end up  eating one huge meal a day, but it is not everyone. Lots of people end  up with two or three meals a day. Some feel best with even more. But the  number of meals does not matter. All of them eat when their body  requests food. All of them eat enough to fuel their body well.

If  you read the above, the minimum amount for starting out should be three  meals of 8 ounces or more of fatty meat. After you have a few months  under your belt and have learned to listen to your body when it asks for  more or is not asking for food, then you can try something else.

# How Will I Poop Without Fiber?

You   will poop again.  It might slow down.  It might speed up.  Do not  trust  a fart.  One frequent adaptation issue is very loose movements.   It's  not uncontrollable diarrhea, but it is very watery.  These things   normalize in time.  But, you will almost never fart.  If you think you   have to fart, try going to the bathroom.  You won't regret that   precaution.

# Do I Need to Take Supplements? What About Medications?

You do not need supplements.  You can continue to take medications prescribed to you.  Be aware that your body may become more sensitive to the medication and require less as time goes on.  Work with your doctor.

# Do I Need to Buy Anything?

You do not need anything to eat this way.  Do not go out and buy ketone strips, glucose monitors, coaching or anything else.  There is no need to pay for any books.  We have the main ones available for free.  There are no supplies you need to buy, other than the meat that you can afford and enjoy.  It is not  wrong to buy someone's book, but you are not going to be more successful because you do.

Be wary of people trying to sell you something.  There is no need to pay $120 a month for coaching.  We provide all the information you need here for free.  Actually, all the best, most experienced, and helpful zerocarbers offer their help for free and are out there.  Many of us have been helping others for years, for free.  You don't need to buy your meats from any specific supplier.  There are no supplements or vitamins that we are selling.  In fact, if anyone offers advice that also includes something you should buy, that is a pretty good sign that you shouldn't trust them.

# Who Do I Trust?

You will frequently see people with different opinions arguing on here.  People will tell you that you need to eat liver, fast, stare at the sun, rub your left foot counterclockwise under a full moon, etc.  Often this advice will be contradictory.  When in doubt, compare that advice to The Fat of the Land, The Bear's Words of Wisdom, and maybe Strong Medicine (if you haven't already got an answer by then).  If none of those address it, chances are it is not that important.  Look for people who have been doing this for a while and what they do, although be careful.  Some people lie about how long they have done it.  Use your common sense and be willing to test things yourself.  Just because we eat this way does not mean we reject all science, common sense, and logic.  Staring at the sun and arguing that the Earth is flat does not make you extra-zerocarb, it makes you extra-special (and not in a good way).

# Will I Get Scurvy?

No.  Read The Fat of the Land for more details.

# Will I Die?

Yes.  You are human, and all humans will eventually die.  But, this diet won't kill you.  This is the diet meant to keep you alive and healthy.  It will not make you immortal.  It won't make you immune from all disease or a super-hero.  It will give your body the best fighting shot at health.

# What If I Have a Special Medical Issue or Condition?

First, always work with your medical professional.  They are aware of your specific situation in a way that people on the internet are not.  For people with histamine issues and other issues with severe allergies, it may require cutting all spices out and seeking fresher meat than normal (start with spices).  People without gallbladders might need to eat more often to avoid overloading on fat.   Some people may find that they react to eggs and dairy and they need to reduce even those down to zero.  If possible, try and complete a run before tweaking, but also be aware of your specific circumstances.

carnivore,"Recently had the thought of getting a whole brisket ground, finally did it, and it was a great decision. 

I’m in dfw Texas and there is a good specialty butcher shop that sources local meat. Went in and asked if they would grind a whole brisket for me, and they were happy to do it. Didn’t even charge anything to grind it and package it the way I wanted for individual servings. Perfect for freezing! I asked them not to trim it at all, and my best estimate is that it’s about 50/50 fat ratio. I also love that it’s from a single animal and a single cut, not random leftovers and hundreds of different dna strands like would be present in the pre ground grocery store meat. Paid 7.99 a pound all in and I would recommend it to anyone. 

Having the idea to throw a pound of bacon into the mix next time. What do my fellow carnivores think?",Go get you a ground brisket,t2_4nunwnzp,0.95,53,1711341027.0,1711341027.0,52,urmomwent2university,1bn53l9
