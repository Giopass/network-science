I had low expectations but was utterly shocked at how good it was, the brisket was made from [A5 grade wagyu](https://static.wixstatic.com/media/b90b62_a42dbc0d11504e7a8664bf12b5dc35f4~mv2.jpg/v1/fill/w_480,h_360,al_c,q_80,usm_0.66_1.00_0.01,enc_auto/b90b62_a42dbc0d11504e7a8664bf12b5dc35f4~mv2.jpg) so it’s the best marbling there is in the world, and this place did better pork ribs and bbq chicken than 95% of the places I’ve been to in Texas.

What a gem my friends and I found.

**Edit:** Some people in this thread are telling me how it's not brisket, or how it's not smoked, or how it's not A5 Wagyu. Well I'm glad they documented the process on YouTube before, if you just search ""20 HOUR SMOKED A5 Japanese Wagyu BEEF BRISKET"" on YouTube (links not allowed here), you can get a video documenting the process.

That's the thing about businesses in Japan, it's all about credibility and for a long running restaurant like this false advertising on the menu would be unthinkable.

Btw A5 brisket price runs for about $15/kg here in Japan, which is about 20-30 times cheaper than when they are exported: https://www.m-mart.co.jp/rep/item/detail/maruifoods/64?type=buybuys&no=number",

I'm not sure if you're being intentionally daft or this is just your natural state of being, but your photo is not A5 brisket. Its an impossibility that it's A5. 

Please realize that there are professionals on this planet that know things to a far greater degree than you ever will as an enthusiastic anatuer who has never done a single menu cost in your life. Its silly to argue with someone that does it on a weekly basis for over a decade. 

Currently, A5 Wagyu brisket runs about $900 per brisket retail, and wholesale is going to generally run anywhere from 60-70% of that cost. You also lose 30-40% weight when smoking brisket, so the cost per weight is going to increase accordingly.

For the sauce, what I typically like is Chinese black vinegar, soy sauce, some minced garlic, roughly chopped cilantro, chili oil (or chili crisp), and maybe some ground szechuan peppercorns (I actually have a szechuan peppercorn oil I often use). Mix that up and pour it over your dumplings, done.",

- ~1 lb ground pork
- ~1 lb Napa Cabbage (minced)
- ~3/4 cups water 
- soy sauce to taste (1 tbsp)
- sesame oil to taste (1 tbsp)
- ~1.5 tablespoons corn starch
- ~1/2 tsp salt (for meat)
- Prepared dumpling skins, ~ 1 lb

## process
- Add salt to cabbage and wait, squeeze out water
- Add water, soy sauce, sesame oil, corn starch, salt to ground pork, mix
- Combine
- test salinity of mixture by dropping a bit into boiling water
- Wrap dumplings
- Add to boiling water, remove when fully cooked (floating)

## dipping sauce
- Combine soy sauce, vinegar, and water in a 1:2:1 ratio, add sesame oil to taste
- Garnish with parsley and sesame seeds",

ljrjfom,t1_ljqs3ji,1f0axd1,"Gimme a bit just got home

Here’s the recipe:

Lobster Mac & Cheese

2 lobster tails

2 tbsp butter

3 cloves garlic, crushed

Cajun seasoning (e.g. Black Magic from Spiceology)

Salt & pepper

(Optional) Dry white wine

1 pound dry pasta like fusilli, elbow mac, or cavatappi

4.5 cups whole milk

1/2 cup (8tbsp) butter

1/2 cup flour

3 cheeses: sharp cheddar, low-moisture mozzarella, gruyere—grate them yourself! ~1.5 loose cups of EACH cheese, mix and match, save a few handfuls to add on top


1. Preheat oven to 375, rack in middle of oven. If you have a flat dutch oven like the one in my post, this can all be made in one pot.

2. IF USING LOBSTER: 

- Cut lobster meat into 1” chunks. If using live lobster, boil for 2 minutes so you can remove the meat. 

- Melt 2 tbsp butter and add crushed garlic and saute for 30-60 seconds on medium high heat. Add lobster, Cajun seasoning, salt and pepper and saute for another minute, deglazing with a splash of wine if using. Add a quarter cup water, scraping the pan to get as much of the bits as you can, and remove from pan when meat is opaque.

- Wipe the pan with a damp paper towel to pick up any stray bits that will burn.

3. Melt 1/2 cup (8tbsp) butter in a heavy bottom pan on low heat. Once melted, add flour a little at a time, whisking quickly to prevent clumping, to make a roux.

4. Add milk a little at a time, whisking vigorously until all of the milk is gone. I did about 1/2 a cup at a time at first, then 1 cup at a time until all of the milk was incorporated. 

5. Season the sauce with as much Cajun seasoning as you’d like and some pepper. Wait to salt until after the cheese and pasta are in. Simmer on low heat for 3-5 minutes, stirring from the bottom up to prevent sticking.

6. Turn off heat and add in grated cheese. Stir until fully melted.

7. Cook pasta per package instructions until al dente (try to have this done around the time your cheese sauce is, time depends on pasta).

8. Add pasta to cheese sauce and mix to combine. Taste a couple pieces to adjust for salt. Add in lobster + juices if using.

9. Top the mac with rest of the grated cheese in a flat layer and bake for 25-30 minutes until top is bubbly. 


I honestly left mine in there for like 40 so it was way drier than I wanted it to be, I don’t recommend. Adjust time to your preference though. It’s better to use unsalted butter if you want to fully control salt level but I used Kerrygold salted and it was fine.",

lsu62q1,t3_1g7yitg,1g7yitg,"# Ingredients:

* 1.1 lbs Beef Chuck - diced ( or other stewing cut)
* 1.6 cup Burgundy Red Wine 
* 1 Banana Shallot - finely diced
* 1 handful Fresh Thyme - chopped
* 2 Bay Leaves
* ½ tsp Black Pepper

* 3.5 oz Lardons - (100g) can be substituted with diced pancetta or bacon
* 7 oz Button Mushrooms - (200g) halved
* 15 Pearl Onions
* 2 Carrots, medium size - sliced into half rings
* ½ Celery Stick - finely diced
* 4 Garlic Cloves - sliced
* 2 tbsp Butter - (30g)
* Water
* 1 tbsp Cornflour - dissolved in 2tbsp of water for thickening (if needed)
* 1 tbsp Canola Oil
* Parsley - for garnish
* Boiled Pasta or Potatoes - to serve

1. Start by marinating the diced beef. In a bowl, combine the beef with finely diced shallot, a small bunch of fresh chopped thyme, 2 bay leaves, 1/2 tsp of black pepper, and half a bottle of Burgundy red wine. Cover and refrigerate for 2 hours minimum preferably overnight.
2. The following day, remove the beef from the marinade, reserving the marinade for later. Pat the beef dry, preparing it for searing.
3. To sear the beef, heat 1 tablespoon of oil in a large pan over high heat. Once hot, add the beef, searing it on all sides until browned. Work in batches if necessary to avoid overcrowding the pan, especially if preparing a larger quantity or using a smaller pan.
4. Pour the reserved marinade and 1.27 cups of beef stock into the pan with the beef, bringing the mixture to a boil. Reduce the heat to low, and let it simmer for 2.5 hours. During this time, add extra hot water as needed to almost cover the meat, compensating for evaporation.
5. While the beef simmers, prepare the bacon and vegetables. In a separate pan, fry the bacon lardons until the fat renders out, then add the mushrooms and cook until they begin to brown. Add the pearl onions and 1 and 3/4 tablespoons of butter. Once the butter has melted, add the carrots and celery. Cook until browned, then transfer to a plate and set aside for later.
6. After 2.5 hours, the beef should start to tenderize. Stir in the bacon and vegetable mixture, and continue to simmer for an additional hour. The liquid should reduce by about half during this time.
7. If desired, thicken the sauce by stirring in a mixture of 1 tablespoon of cornflour dissolved in 2 tablespoons of water. Check the seasoning, adjusting with salt and pepper as needed.
8. Serve the Beef Bourguignon over buttery boiled potatoes or pasta. Garnish with Parsley, Enjoy!

>For the jerk chicken I blended 1 white onion, 1 bundle green onions, 3 habanero peppers, garlic, soy sauce, orange juice, lime juice, ginger, brown sugar, nutmeg, allspice, cinnamon and thyme. Covered and marinated the chicken for 24hrs over night. I have a pellet smoker and used competition blend smoker pellets and smoked at 225 for 3 hrs and then the last hr at 350 until the internal temp was 165f. Usually you should used pimento wood for smoking jerk chicken but I didn’t have that and the one I used worked great!

If you look in OP's posting history, you'll see that his food isn't the only thing that's hot af! How can a person be that fit with such delicious looking food around? 

Ok Folks! Put on your bib and prepare to drool because here are a few more of his creations:

Preheat oven to 400º, drizzle bread with olive oil, salt and pepper, bake until golden brown, about 5 minutes- set aside. 

In a large Dutch oven over medium low heat, add oil and butter, melt and add onions and sugar. Stirring frequently, cook onions down until golden brown and jammy, approximately 45-60 minutes. 

Deglaze pan with sherry and red wine, allow to reduce and alcohol to cook off, approximately 5 minutes. Add beef stock, thyme and bay leaf, bring heat to medium high and allow to come to a boil. Reduce heat to low and simmer for 30-45 minutes, season with salt and pepper to taste.

Ladle soup into oven-safe crocks, top with prepared croutons and Gruyère, place in oven for 5-10 minutes until cheese is bubbly and browned nicely.",

lmq837z,t3_1fep9d5,1fep9d5,"👉 MY HUSBAND'S RECIPE FOR AWESOME YORKSHIRE PUDDING 👈

We're a family of 3, so these ingredients make 3 dinner plate sized puds!

Sift 2 cups of standard grade flour into a bowl, make a well in the centre and add a teaspoon of salt, crack in 4 eggs, and lightly beat while gradually adding 1 cup of milk and 4 tablespoons of water. Mix to a smooth batter. 

Chill for one hour in the fridge. 

Preheat oven to 220°C.

Add some meat pan juices (or oil or lard) to Yourshire Pudding tin (my husband used a 25cm round silicone cake pan, but metal pie pan, or roasting dish also works well) and wait until smoking hot in oven. 

Take batter out of the fridge and stir again. Quickly open the oven and pour 1/3 of batter into the pudding pan and close the oven. 

Bake until golden, well risen and crisp around the edges.

Serve with your favourite roast inside it - roast veges (we like potatoes, kumara, squash and parsnips), steamed veges (we like broccoli, cauliflower, carrots and peas), meat (he did a roast chicken this time, but beef is the traditional roast), stuffing (breadcrumbs, chopped onion, butter, salt, pepper, mixed herbs, chopped bacon, egg and water) and lashings of gravy. My husband likes Bistro Rich Brown for perfect gravy every time, and he adds the pan juices from the meat.

ENJOY!!

Sorry I didn't include this in the post, and I could figure out how to edit it! I hope people find it in the comments!",👉👈

lmqaglg,t1_lmoxtly,1fep9d5,"👉 MY HUSBAND'S RECIPE FOR AWESOME YORKSHIRE PUDDING 👈

We're a family of 3, so these ingredients make 3 dinner plate sized puds!

Sift 2 cups of standard grade flour into a bowl, make a well in the centre and add a teaspoon of salt, crack in 4 eggs, and lightly beat while gradually adding 1 cup of milk and 4 tablespoons of water. Mix to a smooth batter. 

Chill for one hour in the fridge. 

Preheat oven to 220°C.

Add some meat pan juices (or oil or lard) to Yourshire Pudding tin (my husband used a 25cm round silicone cake pan, but metal pie pan, or roasting dish also works well) and wait until smoking hot in oven. 

Take batter out of the fridge and stir again. Quickly open the oven and pour 1/3 of batter into the pudding pan and close the oven. 

Bake until golden, well risen and crisp around the edges.

Serve with your favourite roast inside it - roast veges (we like potatoes, kumara, squash and parsnips), steamed veges (we like broccoli, cauliflower, carrots and peas), meat (he did a roast chicken this time, but beef is the traditional roast), stuffing (breadcrumbs, chopped onion, butter, salt, pepper, mixed herbs, chopped bacon, egg and water) and lashings of gravy. My husband likes Bistro Rich Brown for perfect gravy every time, and he adds the pan juices from the meat.

ENJOY!!

lrwaf10,t3_1g3fyj4,1g3fyj4,"Recipe: boil whatever pasta you prefer to el Dente and save some of the pasta water. 

Season salmon with Cajun seasoning of choice and paprika.

Pan fry skin side up for around 4 minutes, then skin side down for another 4 minutes. If not cooked through you can put them up on their sides for a couple minutes. Times vary, set aside when done.

If needed add more oil to the pan and on a low heat add garlic and parsley stems, this helps flavour the oil, (if you’re worried about burning the garlic just do the stems and cook the garlic after the onions) after a few minutes remove parsley stems, and add a tablespoon or little more of butter, turn up the heat abit and in with your onion and cook until translucent. Add cut in half cherry tomato’s and continue to cook briefly, squeeze in tomato paste add some dried oregano, and Italian seasoning mix in and cook down the tomato puree, add in a splash of chicken stock or half your pasta water and stir in for a minute or so. 

Go in with your heavy cream and shred in Parmesan, mix in a bit of parsley and add the rest of your pasta water, and a handful of baby spinach, now let it thicken. (You can add more seasonings at this point if you want, I add more Cajun at this point).

Mix in your pasta and let it reheat in the sauce. Plate it and add the salmon ontop, drizzle with extra sauce and add more parm if you want.

That’s pretty much it, change it around as you like",

Just wash your dishes while you cook, that is how I do it. For example when you put things in the pan, you don't want to constantly touch it anyway so use that time to clean up.",

ltgr7w9,t1_ltg7i7s,1gar3cc,"This is a recipe I have adapted from a few sources, mainly Arnie Tex on youtube. Most measurements are estimates, I don't really measure when preparing and just grab this and that and add what I feel is right so adjust to your taste. This is a large recipe so I have leftovers for days. I also do some things differently than traditional recipes to reduce cleaning steps.

* 4-5lbs boneless  skinless marinated leg meat from your local Mexican Meat Market, or just some boneless skinless thighs if you can't get them.
* 15 guahillo chiles
* 3 ancho chiles
* 3 arbol chiles
* 6 cloves garlic
* half tablespoon of peppercorns
* one white onion
* 4 cloves
* 3 pieces of allspice
* 1 ceylon cinnamon stick
* half tablespoon mexican oregano
* half tablespoon cumin seeds
* two tablespoons achiote powder
* 1/2 small can crushed pineapple, with juice
* 1 small can chipotles in adobo(reduce if you don't want it that spicy, but even with a full can it isn't that spicy)
* 2 tablespoons manteca (rendered pork fat)
* salt to taste

Remove the seeds from the chiles and cut into 1/2 inch pieces with scissors, peel and roughly crush garlic with the flat of a knife, dice the onion.

Use mortar and pestle to crush peppercorns, cloves, allspice, cumin, and cinnamon stick roughly. (A spice grinder will also do fine)

Add \~2 tablespoons of manteca to a pan or stove capable baking dish on medium heat and add the onions, fry until they get translucent and start to brown a little.

Add the chiles stirring continuously until they are fragrant and start to darken slightly, add the garlic and stir for 30 more seconds then add all of the spices you ground in the mortar and pestle and the achiote powder to liven them up. Once they are lightly toasted and fragrant kill the heat and add the half can of crushed pineapple and the chipotles in adobo sauce to deglaze the pan/baking dish.

If you are going to cook the chicken in your stove safe baking dish then add the chicken, cover with foil or a lid, do not stir! If you are baking in another baking dish transfer the contents to it and add the chicken on top and cover, and do not stir! Place in a preheated oven at 350f and cook for 45 minutes, then flip the chicken over and bake covered for another 45 minutes for 90 minutes total. The chicken should release enough juices for them to stew in and to form the sauce, no need to add any stock or water.

Carefully remove the chicken to a bowl making sure to leave all pieces of the chiles in the baking dish, cover the bowl to keep warm as you prepare the sauce. Use an immersion blender by tilting the baking dish and blend the chiles and spices well, then pass the sauce through a medium mesh sieve into a holding container. (you can use a blender if you don't have an immersion blender).

Now transfer the chicken back into the baking dish shredding it as you go and add any accumulated juices to the baking dish as well. Once all the chicken is shredded add some sauce back bit by bit while stirring until desired consistency/sauce level is achieved. This is the time to adjust the salt to your liking. Depending on how much chicken you used and how finely you shredded it you will probably end up with a good amount of leftover sauce, you can add the sauce to pint freezer safe mason jars and it freezes well.",
ltjdin1,t1_ltg7i7s,1gar3cc,"For your marinade –
3 chicken breasts sliced into thin cutlets
4 guajillo chiles
3 ancho chiles
4 chiles de Arbol
1 20oz can pineapple “tidbits”
1 can chipotles in adobo
1 white onion, peeled and quartered
6 cloves
1 tbsp white vinegar
1 tsp Adobo seasoning
1 tsp Mexican oregano
Salt & pepper to taste
Kettle of boiling water

For your tacos –
Marinaded chicken cutlets
15 – 20 corn tortillas
The rest of that white onion, diced
The rest of the pineapple “tidbits”
Cilantro, chopped fine
2 limes cut into wedges
Salsa or hot sauce of your choice
2 tbsp vegetable oil
1 can cooking spray (veg or canola oil work best)

Preheat a skillet or pan over medium heat. I use cast iron for this step, and place a piece of foil inside so I don’t have to clean the skillet after. Remove stems and seeds from chiles. Toast chiles, cloves, and a quarter of the white onion until fragrant. This can go very quickly. Don’t burn your chiles or cloves. Burn the crap out of the onion if you want. Charred onion is delicious. When chiles are toasted, remove to a metal bowl or glass measuring cup and cover with boiling water. Top with plastic wrap or a lid of some sort. Even a kitchen towel will do. Set aside for 15 – 20 minutes.

Throw toasted onions and cloves into a blender or food processor. Add a third cup pineapple juice and about a third of the pineapple “tidbits”. Reserve the rest of the can of pineapple for later. Add 2 – 3 chipotles in adobo, vinegar, Adobo seasoning, Mexican oregano, and your steeped chiles once 15 – 20 minutes has elapsed. Blend until fairly smooth. You can add the steeping water from the chiles to thin out as needed. You want this to be thinner than a paste, but not a liquid sauce or soup base consistency.

In a bowl or other container, coat chicken completely with marinade. Cover and refrigerate for at least an hour, but I’d say no more than 6. The pineapple will start to denature the proteins in the chicken and make it mushy if this sits too long.

Ready to cook? Let’s go!

Preheat a large skillet over medium high heat. Add 2 tbsp vegetable (or other neutral) oil. Remove chicken from marinade and wipe off excess marinade. When pan is hot, add chicken. Cook for 4 – 5 minutes, flip, and cook an additional 3 – 5 minutes or until chicken reaches an internal temperature of at least 165F. Remove to a plate to rest. Remove pan from heat. We’ll come back to it.

Preheat a nonstick pan over medium low heat. When hot, spray with a bit of oil (vegetable oil for me) and add a tortilla. Cook for 45 – 60 seconds. The tortilla will puff a bit and start to brown. Spray the exposed side of the tortilla and flip. Brown the second side for 45 – 60 seconds. Remove and wrap in a towel to keep warm. Repeat the process, stacking the finished tortillas in the towel. This can be done while you are cooking the chicken and preparing for service. Just keep an eye on those tortillas! They can get away from you quick.

Remember our large skillet? Throw that back on medium heat. Add pineapple “tidbits” (I used about half a cup) and a couple ounces of pineapple juice to deglaze. Use a wooden spoon to scrape the fond from the bottom of the pan and mix your pan juices with your pineapple juice.

Dice your chicken cutlets. I went with about half inch cubes. Throw them in the pan with your pineapple and pan sauce. Cook over medium heat, stirring frequently, until warmed through. Time to plate!

This part’s easy. Put tortilla on plate. Put chicken on tortilla. Put whatever you want on top, and enjoy!",

Preheat a skillet or pan over medium heat. I use cast iron for this step, and place a piece of foil inside so I don’t have to clean the skillet after. Remove stems and seeds from chiles. Toast chiles, cloves, and a quarter of the white onion until fragrant. This can go very quickly. Don’t burn your chiles or cloves. Burn the crap out of the onion if you want. Charred onion is delicious. When chiles are toasted, remove to a metal bowl or glass measuring cup and cover with boiling water. Top with plastic wrap or a lid of some sort. Even a kitchen towel will do. Set aside for 15 – 20 minutes.

Throw toasted onions and cloves into a blender or food processor. Add a third cup pineapple juice and about a third of the pineapple “tidbits”. Reserve the rest of the can of pineapple for later. Add 2 – 3 chipotles in adobo, vinegar, Adobo seasoning, Mexican oregano, and your steeped chiles once 15 – 20 minutes has elapsed. Blend until fairly smooth. You can add the steeping water from the chiles to thin out as needed. You want this to be thinner than a paste, but not a liquid sauce or soup base consistency.

In a bowl or other container, coat chicken completely with marinade. Cover and refrigerate for at least an hour, but I’d say no more than 6. The pineapple will start to denature the proteins in the chicken and make it mushy if this sits too long.

Preheat a large skillet over medium high heat. Add 2 tbsp vegetable (or other neutral) oil. Remove chicken from marinade and wipe off excess marinade. When pan is hot, add chicken. Cook for 4 – 5 minutes, flip, and cook an additional 3 – 5 minutes or until chicken reaches an internal temperature of at least 165F. Remove to a plate to rest. Remove pan from heat. We’ll come back to it.

Preheat a nonstick pan over medium low heat. When hot, spray with a bit of oil (vegetable oil for me) and add a tortilla. Cook for 45 – 60 seconds. The tortilla will puff a bit and start to brown. Spray the exposed side of the tortilla and flip. Brown the second side for 45 – 60 seconds. Remove and wrap in a towel to keep warm. Repeat the process, stacking the finished tortillas in the towel. This can be done while you are cooking the chicken and preparing for service. Just keep an eye on those tortillas! They can get away from you quick.

Remember our large skillet? Throw that back on medium heat. Add pineapple “tidbits” (I used about half a cup) and a couple ounces of pineapple juice to deglaze. Use a wooden spoon to scrape the fond from the bottom of the pan and mix your pan juices with your pineapple juice.

Dice your chicken cutlets. I went with about half inch cubes. Throw them in the pan with your pineapple and pan sauce. Cook over medium heat, stirring frequently, until warmed through. Time to plate!

Preheat a nonstick pan over medium low heat. When hot, spray with a bit of oil (vegetable oil for me) and add a tortilla. Cook for 45 – 60 seconds. The tortilla will puff a bit and start to brown. Spray the exposed side of the tortilla and flip. Brown the second side for 45 – 60 seconds. Remove and wrap in a towel to keep warm. Repeat the process, stacking the finished tortillas in the towel. This can be done while you are cooking the chicken and preparing for service. Just keep an eye on those tortillas! They can get away from you quick.

Remember our large skillet? Throw that back on medium heat. Add pineapple “tidbits” (I used about half a cup) and a couple ounces of pineapple juice to deglaze. Use a wooden spoon to scrape the fond from the bottom of the pan and mix your pan juices with your pineapple juice.

Dice your chicken cutlets. I went with about half inch cubes. Throw them in the pan with your pineapple and pan sauce. Cook over medium heat, stirring frequently, until warmed through. Time to plate!

ltjcrhu,t1_ltgwxuf,1gar3cc,"For your marinade –
3 chicken breasts sliced into thin cutlets
4 guajillo chiles
3 ancho chiles
4 chiles de Arbol
1 20oz can pineapple “tidbits”
1 can chipotles in adobo
1 white onion, peeled and quartered
6 cloves
1 tbsp white vinegar
1 tsp Adobo seasoning
1 tsp Mexican oregano
Salt & pepper to taste
Kettle of boiling water

For your tacos –
Marinaded chicken cutlets
15 – 20 corn tortillas
The rest of that white onion, diced
The rest of the pineapple “tidbits”
Cilantro, chopped fine
2 limes cut into wedges
Salsa or hot sauce of your choice
2 tbsp vegetable oil
1 can cooking spray (veg or canola oil work best)

Preheat a skillet or pan over medium heat. I use cast iron for this step, and place a piece of foil inside so I don’t have to clean the skillet after. Remove stems and seeds from chiles. Toast chiles, cloves, and a quarter of the white onion until fragrant. This can go very quickly. Don’t burn your chiles or cloves. Burn the crap out of the onion if you want. Charred onion is delicious. When chiles are toasted, remove to a metal bowl or glass measuring cup and cover with boiling water. Top with plastic wrap or a lid of some sort. Even a kitchen towel will do. Set aside for 15 – 20 minutes.

Throw toasted onions and cloves into a blender or food processor. Add a third cup pineapple juice and about a third of the pineapple “tidbits”. Reserve the rest of the can of pineapple for later. Add 2 – 3 chipotles in adobo, vinegar, Adobo seasoning, Mexican oregano, and your steeped chiles once 15 – 20 minutes has elapsed. Blend until fairly smooth. You can add the steeping water from the chiles to thin out as needed. You want this to be thinner than a paste, but not a liquid sauce or soup base consistency.

In a bowl or other container, coat chicken completely with marinade. Cover and refrigerate for at least an hour, but I’d say no more than 6. The pineapple will start to denature the proteins in the chicken and make it mushy if this sits too long.

m5ds08f,t3_1htjjza,1htjjza,"[Full recipe available here](https://www.plantifulpalate.com/post/homemade-vegan-gnocchi)

Ingredients:

For the Gnocchi:
- 1kg floury potatoes (e.g., Maris Piper), peeled and boiled
- 200g plain flour, plus extra for dusting
- 1 tsp salt

For the Tomato Sauce:
- 2 tbsp olive oil
- 1 large onion, finely chopped
- 3 garlic cloves, minced
- 1 tsp ground cumin
- 1 tsp smoked paprika
- 1/2 tsp chilli flakes (optional)
- 400g canned chopped tomatoes
- 2 tbsp tomato purée
- 1 tsp sugar (optional, to balance acidity)
- Salt and freshly ground black pepper, to taste

For the Plant-Based Cream:
- 150g unsweetened plant-based yoghurt (e.g., coconut or soy)
- 1 tsp lemon juice
- 1/4 tsp garlic powder
- Pinch of salt

For Garnish:
- 2 tbsp fresh parsley, chopped
- Freshly ground black pepper

Method:

1. To make the gnocchi, start by peeling the potatoes using a vegetable peeler. Rinse them under cold water to remove any residual starch. Place the peeled potatoes in a large pot and cover with cold, salted water. Bring to a boil and cook for 15-20 minutes, or until the potatoes are fork-tender but not falling apart. Drain the potatoes and let them sit for a few minutes to release excess steam. Mash the potatoes using a potato ricer or masher until completely smooth, ensuring there are no lumps. Allow them to cool slightly. Gradually mix the flour and salt into the mashed potatoes, adding a little at a time, until a soft dough forms. Knead the mixture gently until it forms a soft dough. Avoid overworking the dough to keep the gnocchi light and fluffy.

2. Divide the dough into four portions. Roll each portion into a long rope about 2cm in diameter, then cut into 2cm pieces. For a classic gnocchi texture, press each piece gently with the back of a fork to create ridges. Dust with a little flour to prevent sticking.

3. Bring a large pot of salted water to a boil. Add the gnocchi in batches and cook until they float to the surface, about 2-3 minutes. Remove with a slotted spoon and set aside.

4. For the tomato sauce, heat olive oil in a large frying pan over medium heat. Add the chopped onion and sauté for 6-8 minutes until softened and translucent. Stir in the minced garlic and cook for an additional 1-2 minutes until fragrant.

5. Add the ground cumin, smoked paprika, and chilli flakes (if using) to the pan, stirring to coat the onion mixture. Cook for 30 seconds to release the spices’ aromas.

6. Stir in the canned tomatoes, tomato purée, and sugar (if needed). Season with salt and black pepper. Simmer the sauce over medium heat for 10-12 minutes, stirring occasionally, until it thickens slightly and the flavours meld together.

7. While the sauce simmers, prepare the plant-based cream by whisking together the yoghurt, lemon juice, garlic powder, and a pinch of salt in a small bowl. Set aside.

8. Add the cooked gnocchi to the tomato sauce, stirring gently to coat them evenly. Simmer for an additional 2-3 minutes to warm through.

9. Transfer the gnocchi and sauce to serving bowls. Add dollops of the plant-based cream on top and garnish with fresh parsley, a drizzle of extra virgin olive oil and a generous sprinkle of freshly ground black pepper.

10. Serve warm and enjoy!",

The further you get from the source, the more it starts to morph into a different dish entirely until eventually it starts turning into a bean soup like this.  The Nola dish is pretty straightforward - the part that people start to miss is the texture of the dish.  It should be cooked long enough that the beans start to split when you stir.  A portion will naturally mash as you stir (or you can manually mash some) and they'll thicken the whole thing so that it's no longer watery like this.  The finished product ends up at a midpoint between these bean soups and refried beans.",

Sausage, red beans, onion, celery, bell pepper, a few bay leaves, cooked in stock, butter used when reducing the mirepoix, all seasoned to taste. 

Beans are traditionally partially mashed to thicken. 

Best way to cheat is to use Blue Runner canned creamed style red beans. Traditional would of course be to start with soaking dry beans and mashing about 1/2 through the process of cooking.

I soak em in lightly brined water overnight, then I sear my sausage, until I get the thick brown oil/meat sauteed my onions and bell peppers, then add in the garlic, add the meat back in stir til it all reduces, next you add in the beans, stir around a bit, then you add the chicken broth, a liter or so, then you go in with the spices, fill with water, bring to boil, low heat and simmer for 4 hours and it'll be thick as fuck, don't need a single other solitary addition.

ltwszzz,t3_1gcj8e2,1gcj8e2,i don’t eat chicken anymore but damn i want,
ltxaj0o,t1_ltv1pct,1gcj8e2,"I am home and ready to share the recipe: 

Start off boiling water then add your elbow macaroni and abit of oil in the pot, and add a little bit of chicken stock too(1/2 cup or so) and cook till al dente. 

In a seperate pan add butter (1 or 2 tablespoons)  and 2 cups of heavy cream on a LOW heat, or around 2 cups. I don’t measure when I’m actually cooking just eyeball. 

Add some handfuls of your favorite cheese (grate it yourself trust me it melts better) could be 1-2-3-4 different types it’s all up to you.

Add seasonings: salt, pepper, paprika, garlic powder, onion powder (if you use these regularly you’ll know how much of each you’d like. If you don’t just do a tablespoon of each)

Continue stirring until you get a nice thickish smooth consistency (you know what to look for it’s melted cheese)

Strain the noodles when they’re done and add to a big bowl with a tablespoon of butter, salt and pepper.

After mixed in chuck in a nice slab of cream cheese (or like a tablespoon or two or 3. Whatever your vibe is that day)

Mix well together until it’s all just doin its thing in that bowl and then lay it out in a baking pan (you can grease it but I didn’t bother) 

Pour all the cheese you melted down over top, add more shredded cheese ontop (layer it if you want/made enough) 

Sprinkle with parsley and paprika.

Put in the oven at 375 for 25 minutes roughly covered, then another 10 or so uncovered. A lot of ovens differ from the next one so just take a peak every now and then and gauge it that way.

Boom you’re done. Enjoy!",

We do also make savoury versions, like cheese scones but never really have them as part of a meal..more a snack. I guess i should try them.

A bit of colour with the sprinkling of herbs is always a nice token touch, but a chimichurri or gremolata drizzled over the steak pieces would have been a nice addition too 😉 
Then again, I'm sure you had some kind of sauce in a pot to the side... Peppercorn perhaps, béarnaise, or even horseradish 🤔

I only have an induction hob in my current place unfortunately, which is good for most things but doesn’t do as well as cast iron. 

I used corn oil primarily and got it up to smoking point in the pan before adding the steaks, and then for the second half of the sear I butter basted them throughout. Then to finish I got the fats up to smoking again and poured the them over the steaks on a wire rack to prepare for serving, which explains the wetness. 

You can see the crust better in this pic though, I think it was decent with plenty of room for improvement - https://ibb.co/4SzVpy5",

Get the same ""grey"" thickness while basting with the butter other second side.

Let rest for 10 minutes off the heat before serving. 

I like to season the steak to match the sides. Southwestern for corn and greens. Excessive salts and garlic for potatoes. Ginger and garlic for rice and roots.",

lnfwrvu,t1_lnciu1m,1fhpzbj,"It's Kenji's recipe from Serious Eats. Typing it out below (per Rule 5).

Ingredients
Kosher salt
1/2 teaspoon (4g) baking soda
4 pounds (about 2 kg) russet or Yukon Gold potatoes, peeled and cut into quarters, sixths, or eighths, depending on size (see note)
5 tablespoons (75ml) extra-virgin olive oil, duck fat, goose fat, or beef fat
Small handful picked fresh rosemary leaves, finely chopped
3 medium cloves garlic, minced
Freshly ground black pepper
Small handful fresh parsley leaves, minced

Directions
Adjust oven rack to center position and preheat oven to 450°F (230°C) (or 400°F (200°C) if using convection). Heat 2 quarts (2L) water in a large pot over high heat until boiling. Add 2 tablespoons kosher salt (about 1 ounce; 25g), baking soda, and potatoes and stir. Return to a boil, reduce to a simmer, and cook until a knife meets little resistance when inserted into a potato chunk, about 10 minutes after returning to a boil.

Meanwhile, combine olive oil, duck fat, or beef fat with rosemary, garlic, and a few grinds of black pepper in a small saucepan and heat over medium heat. Cook, stirring and shaking pan constantly, until garlic just begins to turn golden, about 3 minutes. Immediately strain oil through a fine-mesh strainer set in a large bowl. Set garlic/rosemary mixture aside and reserve separately.

Saute pan filled with finely minced garlic cooked in oil with chopped rosemary
When potatoes are cooked, drain carefully and let them rest in the pot for about 30 seconds to allow excess moisture to evaporate. Transfer to bowl with infused oil, season to taste with a little more salt and pepper, and toss to coat, shaking bowl roughly, until a thick layer of mashed potato–like paste has built up on the potato chunks.

The potatoes in a metal bowl.
Serious Eats / Vicky Wasik
Transfer potatoes to a large rimmed baking sheet and separate them, spreading them out evenly. Transfer to oven and roast, without moving, for 20 minutes. Using a thin, flexible metal spatula to release any stuck potatoes, shake pan and turn potatoes. Continue roasting until potatoes are deep brown and crisp all over, turning and shaking them a few times during cooking, 30 to 40 minutes longer.

The best ever crispy roast potatoes on a metal baking sheet.
Serious Eats / Vicky Wasik
Transfer potatoes to a large bowl and add garlic/rosemary mixture and minced parsley. Toss to coat and season with more salt and pepper to taste. Serve immediately.

Notes
Russet potatoes will produce crisper crusts and fluffier centers. Yukon Golds will be slightly less crisp and have creamier centers, with a darker color and deeper flavor. You can also use a mix of the two.

The potatoes should be cut into very large chunks, at least 2 to 3 inches or so. For medium-sized Yukon Golds, this means cutting them in half crosswise, then splitting each half again to make quarters. For larger Yukon Golds or russets, you can cut the potatoes into chunky sixths or eighths.",

- Stock
First step is to make a stock (you can also just buy store bought stock, won't be as good - dont get broth, it will be too flavorful)
I used left over chicken thigh bones that I roasted in an oven until deeply carmalized and left over shreds of veggies that I browned up in the oven on a sheet tray as well. 
I used 12 cups of stock and added in a tbsp of chicken boullion. Preheat a heavy bottom pot and over medium heat and let come to temp. Throw in your bones and veggies and submerge with liquid.
Bring it up to a simmer over medium, once this is done cover with a lid (Leaving it slightly ajar) and turn the heat to low. You want small simmer bubbles the entire time. No rapid boiling, or still liquid so pay attention to your heat.
You can make a good stock in about 3 - 4 hrs. Significant upgrade to store bought stock. Add salt to taste at the end for your preference. Try not to add salt before since the stock and reduce and be too salty.


- Meat
I suggest using chuck roast, but short rib is a popular choice as well. Take your meat out of the fridge for about 30 minutes and let it start to come up to room-temp. This will lead to better meat browning and you wont have to cook your beef longer to compensate for the cold of the fridge. 
Slice your meat into 2x2 chunks or whatever you prefer. Salt your meat generously, season with a little bit of black pepper. Preheat a heavy bottom pot over medium-high heat and let it come to temp for a few minutes. Add in 2-3 tbsp of olive oil and let come to temp for about another minute after.
Add in your sliced beef to the preheated pot, gently pressing the meat onto the surface to ensure good contact with the pan. Let sear for about 3-4 minutes per side. The meat will release from the pan on its own when a good flavorful crust has formed. If youre having troubles with getting the meat up, just let it sear for a little longer.
Once all sides of your meat chunks have been beautifully browned and seared, set aside and reduce heat to medium.


- Veggies
Add in a tbsp of olive oil and 3 small diced white onions to your pot. You'll want to carmalize the onions for about 25 - 30 minutes. Feel free to go longer, its just time consuming, though the end result is worth it. You'll want to pay attention to your heat adjusting as necessary since we dont want the onions to burn. 
Leave the onions undisturbed until you notice them begin to brown and carmalize the bottom of the pot. Deglaze with about 1 tbsp of water to reincorporate that condensed flavor back into the onions. Repeat this process until you are satisfied with the onions.


- Incorporate meat, veggies, and stock
At this time, preheat oven to 275f or 135c.
Also, preheat a large heavy bottom pot over medium heat on your stovetop, Add in two tbsp oliveoil, Saute 1 diced carrot, 1 diced celery, 6-7 crushed garlic, & 1 peeled, rinsed, and diced celeriac root. Saute for about 10 minutes.
Add in 2-3 tbsp of tomato paste and mix, deglaze with water when it starts to carmalize on the bottom of your pot, should take about 3 - 4 minutes to get a deep browning of tomato paste over the veggies
Add in 1 and a half - 2 cups of red wine to deglaze (I went with tempranillo for a deep flavor), let the alcohol cook out and simmer the wine. You'll smell the alcohol cooking out.
Return your browned meat to the pot and cover with enough stock to submerge your beef. Add in two springs thyme, and one bay leaf. (more bay flavor released when slicing it down the middle)
Turn heat on med high and bring to a slight boil. Once it does, turn the heat off, cover with an oven-safe lid and place in your preheated 275f oven. Make sure to leave the lid slightly ajar and not fully on the pot.
Set a timer for 3 hrs and 30 minutes. Once timer is up, you'll want to get a temperature reading on the beef. Target is around 205f (96.1c) to break down the collagen in the chuck roast to make it real tender, I believe the same target temp for short-rib as well. 
Remove all your beef from the braising liquid and set aside. Strain your braising liquid through a fine mesh strainer or chinois, feel free to use the veggies that you cooked the meat broth in your final dish.


- Polenta
Fine dice 2 large shallots and 3-4 garlic cloves and sautee them with a little bit of olive oil over medium heat.
Bring two cups of milk to a boil while stirring so it doesnt burn on the bottom of the pan, and add in a tsp of salt
Once at a boil, slowly whisk in about 1/2 to 1 cup of polenta, stirring continuously. If you want more, adjust the milk and polenta ratio, but keep in mind the polenta will expand.  
After about 3 - 5 minutes in a boil, remove from heat and cover with a lid. The polenta grain should be slightly swollen and creamy
After about 5 minutes or so, throw in around 2 tbsp of salted butter and 75g - 100g of smoked white cheddar w/ black pepper and stir to melt and incorporate.


- Sauce  
Add in a few cups of your braising liquid from the beef. Now, just reduce your sauce until it is the right flavor and consistency checking constantly.
If you're worried about your sauce being too flavorful, turn the temp to low so it doesn't condense and reduce further. Add 1 - 2 tbsp cornstarch in a small cup with 1 - 2 tbsp of water and mix. Pour in half of this and incorporate into your sauce.
Turn the heat up to medium low to simmer and thicken. If your sauce isn't thick enough, add in the rest of your cornstarch slurry. Sauce consistency should coat the back of your spoon (nappe)


- Gremolatta
Finely mince 2 parts italian parsley leaves, the zest of one whole lemon, and grate one garlic clove and mix. This is your topping.

Once at a boil, slowly whisk in about 1/2 to 1 cup of polenta, stirring continuously. If you want more, adjust the milk and polenta ratio, but keep in mind the polenta will expand.  
After about 3 - 5 minutes in a boil, remove from heat and cover with a lid. The polenta grain should be slightly swollen and creamy
After about 5 minutes or so, throw in around 2 tbsp of salted butter and 75g - 100g of smoked white cheddar w/ black pepper and stir to melt and incorporate.

- Sauce  
Add in a few cups of your braising liquid from the beef. Now, just reduce your sauce until it is the right flavor and consistency checking constantly.
If you're worried about your sauce being too flavorful, turn the temp to low so it doesn't condense and reduce further. Add 1 - 2 tbsp cornstarch in a small cup with 1 - 2 tbsp of water and mix. Pour in half of this and incorporate into your sauce.
Turn the heat up to medium low to simmer and thicken. If your sauce isn't thick enough, add in the rest of your cornstarch slurry. Sauce consistency should coat the back of your spoon (nappe)

- Stock
First step is to make a stock (you can also just buy store bought stock, won't be as good - dont get broth, it will be too flavorful)
I used left over chicken thigh bones that I roasted in an oven until deeply carmalized and left over shreds of veggies that I browned up in the oven on a sheet tray as well. 
I used 12 cups of stock and added in a tbsp of chicken boullion. Preheat a heavy bottom pot and over medium heat and let come to temp. Throw in your bones and veggies and submerge with liquid.
Bring it up to a simmer over medium, once this is done cover with a lid (Leaving it slightly ajar) and turn the heat to low. You want small simmer bubbles the entire time. No rapid boiling, or still liquid so pay attention to your heat.
You can make a good stock in about 3 - 4 hrs. Significant upgrade to store bought stock. Add salt to taste at the end for your preference. Try not to add salt before since the stock and reduce and be too salty.

- Meat
I suggest using chuck roast, but short rib is a popular choice as well. Take your meat out of the fridge for about 30 minutes and let it start to come up to room-temp. This will lead to better meat browning and you wont have to cook your beef longer to compensate for the cold of the fridge. 
Slice your meat into 2x2 chunks or whatever you prefer. Salt your meat generously, season with a little bit of black pepper. Preheat a heavy bottom pot over medium-high heat and let it come to temp for a few minutes. Add in 2-3 tbsp of olive oil and let come to temp for about another minute after.
Add in your sliced beef to the preheated pot, gently pressing the meat onto the surface to ensure good contact with the pan. Let sear for about 3-4 minutes per side. The meat will release from the pan on its own when a good flavorful crust has formed. If youre having troubles with getting the meat up, just let it sear for a little longer.
Once all sides of your meat chunks have been beautifully browned and seared, set aside and reduce heat to medium.

- Veggies
Add in a tbsp of olive oil and 3 small diced white onions to your pot. You'll want to carmalize the onions for about 25 - 30 minutes. Feel free to go longer, its just time consuming, though the end result is worth it. You'll want to pay attention to your heat adjusting as necessary since we dont want the onions to burn. 
Leave the onions undisturbed until you notice them begin to brown and carmalize the bottom of the pot. Deglaze with about 1 tbsp of water to reincorporate that condensed flavor back into the onions. Repeat this process until you are satisfied with the onions.

- Incorporate meat, veggies, and stock
At this time, preheat oven to 275f or 135c.
Also, preheat a large heavy bottom pot over medium heat on your stovetop, Add in two tbsp oliveoil, Saute 1 diced carrot, 1 diced celery, 6-7 crushed garlic, & 1 peeled, rinsed, and diced celeriac root. Saute for about 10 minutes.
Add in 2-3 tbsp of tomato paste and mix, deglaze with water when it starts to carmalize on the bottom of your pot, should take about 3 - 4 minutes to get a deep browning of tomato paste over the veggies
Add in 1 and a half - 2 cups of red wine to deglaze (I went with tempranillo for a deep flavor), let the alcohol cook out and simmer the wine. You'll smell the alcohol cooking out.
Return your browned meat to the pot and cover with enough stock to submerge your beef. Add in two springs thyme, and one bay leaf. (more bay flavor released when slicing it down the middle)
Turn heat on med high and bring to a slight boil. Once it does, turn the heat off, cover with an oven-safe lid and place in your preheated 275f oven. Make sure to leave the lid slightly ajar and not fully on the pot.
Set a timer for 3 hrs and 30 minutes. Once timer is up, you'll want to get a temperature reading on the beef. Target is around 205f (96.1c) to break down the collagen in the chuck roast to make it real tender, I believe the same target temp for short-rib as well. 
Remove all your beef from the braising liquid and set aside. Strain your braising liquid through a fine mesh strainer or chinois, feel free to use the veggies that you cooked the meat broth in your final dish.

- Polenta
Fine dice 2 large shallots and 3-4 garlic cloves and sautee them with a little bit of olive oil over medium heat.

Bring it up to a simmer over medium, once this is done cover with a lid (Leaving it slightly ajar) and turn the heat to low. You want small simmer bubbles the entire time. No rapid boiling, or still liquid so pay attention to your heat.
You can make a good stock in about 3 - 4 hrs. Significant upgrade to store bought stock. Add salt to taste at the end for your preference. Try not to add salt before since the stock and reduce and be too salty.

- Meat
I suggest using chuck roast, but short rib is a popular choice as well. Take your meat out of the fridge for about 30 minutes and let it start to come up to room-temp. This will lead to better meat browning and you wont have to cook your beef longer to compensate for the cold of the fridge. 
Slice your meat into 2x2 chunks or whatever you prefer. Salt your meat generously, season with a little bit of black pepper. Preheat a heavy bottom pot over medium-high heat and let it come to temp for a few minutes. Add in 2-3 tbsp of olive oil and let come to temp for about another minute after.
Add in your sliced beef to the preheated pot, gently pressing the meat onto the surface to ensure good contact with the pan. Let sear for about 3-4 minutes per side. The meat will release from the pan on its own when a good flavorful crust has formed. If youre having troubles with getting the meat up, just let it sear for a little longer.
Once all sides of your meat chunks have been beautifully browned and seared, set aside and reduce heat to medium.

- Veggies
Add in a tbsp of olive oil and 3 small diced white onions to your pot. You'll want to carmalize the onions for about 25 - 30 minutes. Feel free to go longer, its just time consuming, though the end result is worth it. You'll want to pay attention to your heat adjusting as necessary since we dont want the onions to burn. 
Leave the onions undisturbed until you notice them begin to brown and carmalize the bottom of the pot. Deglaze with about 1 tbsp of water to reincorporate that condensed flavor back into the onions. Repeat this process until you are satisfied with the onions.

- Incorporate meat, veggies, and stock
At this time, preheat oven to 275f or 135c.
Also, preheat a large heavy bottom pot over medium heat on your stovetop, Add in two tbsp oliveoil, Saute 1 diced carrot, 1 diced celery, 6-7 crushed garlic, & 1 peeled, rinsed, and diced celeriac root. Saute for about 10 minutes.
Add in 2-3 tbsp of tomato paste and mix, deglaze with water when it starts to carmalize on the bottom of your pot, should take about 3 - 4 minutes to get a deep browning of tomato paste over the veggies
Add in 1 and a half - 2 cups of red wine to deglaze (I went with tempranillo for a deep flavor), let the alcohol cook out and simmer the wine. You'll smell the alcohol cooking out.
Return your browned meat to the pot and cover with enough stock to submerge your beef. Add in two springs thyme, and one bay leaf. (more bay flavor released when slicing it down the middle)
Turn heat on med high and bring to a slight boil. Once it does, turn the heat off, cover with an oven-safe lid and place in your preheated 275f oven. Make sure to leave the lid slightly ajar and not fully on the pot.
Set a timer for 3 hrs and 30 minutes. Once timer is up, you'll want to get a temperature reading on the beef. Target is around 205f (96.1c) to break down the collagen in the chuck roast to make it real tender, I believe the same target temp for short-rib as well. 
Remove all your beef from the braising liquid and set aside. Strain your braising liquid through a fine mesh strainer or chinois, feel free to use the veggies that you cooked the meat broth in your final dish.

- Polenta
Fine dice 2 large shallots and 3-4 garlic cloves and sautee them with a little bit of olive oil over medium heat.
Bring two cups of milk to a boil while stirring so it doesnt burn on the bottom of the pan, and add in a tsp of salt
Once at a boil, slowly whisk in about 1/2 to 1 cup of polenta, stirring continuously. If you want more, adjust the milk and polenta ratio, but keep in mind the polenta will expand.  
After about 3 - 5 minutes in a boil, remove from heat and cover with a lid. The polenta grain should be slightly swollen and creamy
After about 5 minutes or so, throw in around 2 tbsp of salted butter and 75g - 100g of smoked white cheddar w/ black pepper and stir to melt and incorporate.

- Sauce  
Add in a few cups of your braising liquid from the beef. Now, just reduce your sauce until it is the right flavor and consistency checking constantly.
If you're worried about your sauce being too flavorful, turn the temp to low so it doesn't condense and reduce further. Add 1 - 2 tbsp cornstarch in a small cup with 1 - 2 tbsp of water and mix. Pour in half of this and incorporate into your sauce.
Turn the heat up to medium low to simmer and thicken. If your sauce isn't thick enough, add in the rest of your cornstarch slurry. Sauce consistency should coat the back of your spoon (nappe)

- Gremolatta
Finely mince 2 parts italian parsley leaves, the zest of one whole lemon, and grate one garlic clove and mix. This is your topping.

- Stock
First step is to make a stock (you can also just buy store bought stock, won't be as good - dont get broth, it will be too flavorful)
I used left over chicken thigh bones that I roasted in an oven until deeply carmalized and left over shreds of veggies that I browned up in the oven on a sheet tray as well. 
I used 12 cups of stock and added in a tbsp of chicken boullion. Preheat a heavy bottom pot and over medium heat and let come to temp. Throw in your bones and veggies and submerge with liquid.
Bring it up to a simmer over medium, once this is done cover with a lid (Leaving it slightly ajar) and turn the heat to low. You want small simmer bubbles the entire time. No rapid boiling, or still liquid so pay attention to your heat.
You can make a good stock in about 3 - 4 hrs. Significant upgrade to store bought stock. Add salt to taste at the end for your preference. Try not to add salt before since the stock and reduce and be too salty.

- Meat
I suggest using chuck roast, but short rib is a popular choice as well. Take your meat out of the fridge for about 30 minutes and let it start to come up to room-temp. This will lead to better meat browning and you wont have to cook your beef longer to compensate for the cold of the fridge. 
Slice your meat into 2x2 chunks or whatever you prefer. Salt your meat generously, season with a little bit of black pepper. Preheat a heavy bottom pot over medium-high heat and let it come to temp for a few minutes. Add in 2-3 tbsp of olive oil and let come to temp for about another minute after.
Add in your sliced beef to the preheated pot, gently pressing the meat onto the surface to ensure good contact with the pan. Let sear for about 3-4 minutes per side. The meat will release from the pan on its own when a good flavorful crust has formed. If youre having troubles with getting the meat up, just let it sear for a little longer.
Once all sides of your meat chunks have been beautifully browned and seared, set aside and reduce heat to medium.

- Veggies
Add in a tbsp of olive oil and 3 small diced white onions to your pot. You'll want to carmalize the onions for about 25 - 30 minutes. Feel free to go longer, its just time consuming, though the end result is worth it. You'll want to pay attention to your heat adjusting as necessary since we dont want the onions to burn. 
Leave the onions undisturbed until you notice them begin to brown and carmalize the bottom of the pot. Deglaze with about 1 tbsp of water to reincorporate that condensed flavor back into the onions. Repeat this process until you are satisfied with the onions.

- Incorporate meat, veggies, and stock
At this time, preheat oven to 275f or 135c.
Also, preheat a large heavy bottom pot over medium heat on your stovetop, Add in two tbsp oliveoil, Saute 1 diced carrot, 1 diced celery, 6-7 crushed garlic, & 1 peeled, rinsed, and diced celeriac root. Saute for about 10 minutes.
Add in 2-3 tbsp of tomato paste and mix, deglaze with water when it starts to carmalize on the bottom of your pot, should take about 3 - 4 minutes to get a deep browning of tomato paste over the veggies
Add in 1 and a half - 2 cups of red wine to deglaze (I went with tempranillo for a deep flavor), let the alcohol cook out and simmer the wine. You'll smell the alcohol cooking out.
Return your browned meat to the pot and cover with enough stock to submerge your beef. Add in two springs thyme, and one bay leaf. (more bay flavor released when slicing it down the middle)
Turn heat on med high and bring to a slight boil. Once it does, turn the heat off, cover with an oven-safe lid and place in your preheated 275f oven. Make sure to leave the lid slightly ajar and not fully on the pot.
Set a timer for 3 hrs and 30 minutes. Once timer is up, you'll want to get a temperature reading on the beef. Target is around 205f (96.1c) to break down the collagen in the chuck roast to make it real tender, I believe the same target temp for short-rib as well. 
Remove all your beef from the braising liquid and set aside. Strain your braising liquid through a fine mesh strainer or chinois, feel free to use the veggies that you cooked the meat broth in your final dish.

- Polenta
Fine dice 2 large shallots and 3-4 garlic cloves and sautee them with a little bit of olive oil over medium heat.
Bring two cups of milk to a boil while stirring so it doesnt burn on the bottom of the pan, and add in a tsp of salt
Once at a boil, slowly whisk in about 1/2 to 1 cup of polenta, stirring continuously. If you want more, adjust the milk and polenta ratio, but keep in mind the polenta will expand.  
After about 3 - 5 minutes in a boil, remove from heat and cover with a lid. The polenta grain should be slightly swollen and creamy
After about 5 minutes or so, throw in around 2 tbsp of salted butter and 75g - 100g of smoked white cheddar w/ black pepper and stir to melt and incorporate.

- Sauce  
Add in a few cups of your braising liquid from the beef. Now, just reduce your sauce until it is the right flavor and consistency checking constantly.
If you're worried about your sauce being too flavorful, turn the temp to low so it doesn't condense and reduce further. Add 1 - 2 tbsp cornstarch in a small cup with 1 - 2 tbsp of water and mix. Pour in half of this and incorporate into your sauce.
Turn the heat up to medium low to simmer and thicken. If your sauce isn't thick enough, add in the rest of your cornstarch slurry. Sauce consistency should coat the back of your spoon (nappe)

- Gremolatta
Finely mince 2 parts italian parsley leaves, the zest of one whole lemon, and grate one garlic clove and mix. This is your topping.

Add in a tbsp of olive oil and 3 small diced white onions to your pot. You'll want to carmalize the onions for about 25 - 30 minutes. Feel free to go longer, its just time consuming, though the end result is worth it. You'll want to pay attention to your heat adjusting as necessary since we dont want the onions to burn. 
Leave the onions undisturbed until you notice them begin to brown and carmalize the bottom of the pot. Deglaze with about 1 tbsp of water to reincorporate that condensed flavor back into the onions. Repeat this process until you are satisfied with the onions.

- Incorporate meat, veggies, and stock
At this time, preheat oven to 275f or 135c.
Also, preheat a large heavy bottom pot over medium heat on your stovetop, Add in two tbsp oliveoil, Saute 1 diced carrot, 1 diced celery, 6-7 crushed garlic, & 1 peeled, rinsed, and diced celeriac root. Saute for about 10 minutes.
Add in 2-3 tbsp of tomato paste and mix, deglaze with water when it starts to carmalize on the bottom of your pot, should take about 3 - 4 minutes to get a deep browning of tomato paste over the veggies
Add in 1 and a half - 2 cups of red wine to deglaze (I went with tempranillo for a deep flavor), let the alcohol cook out and simmer the wine. You'll smell the alcohol cooking out.
Return your browned meat to the pot and cover with enough stock to submerge your beef. Add in two springs thyme, and one bay leaf. (more bay flavor released when slicing it down the middle)
Turn heat on med high and bring to a slight boil. Once it does, turn the heat off, cover with an oven-safe lid and place in your preheated 275f oven. Make sure to leave the lid slightly ajar and not fully on the pot.
Set a timer for 3 hrs and 30 minutes. Once timer is up, you'll want to get a temperature reading on the beef. Target is around 205f (96.1c) to break down the collagen in the chuck roast to make it real tender, I believe the same target temp for short-rib as well. 
Remove all your beef from the braising liquid and set aside. Strain your braising liquid through a fine mesh strainer or chinois, feel free to use the veggies that you cooked the meat broth in your final dish.

- Polenta
Fine dice 2 large shallots and 3-4 garlic cloves and sautee them with a little bit of olive oil over medium heat.
Bring two cups of milk to a boil while stirring so it doesnt burn on the bottom of the pan, and add in a tsp of salt
Once at a boil, slowly whisk in about 1/2 to 1 cup of polenta, stirring continuously. If you want more, adjust the milk and polenta ratio, but keep in mind the polenta will expand.  
After about 3 - 5 minutes in a boil, remove from heat and cover with a lid. The polenta grain should be slightly swollen and creamy
After about 5 minutes or so, throw in around 2 tbsp of salted butter and 75g - 100g of smoked white cheddar w/ black pepper and stir to melt and incorporate.

- Sauce  
Add in a few cups of your braising liquid from the beef. Now, just reduce your sauce until it is the right flavor and consistency checking constantly.
If you're worried about your sauce being too flavorful, turn the temp to low so it doesn't condense and reduce further. Add 1 - 2 tbsp cornstarch in a small cup with 1 - 2 tbsp of water and mix. Pour in half of this and incorporate into your sauce.
Turn the heat up to medium low to simmer and thicken. If your sauce isn't thick enough, add in the rest of your cornstarch slurry. Sauce consistency should coat the back of your spoon (nappe)

- Gremolatta
Finely mince 2 parts italian parsley leaves, the zest of one whole lemon, and grate one garlic clove and mix. This is your topping.

Plate up and enjoy!",
lr4vkrt,t1_lr2fsls,1fzegax,"Of course!

- Stock
First step is to make a stock (you can also just buy store bought stock, won't be as good - dont get broth, it will be too flavorful)
I used left over chicken thigh bones that I roasted in an oven until deeply carmalized and left over shreds of veggies that I browned up in the oven on a sheet tray as well. 
I used 12 cups of stock and added in a tbsp of chicken boullion. Preheat a heavy bottom pot and over medium heat and let come to temp. Throw in your bones and veggies and submerge with liquid.
Bring it up to a simmer over medium, once this is done cover with a lid (Leaving it slightly ajar) and turn the heat to low. You want small simmer bubbles the entire time. No rapid boiling, or still liquid so pay attention to your heat.
You can make a good stock in about 3 - 4 hrs. Significant upgrade to store bought stock. Add salt to taste at the end for your preference. Try not to add salt before since the stock and reduce and be too salty.

- Meat
I suggest using chuck roast, but short rib is a popular choice as well. Take your meat out of the fridge for about 30 minutes and let it start to come up to room-temp. This will lead to better meat browning and you wont have to cook your beef longer to compensate for the cold of the fridge. 
Slice your meat into 2x2 chunks or whatever you prefer. Salt your meat generously, season with a little bit of black pepper. Preheat a heavy bottom pot over medium-high heat and let it come to temp for a few minutes. Add in 2-3 tbsp of olive oil and let come to temp for about another minute after.
Add in your sliced beef to the preheated pot, gently pressing the meat onto the surface to ensure good contact with the pan. Let sear for about 3-4 minutes per side. The meat will release from the pan on its own when a good flavorful crust has formed. If youre having troubles with getting the meat up, just let it sear for a little longer.

lnzm1nx,t1_lnzjqun,1fkuqr2,They're really good but the look is deceiving. They're filled with a sweet paste and often have whole salted duck egg yolks inside. They're super high calorie I'd recommend cutting one in half or even quarters and sharing.,

lqzci1r,t3_1fz5h7y,1fz5h7y,"I used to make a lot of club sandwiches in a a bar kitchen. They’re kind of technical if you want them to look pretty (and be more pleasant to bite).

The turkey in this sandwich needs to be laid out more evenly towards the crust (not folded). It should also be next to the bacon so that the middle bread is centered in the stack.

A bit more tomato and lettuce would be nice.

Lastly, if the ham has to be there (lots of folks expect it)….the amount should be reduced by about 1/3.

Full disclaimer, I season by eye. Season with love!

Preheat the oven to 425F

Get 1 large butternut squash, 1 large yellow onion, 2 French shallots, a head of garlic with the top sliced off (turn it cut side down to the baking sheet), 2 sprigs of rosemary, olive oil, S+P and seasonings of your choice (I used ""Roasted pepper & garlic"" by Club House, onion powder, parsley flakes and white balsamic).

Roast that for about 30 minutes (every oven is different, I'd keep an eye on it)

Once roasted and softened, discard the garlic and rosemary and transfer the rest into a big pot with chicken stock and water. (I would say 2:1 ratio, water to stock)

Bring to a boil and then let simmer until the vegetables are nice and tender.

Buzz everything with an emulsion blender and add some heavy cream, chopped parsley, and season with cumin, lemon juice, and zest, the seasonings from when you roasted.

It's sort of like an American beef version of schnitzel.

Bacon gravy is I'm guessing gravy that's made also using bacon lol. The gravy is like a bechamel but using meat fat.",
ktl0wb0,t1_kti7skn,1b7enxj,Me too!,
ktix420,t1_ktibdb5,1b7enxj,"
I used ribeye but you can use any cut of beef you like.    Tougher cuts will work well since your gonna tenderize and pound down the meat with a mallet. 

I dont have a mallet, so I used the back of a sturdy pan with a piece of parchment paper over the steak and it did the job.  Season both sides with salt and lots of black pepper, set aside. 

In bowl large enough to dip the steak in, make an eggwash with an egg and a couple tablepoons of milk.  

In another pan, mix 1 cup of flour and with a half teaspoon each of garlic and onion powder, black pepper and 1/4 tsp of salt.


Dredge both sides of the steak with flour mix, then the eggwash then the flour again.  Shake off excess flour and deep fry in 375*f oil for 4-6 minutes on each side or until golden brown. 



Gravy:

3-4 strips of bacon chopped up 
3 tbsp butter 
1/4 cup flour 
2 cups milk 
1/4 tsp garlic powder 
1/2 tsp onion powder  
Salt and pepper to taste

In a metal safe skillet, cook the bacon over medium/low head until brown and fat has been rendered.   Set the bacon bits aside.   Remove bacon fat and reserve 1 tablespoon of bacon fat in the pan.   


Bring the skillet to medium/low heat and add 3 tbps of butter and using a whisk, mix in a 1/4 cup of flour, cook for a minute or two, but do not brown.   Once the flour is mixed, turn the stove on low gently whisk in two cups of milk.  When you don't see any clumps of flour you can turn up the heat to medium and add in the bacon bits, garlic and onion powder.  Simmer for about 5 minutes or until thickened.  Season with salt and pepper to taste.   

You can simmer the gravy down on low heat you want it thicker or add more milk if you want it runnier. Enjoy!

lhjyywv,t1_lhiu27b,1ep809s,I rented an airbnb on the GA coast and they provided a trap to throw off the pier. Basically we were told to just let some chicken sit out in the sun all day and throw it in the trap. Its designed to let them in but not out. We caught a BUNCH of blue crab and made crab cakes also.,
lhjefv5,t1_lhiu27b,1ep809s,Crab traps or tie a chicken drumstick to a string and toss it in then slowly pull and scoop them up.,
lhjop2b,t1_lhiu27b,1ep809s,"If there’s a rocky area, and you’re a risk taking dumbass who doesn’t mind the occasional cut, scratch and bruise, you go hunting with a pair of tongs.

Besides that, crab pots, which are basically lobster traps but wider and made for crabs.",
lhjpte1,t1_lhiu27b,1ep809s,"Easiest way are baited flat traps that close into a metal box when you pull them up from the bay floor. You can do this right off a dock. There are also box traps that have a chicken wire path in that the crabs can't figure out how to get back out.

You can also run a rope line that sinks to the bottom with bait every so many feet. When you bring the line up, the crabs are too greedy and will come up with the bait if they were eating it. This requires trawling in a boat to run the line.",
lhkcvs0,t1_lhiu27b,1ep809s,Either crab traps or a trot line. If you're trying to catch a lot at once you usually use a trot line which is a long line of rope that you attach bait to. You pull the line up out of the water while you're moving along the line in your boat and scoop the crabs into your boat with a net. Need more than one person for this. https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trotline,

[Based on Ramen Lord's book which can be found here](https://www.reddit.com/r/ramen/comments/hv9niv/my_brother_and_i_just_completed_a_free_ebook_on/).

For the broth (if you don't want to make the broth, skip this section: Two onions, 1 carrot, one head of garlic along with all bones that were saved up from meals since the last Ramen meal. Throw it into the oven to brown a bit, then into a pressure cooker. Cover with water, add a handful of pepper corns, 2 cloves, a bay leaf, and a star anis. Cook on high pressure for as long as you can afford. Minimum 1 hour, max 3 hours. When done, sift the solids outs. The broth should be dark and flavorful.

For protein I use chicken thighs. Debone (bones to be used in the previous step) and cook in a stainless steel skin down with a spoon of oil. Crisp up the skin, all the fat from the chicken will pool at the bottom of the pot.

Let the pot cool down, then add a spoonful of miso paste, mix the miso and the oil until everything is emulsified. Add the broth (make sure it's *not* boiling, otherwise it will ruin the miso) and mix everything together.

Cook instant noodles in separate water, then add them to the broth.

Oven bake some onions and bellpepper strips as toppings. Add them as toppings along with some spring onions. Cut the chicken into strips and add these as well. If you feel like it, a soft boiled egg too.",

lwkph7g,t1_lwknepk,1go56jl,"If you end up using it, would be great if you could share a picture of the result (and any changes you made). Always great to see what people do with these recipes.

Does anyone know what happens to the rest of the sturgeon after they remove the egg sacks? Is the rest of the body utilized, or is caviar a wasteful food?

I think “uncultured” is a tricky term when it comes to food. I find it is often associated with *certain* forms of food (including presentation, plating, handling etc.) from *certain* areas when people refer to this term.

Im pretty good at fishing out the fkn douches trynna show off lol and abut the uncultured reference I agree that the term gets thrown around way too loosely and I for one have never called or assumed that people were that because I grew up with no real money so certain types of foods weren’t available to us and weren’t in my household and I didn’t know about certain foods and delicacies growing up so sometimes you might want to try something or end up liking something but you just aren’t exposed to it so you don’t even know if it exist let alone like it ya know? And to your comment inquiring about the wasteful food, there are 2 ways to make caviar one is the wasteful way in where they kill the fish afterwards and the other is to give it a c section and take the eggs out and the fish keeps on living so I always order at places that serve caviar in the vivace method in which the fish gets a c section and lives afterwards",

lm7shhj,t1_lm7rqev,1fccdtv,"Blondies: I made this recipe by combining a couple different recipes - I have a professional history as a pastry chef but fair warning this is my own experimental recipe lol. Turned out well if I do say so myself 😂

3/4 cup unsalted butter 

50g white chocolate (to melt with butter)

1 cup dark brown sugar 

2 egg yolks 

2 tsp vanilla 

3/4 cup pure pumpkin purée (blot some of the excess moisture with a paper towel) 

~1 tbsp of pumpkin spice (I didn’t have any so I just did a mix of cinnamon, ginger, clove and nutmeg)

1 1/2 cups AP flour 

1/2 tsp baking soda 

1 tsp kosher salt 

150g white chocolate chips 

Brown 3/4 cup of unsalted butter over medium heat. Careful not to burn it, take off the heat once you start to see some browned bits at the bottom, and it will continue to brown with the heat of the pot for a few mins. Once browned let cool for 5-10 mins then whisk in 50g white chocolate. 

Whisk brown sugar and egg yolks until pale, then add vanilla and pumpkin purée 

Mix melted butter/chocolate with brown sugar mixture until combined. 

Sift in all dry ingredients and then fold together. When the flour is 90% combined add white choco chips. 

Bake in a metal 8x8 pan lined with parchment at 350° for approx 28-32 mins. Until toothpick comes out with crumbs clinging but no wet batter. 

Cream cheese frosting: 

150g butter browned (cooled until solid but malleable) 

250g cream cheese (room temp) 

1 tsp vanilla 

Pinch of salt 

Splash of lemon juice 

125g icing sugar 

50g brown sugar 

Mix brown butter with vanilla, lemon, and salt until fluffy then add in chunks of cream cheese and mix until combined but careful not to mix tooooo much. Add icing sugar then brown sugar.

lmd3lla,t1_lmclwc8,1fccdtv,"Personally I just used a small offset spatula (which tbh probably wasn’t the best tool for the job lol - ideally I would have used a large flat edged scraper but I don’t have one at home)

For getting no crumbs in the icing the most important thing is making sure whatever baked good you’re frosting is properly chilled and that your layer of frosting is thick enough and the right consistency :) if your frosting is too stiff/cold you’ll just rip apart the cake or whatever it is underneath, if you don’t have enough icing no matter what you do you’re pretty much always gonna have crumbs. And you want to be gentle with it, if your tool is scraping at the cake you’re gonna get crumbs, you kinda want to aim to keep your tool a couple mm away from the cake at all times and only touch frosting. I have been a full time cake/cookie decorator for a few years so perhaps just practice as well lol. ",

lpc4ba1,t3_1fre7in,1fre7in,"Habibi! Who else loves Chicken Shawarma?

I just made the most delicious Chicken Shawarma with homemade Laffa Bread, and I can't wait to share the recipe with you! Juicy, flavorful chicken, wrapped in soft laffa, topped with fresh veggies, tangy pickles, and a drizzle of garlic sauce... it’s seriously next-level.

# Ingredients for the Chicken Shawarma

* 650 g boneless - skinless chicken thighs
* Juice of half a lemon
* 3 garlic cloves - minced
* 1 tsp minced ginger
* 1 tbsp extra virgin olive oil - for the marinade
* Half of the Lebanese spice blend
* Iceberg lettuce - shredded
* Cherry tomatoes - quartered
* Cucumber - halved and sliced
* Pickled element of the salad - lacto-fermented cucumbers or red sauerkraut
* Toum - Lebanese garlic sauce made of yoghurt, garlic, olive oil, and lemon juice
* Chilli sauce
* Optional: Drizzle of tahini sauce or a sprinkle of sumac for extra flavor

# How to Prepare Chicken Shawarma:

1. Prepare the chicken thighs by cutting each thigh into halves. Marinate the meat in a bowl with half the Lebanese spice blend, 1 tbsp extra virgin olive oil, lemon juice, minced garlic, and ginger. Allow the meat to marinate in the refrigerator for at least **2 hours or overnight (up to 24 hours for optimal flavor)**.
2. Oven Cooking: Skewer the marinated meat onto metal skewers and place them in a roasting dish. Preheat the oven to **250°C**. Grill the skewers for **10-12 minutes**, turning once halfway, until the meat is charred and cooked through.
3. Alternative Cooking Method: If you don’t have an oven or grill, you can cook the chicken in a cast-iron skillet on medium-high heat. Heat 1 tbsp of olive oil in the skillet and cook the chicken pieces in batches until well-charred and cooked through **(about 6-8 minutes per side)**. This method replicates the smoky effect of grilling.
4. Once the meat is fully cooked, remove it from the oven or skillet, take it off the skewers, and shred it with a knife.
5. Build your shawarma by layering the flatbread with meat juices, salad, shredded chicken, and sauces. For extra flavor, drizzle with tahini sauce or sprinkle sumac. Wrap it up, and for an authentic experience, use paper and tin foil.

1 package yeast

1/2 cup lukewarm water

1 egg beaten, room temperature

1/4 cup sugar

1 tsp salt

1 cup canned evaporated milk, room temperature

3 cups four, sifted

Vegetable oil

Powdered sugar

In a mixing bowl dissolve yeast in lukewarm water. Add egg, sugar, salt, and evaporated milk. Gradually blend in flour, mixing well. Cover bowl with moistened towel and place in refrigerator overnight. Turn dough onto a floured surface and roll out to 1/4-inch thickness. Cut into 2 1/2 –inch squares and allow dough to dry on floured board, 10-12 minutes before frying. Fry in 1 inch very hot vegetable oil, turning once, cooking until golden brown, approximately 3 minutes. With slotted spoon, remove doughnuts and place on a paper towel to drain. Sprinkle liberally with powdered sugar. Dough will keep in refrigerator for several days. Makes about 2-2 ½ dozen.

Serve with cup of café au lait. 
Café au lait is equal parts hot coffee and chicory with scalded milk

from The Plantation Cookbook by the Junior League of New Orleans",

ltsr0ch,t1_ltrkx4r,1gc2awj,Pasta -> ragu -> bechamel -> parm -> repeat,
ltv05w2,t1_ltrkx4r,1gc2awj,"I have a recipe I swear by, adapted from a Theo Randall recipe… I tend to cook by eye so here it is without measurements as such
In a heavy iron bottomed pan, I cook pancetta - dry fry until it’s crispy and the fat has rendered.  Throw in a handful of fennel seeds and a large diced onion, continue to cook until the onion softens and is golden.  At this point, add two carrots and two sticks celery - finely diced.  Cook on a low heat for - few minutes, then add the meat - I use finely diced chuck steak or a combination of minced beef and pork but prefer the former.  When the meat has browned, add a glass of wine - I prefer to use white rather than red… as the wine bubbles away, now add some pureed tomato paste and some passata or sieved tomatoes, a pinch of sugar, some salt and pepper and a splash of milk and/or a handful of grated Parmesan.  Transfer to the oven and cook for 2 hours at 180 degrees.

Assemble lasagne - in a large oven proof dish, layer the ragu sauce with sheets of pasta - again I prefer dried to fresh - add some fresh basil between layers as well as a bechamel or cheese sauce - for this, butter melted in a pan, tablespoon or flour to make a paste… slowly add warmed milk and a bay leaf… stir constantly until the sauce thickens.  Add salt and pepper and a generous dose of grated nutmeg.  I like to add cheese to my sauce - mozzarella or Parmesan is good.  Layer the dish ensuring at least three layers of pasta, top with more sauce, more fresh basil and a good grating or fresh Parmesan.

Bake for 40 minutes in the oven - 30 mins with a foil cover and 10 without to crisp the top.
Hope you enjoy!",

ljen1ha,t1_ljdcoyf,1eyewzv,"What I like about kibbeling is that it's a market food. So you'd buy a portion, eat it standing up at the fish stall and then go about your day. Chips would make it a meal as opposed to a quick snack whilst shopping.",

I don't know where i came up with it, but this is basically what I make, though I add the spices to the batter.",
ljo3lyw,t1_ljmmpcc,1eyewzv,Yup. Traditional British fish and chips from a chippy is a descaled cod fillet. The skin remains - probably because it's quicker. At pubs they usually take the skin off - it's a big improvement.,
ljo6twx,t1_ljo3lyw,1eyewzv,"Huh, never would have thought. I've cought thousands of cod. It seems easier to just filllet and skin them, though i usually only use halibut l, which has a more prominent skin. The only thing I'll bother to scale is snapper when I want the skin for a particular texture, but it's a pain in the ass. I'll only do it if I'm frying the entire fish and want the skin crisped up.

What all do you put in the dip? I'll do a simple tartar, aoli or just tempura sauce.

My fish and chip is a lot different than what's normally made locally. Surprised to see it's so similar to what you have at home and seen as a different meal.

Ignore the chip part, I'm just used to saying it when I fry fish.",
ljoaywf,t1_ljo6twx,1eyewzv,"Traditional Fish and chips doesn't usually come with a dip unless you get a pub version, in which case it's a tartar sauce. Mushy peas are also popular. 

With kibbeling they usually offer a handful of options, usually Ravigote which is a vinaigrette oil/vinegar based sauce with shallot, dill, mustard, capers pickles. There is also Remoulade which is similar to Ravigote but mayo based. Garlic sauce, whiskeysauce and aioli are also common.",
ljq2ohk,t1_ljoaywf,1eyewzv,Hah. I'd never have thought of peas with fried fish and of course they sound like they were named by a dickens chimney sweep.,

lofli0y,t3_1fmlh8j,1fmlh8j,"**Recipe formatted for easier viewing**

**Ingredients**

*Piri piri sauce:*


* 2 red peppers sliced into large pieces

* 2 red onions peeled and chopped into large chunks

* 120 ml (1/2 cup) oil divided, (sunflower oil, vegetable oil or your favourite flavourless oil is fine).

* 1 tsp paprika

* 1 tsp smoked paprika

* 2 tsp cayenne pepper

* 1 ½ tsp salt

* 4 cloves garlic peeled

* 2 red serrano chillies deseeded and sliced in half

* 10 dried African birds eye chillies

* ¼ tsp white pepper

* zest and juice of 1 lemon

* ¼ tsp dried rosemary

* 4 tbsp red wine vinegar

*Chicken:*

* 1 medium chicken (1.4kg-1.6kg or 3 lbs-3.5lbs) *spatchcocked* see below

* ½ tsp black pepper

**Directions**

1. Preheat the oven to 180C/350F (fan).

2. Place the peppers and red onion on a baking tray. Drizzle on 2 tbsp of the vegetable oil. Sprinkle on the paprika, smoked paprika, cayenne pepper, and 1 tsp of the salt and toss together.
2 red peppers,2 red onions,1 tsp paprika,1 tsp smoked paprika,2 tsp cayenne pepper,1 ½ tsp salt

3. Place in the oven for 20 minutes.

4. Add the garlic and serrano chillies and toss together again, then place in the oven for a further 10 minutes. 

5. After 10 minutes, add 4 cloves garlic,2 red serrano chillies

6. Remove from the oven and transfer to a blender (make sure you pour in all the juices from the tray). Add the dried chillies, white pepper, lemon zest and juice, and the dried rosemary. Blend until smooth.

7. Add 10 dried African birds eye chillies,1/4 tsp white pepper,zest and juice of 1 lemon,¼ tsp dried rosemary

8. Add the remaining vegetable oil and the red wine vinegar and blend again.
120 ml (1/2 cup) oil,4 tbsp red wine vinegar

9. Now it's time to spatchcock the chicken. Get one (1) 1 medium chicken (1.4kg-1.6kg or 3 lbs-3.5lbs) Place chicken breast-side down on a sturdy chopping board, with the legs towards you.

10. Using heavy-duty scissors or poultry shears, cut along both sides of the backbone. It's a little fiddly, as you have to cut through each of the rib bones as you go. So it's better to go slowly, rather than trying to cut through multiple ribs at once.

11. Once you've cut through both sides of the backbone, discard the bone (or save it to make stock). Turn the chicken over and press down with both hands on the breastbone to flatten the chicken.

12. Place the spatchcocked chicken on a baking tray and pour over one-third of the sauce. Sprinkle with the remaining ½ tsp salt and the black pepper.
½ tsp black pepper

13. Place in the oven (still at 180C/350F (fan)) for 45 minutes.

14. After 45 minutes, baste the chicken and spoon over 2 more tablespoons of the sauce. Place back in the oven for a further 10-15 minutes until the chicken is cooked through.

15. Remove from the oven and allow to rest for 10 minutes.

16. Serve with the remaining sauce.",

Bacon

The crispy sage was just a sage leaf fried in bacon fat for a few seconds. Sprinkled with salt after cooking.

kk2pla1,t1_kk2p37l,1adjdy7,"That's pretty accurate to properly cooked scallops, maybe slightly underdone. Maybe it's just not for you. 

They're not meant to flake the way fin fish does. That happens because of the way fin fish muscles work. The foot of a scallop (the part we eat) is much more similar to terrestrial meat in its structure.",
kk6p8w3,t1_kk1w4z1,1adjdy7,"About 2 min a side on a nice hot cast iron. However, I think the secret to the sear is to dry them really well, salt and then dry them again.",

# Peri Peri Seasoning Ingredients:

* 3 tbsp Dried Birds Eye Chilli - (Adjust to preferred spice level)
* 2 tbsp Paprika
* 1 tbsp Dried Oregano
* 2 tbsp Ground Coriander
* 1 tbsp Salt
* 1 tsp Black Pepper
* ½ tsp Ground Cardamom
* 1 tsp Granulated Sugar 
* 1 pinch Mace

# Peri Peri Chicken Recipe:

1. Score the chicken and thoroughly coat it with oil and Peri Peri seasoning blend. You can add a ladle of sauce to your marination instead of oil. For the best results, marinate the chicken overnight.
2. Begin by preheating your grill or frying pan to a medium-high setting. When preparing to grill chicken breasts, it's essential to cook them thoroughly until their internal temperature registers at 72°C (162°F). Once you've finished grilling, allow the chicken pieces to rest for at least 5 minutes prior to serving.
3. Serve and savor the robust, spicy taste of your peri peri chicken! For a well-rounded meal, consider pairing it with crispy French fries, a refreshing coleslaw or garden salad, some grilled vegetables, and perhaps a creamy garlic dip or tzatziki sauce. A chilled beverage like iced tea or a sparkling lemonade would complement the spiciness perfectly.

If you remove the fat from the broth, you get a much better end product. You use the fat to fry the tortillas in and the broth you dunk in is a lot less greasy and more flavorful. 

Easiest way to defat is to put the whole container of liquid in the fridge and then scoop out the solid fat, but skimming works.

Based on the meal's visible content, here's an estimated nutrition breakdown:



| Nutrient         | Estimated Amount |

|------------------|------------------|

| Calories         | 900-1200 kcal    |

| Proteins         | 35-50 g          |

| Carbohydrates    | 100-150 g        |

| Fats             | 50-70 g          |



\*Assumptions:\* Standard serving sizes have been considered – a regular fried fish filet, approximately 4 oz; 1 cup of French fries; 1/2 cup of coleslaw; and a lemon wedge and watermelon slice as garnishes. The exact values can significantly vary based on preparation methods and specific ingredients used.



---



### Positive Aspects 🌟



- \*\*Balanced Nutrition:\*\* The meal contains protein from the fish, carbohydrates from the fries, and a small amount of fiber from the watermelon and coleslaw.

- \*\*Flavor Balance:\*\* The fish likely offers savory and crispy tastes, complimented by the creamy and tangy flavor of the coleslaw. The watermelon provides a sweet and refreshing touch.

- \*\*Visual Presentation:\*\* The meal has a colorful appeal with the green of the parsley and red of the watermelon offering a contrast against the golden tones of the fried items.



---



### Improvement Suggestions 💡



- \*\*Nutritional Balance:\*\* To increase fiber and reduce saturated fat, consider grilling the fish instead of frying and serving with a mixed greens salad instead of fries.

- \*\*Ingredient Diversity:\*\* Add a variety of vegetables such as tomatoes, cucumbers, or bell peppers to enhance vitamins and minerals.

- \*\*Sensory Appeal:\*\* Introduce a whole grain or legume side to improve texture variety. Consider adding a sprinkle of fresh herbs like dill or parsley to add fragrance and elevate taste.

- \*\*Health Profile:\*\* Substitute the coleslaw dressing with a lighter yogurt-based option, and opt for baked sweet potato fries to reduce overall calorie and fat intake.



Remember, a balanced meal should ideally provide a rich variety of nutrients while also appealing to the senses with its presentation and taste.

Yorkie is definitely overcooked. Even if you excuse away the browning level by stating it was higher in the oven, those broken edges wouldn't crack like that on a well cooked dish.

The commenter about gravy I was about to get into it with because I only saw the thin gravy on the mash, not the translucent liquid filling the rest of the dish.

And on the topic of gravy, why is it on the mash and none on the peas? Thats a waste of good real estate. Not to mention there is no sign of seasoning anywhere within that white glob of potato. The Brits and Spaniards didn't conquer the seas over a spice trade just for you to use none of them.

Finally, those toads need to come further out their holes, not hidden beneath the fat folds of your brown bready baby.

I noticed in a lot of your posts, people ask for where to find the recipe and you reply with how they can find it. If you want to drive traffic to your site, just reply with the website and even better, a link to the recipe they are asking for!

There’s regional semantic ambiguity in play tho. When you say grits you’re likely thinking hominy grits, which uses nixtamilized corn meal. That’s what Mississippi knows as grits, so you are making a fair point here.",

To be a nitpicky asshole, I personally like a lower angle, but yours works well here too. Nice choice of plate, but I would've rotated the plate to hide the chip. 


As far as the bruised basil, did you chiffonade?
I don't cook with fresh herbs as much as I want to and I heard that rolling leafy herbs tightly before you cut them can help prevent that. Or does the dull knife still result in bruising even if you chiffonade?",

I see your point with the chip, but I don’t mind the chip, these are rustic plates, and I feel like the chip gives a character. But I do understand from a photographic perspective where it may be an eyesore.

m2syx0t,t1_m2sydlk,1hhkv2b,"If you have a very very sharp knife there probably isn't much in it, but chopped basil will generally look a bit sad and bruised when you take a knife to it. 

You're *""supposed""* to tear basil by hand, then it doesn't fray around the edges. Picked basil also looks a bit more rustic and natural this way which suits the types of dishes you use it to garnish with a bit better than more precise cuts.

Tbh though I love basil so will happily toss whole leaves through my pasta and then garnish with a gremolata or something if I wanted a finer chopped garnish for whatever reason.",

Everything is very much “quantobasta”, or enough when it’s enough.

About twice as much beef as pork, plus a couple of rashers of pancetta per person. 

Deglazed with tomato paste, reduced. Deglazed with wine, reduced. Milk, reduced. Stock, reduce. 

I use hardy herbs in mine at the every beginning, that isn’t traditional, to be honest. (Shock horror) but it’s the sort of thing that doesn’t stick out once the sauce has cooked for hours.",

The runniness in question is a very rich emulsion of the reduced sauce, butter, cheese and pasta water, so given a quick toss incorporated again quite nicely.
