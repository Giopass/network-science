It was 1989. I was a freshman, playing college football.  We had won our conference for the first time and as a reward, we were treated to a BBQ by the husband of the team secretary, who just happened to be a professional competitive BBQ chef.  

As we are about ready to start.  The guy comes out of his 20ft long BBQ trailer with the stereotypical hog on a plate with the apple in its mouth.  He sets the hog on the table in front of us.  Then he grabs the ears of the hog and lifts it.  As he does, the meat LITTERALLY falls off the bone and onto the plate.  He then takes the skin and bones in his hands and walks back into to trailer.  I have never seen anything as mouth watering.",

l91fjyx,t3_1df4ut5,1df4ut5,I have tasted British Wagyu but not the Japanese version. It‚Äôs great steak but variable over here. I like the fact though that some farmers are actually looking at quality rather than quantity. Some mention here they don‚Äôt like fatty foods but most of the crap that‚Äôs sold in fast food outlets is full of fat (the wrong kind) I have also heard that some Japanese Wagyu cattle are given beer and massages. That‚Äôs more than I get üòÄ Tesco now so Wagyu beef burgers but they (like most mass produced food) don‚Äôt have the flavour profile I would expect from quality meat. Also kudos to your girlfriend. I need one like that who cares so much‚Ä¶,üòÄ

l8taydf,t3_1df4ut5,1df4ut5,"The number of people here who don't understand Wagyu... It's not the same as the fat you get in non Wagyu beef, it's mostly polyunsaturated, which means it melts when you touch it. 

As a result when eating it, you're not chewing through fat, the fat should melt in your mouth. On top of that, the fat is healthier than other meat, meaning it can be fattier with less health risk.

Further, the fat content will fill you up quicker, so you don't need as much of it. These lumps may look small, but with a few sides it's enough. 

Personally I prefer less fatty, but as an experience, 100% go for it. You should use high heat and ideally cube it. Should brown the outside, but the inside can just be warmed so that the fat starts to melt. Having said that, it's a super forgiving meat as you can't really dry it out.

My wife and I used to buy thick 600g bone in ribeyes to share, these days we're moving to smaller amounts of high quality Wagyu. Similar price, nicer meat, still fills you up, healthier, and less environmental impact.

I import wagyu from japan and Australia. There's just such a huge difference in bms6-9 vs 12. For example 8 and 12 are both A5 but at the highest levels your getting 90%+ fat content. It's going to taste identical to cutting off some picanha fat with 10% meat hanging on.

That shows you do not have a complex enough of a palette to differentiate the difference in taste. It will not taste identical to picanha fat with 10% meat hanging off.

It isnt merely just the ratio of fat to meat. Nor the fat content. But rather the composition of the fat. To put it into simpler terms. It taste different than other fat. The wagyu from Australia and USA is cross bred. Even if it achieves the same level of Marbling it won‚Äôt taste the same. Like previously noted, pure bred wagyu cattle is very high in unsaturated fats. This is what changes the mouthfeel and taste.

https://wagyushop.com/blogs/news/is-wagyu-beef-healthier

‚ÄúWagyu beef is extremely rich in monounsaturated fatty acids and contains all of the essential amino acids, including omega-3 and omega-6 fatty acids. Essential fatty acids such as these are believed to lower risk of cardiovascular disease, cancer, Alzheimer's and other conditions. The richly marbled beef also contains more conjugated linoleic acid (CLA), which is believed to have health benefits such as lowered risk of disease and diabetes.

The fatty acid profile of your beef isn't just necessary for your health, it's also necessary for flavor. These acids, especially oleic acid that's abundant in Wagyu, contribute to its signature buttery, umami flavor.‚Äù

This is not an attack on ‚Äúwesterners‚Äù or an assumption that you lack knowledge or intelligence. You could very well be an expert on western cuts of beef and their composition. I only mean to share this info because true Japanese Wagyu gets misunderstood.",

There are both true things and completely innocent to say about wagyu and meat in general if the commenter here was gonna somehow ruin OP's day. He posted a screenshot from a hilarious show.

I hope OP enjoyed their dinner. Honestly they probably could have split each of those with their girlfriend on two separate meals and enjoyed them a ton as a highlight to a meal with nicely prepared veggies and a properly dense protein, like one might enjoy in many authentic Asian restaurants. Flavors could be ""American"" or whatever. You don't need much wagyu to enjoy it, which is why it makes sense to have hilariously small portions. It ain't an insult that they're tiny ""steaks"". They're not meant to be eaten as steaks. They're often meant to be cut even tinier and cooked as thin slices. 

I wouldn't be sad about the fact that I had so little. I'd be sad if I had too much and couldn't enjoy it. It's tiny, it's funny, and it's perfect that way. No feelings need be hurt.

Its fine to be vegan. It's not fine to lie and attempt to rewrite our history as if there is any biological justification for your bullshit. We were supposed to eat meat, because we can.

Our brains were only able to evolve to be so large because we ate meat. If you had your way our brains would be the size of an apes.

If you‚Äôre going to continue the diet, drastically limit the bacon. Bacon is one of the least healthy foods available. Delicious and wonderful in moderation, but so bad for you.

Throw in some garlic, maybe some chinese chives if you can find then use something called Chinese Five Spice. You can get that in the Asian section at Wal-mart. You don't want to use a lot at all, I use a couple teaspoons. 

Use that to marinade your chicken. Even just an hour or two in marinade helps but if you can, marinade for 24 hours. 

And the final step, cooking! Times and heats can vary but for chicken I usually pan fry it or throw it in the oven at like 350 degrees F for 15-20 minutes or maybe longer if you have big cuts of chicken.

lphrswy,t1_lpholjd,1frs8ge,"It‚Äôs a great question. And the answer is, it takes nitrates to make them not go bad. Yeah, that chemical everyone says causes cancer. There‚Äôs mentions of saltpeter (potassium nitrate) as early as 300BC. People have been putting nitrates in their cured sausages for millennia. Botulism is an aerobic process, so for whole meats it‚Äôs possible to use just salt (like jam√≥n ib√©rico, which only uses salt) because there‚Äôs no air introduced into the meat, but grinding meat and stuffing it into casings by default introduces air into the meat, so it‚Äôs nearly (if not) impossible to created shelf-stable cured sausages without the use of nitrates.

[Here‚Äôs an article you might find interesting.](https://carnivoreclub.co/blogs/the-daily-meat/history-of-meat-curing) The ‚Äúreddening‚Äù it refers to? That‚Äôs why hams, pastrami, and the turkey legs you get at the fair are red, when their non-treated equivalents are not.

Another fun anecdote: there‚Äôs a sausage one can get in Munich called weisswurst that is traditionally only eaten for breakfast. The story goes that a popular restaurant ran out of their typical sausages during breakfast, so the chef made up a new sausage recipe from scratch on the fly, and the new sausages he made that morning were made in such a way that they would spoil by the afternoon, since refrigeration wasn‚Äôt invented at that time. Now, of course, with refrigeration, one could easily eat weisswurst for dinner, but because of how the sausage started, not many Bavarians do.",

Abstract¬† Among food allergens, crustaceans, such as shrimp, crab, crawfish and lobster, are a frequent cause of adverse food reactions in allergic individuals. The major allergen has been identified as the muscle protein tropomyosin. This molecule belongs to a family of highly conserved proteins with multiple isoforms found in both muscle and nonmuscle cells of all species of vertebrates and invertebrates. Its native structure consists of two parallel alpha-helical tropomyosin molecules that are wound around each other forming a coiled-coil dimer. Allergenic tropomyosins are found in invertebrates such as crustaceans (shrimp, lobster, crab, crawfish), arachnids (house dust mites), insects (cockroaches), and mollusks (e.g. squid), whereas vertebrate tropomyosins are nonallergenic.¬† ¬†

Reverse sear in 215¬∞ oven to internal 108¬∞, straight to ripping castiron in avocado oil, then unsalted butter till preferred crust. So tender didn't need a knife.

You got ripped off. They saw someone willing to buy the Brooklyn Bridge, and your mom bought. Hopefully, she isn't as gullible with other things (i.e., money scams). Buying good meat is different from cooking meat. Two different types of knowledge that do share some overlap. Knowing what you want to cook determines what meat to buy. I wouldn't use ribeye in stew or rump as steak, although I'm sure there are ways to use them as such.

Buying can confuse people when labels like ""choice, prime, angus, and waygu,"" just to toss some terms, are used. Angus, for example, is a breed of cattle, while ""prime, choice, standard, and utility"" is used to grade the cow as a whole and not the individual cuts. Big stores will also label meat with these same/similar terms, like ""XYZ's PREMIER CUT choice beef"" or ""ZYX's SUPERIOR CUT standard beef."" This is to fool you to think their meat is the best. 

This being said, a prime grade cow can produce a glorious tenderloin or rump, while the rest is just choice; yet it ALL gets labeled as prime. Or, a cow can be labeled as choice while having glorious ribeyes and strips.

This is when knowing what you want to make and how you're going to make it come into play. A good marbled ribeye that has a fat center, I'll throw in a pan vs grill due to it wanting to fall apart as the fat is rendered and keeping the fat in the pan and not flairing up the grill/oiling charcoal.

All this, I think I'm just a beginner in all the knowledge of meat/steak/cooking/smoking, but if my knowledge can help others, I will share it. If I'm wrong and/or missed something without it going more in-depth, comment and let me know.",

The fat at the end is down to preference. You can ask a butcher to trim it. The fat itself weighs much less than the lean muscle. That is why if you ever buy actual wagyu, something that looks like 12oz is going to surprise you when the scale says 8oz.

American Wagyu tastes great. There is nothing wrong with it and your issue has more to do with the merchant. If you don't see anything substantially better next time, I would recommend looking for a well marbled grass fed or dry aged NY strip which should come in around $25-35/lb.",

But one steak with contamination will be spread to all other steaks tenderized in the same batch.  Which still is fine if you cook to 160 Deg.

m1qkucq,t1_m1qhttt,1hc4ufu,Kinda. Wagyu is a breed of cattle from Japan so it can be sold as Wagyua regardless of the A5 certification. You can grow Wagyu cattle in the US or Japan for that matter and sell it as Wagyu without the strict a5 certificate which is what I imagine is what's happening. I'm not sure most consumers know the difference and sure it's shitty but it's not false advertising as you are claiming. Having an amazing cut of meet that is wagyu without the a5 certificate is still wagyu. My guess is you have a mix of false advertisement especially in smaller shops AND you have authentic wagyu but its just the cattle and not related to the specific raising process for a5.

I'm not saying EVOO isn't also used, but tallow and butter are used plenty as well. That's my point, it's far more common than you think",

Our version here in romania also includes lots of other spices (thyme, all spice, coriander, cumin, star anaise, sodium bicarbonate, lemon juice) plus beef bones stock, with the bone marrow still on, and reduced, and no paprika, as you said you guys use.

And we eat it with mustard, not zacusca (our similar product to ajvar) or heavy sour cream (closest we probably have to kajmak). Also, ayran is not a thing here... But we must have beer instead üòõ plus bread and/or french fries. Maybe even pickled veggies / gurkins, but that's not the most common.

sure, you can season it up just like anything. but it's like makeup on a plain girl vs makeup on a naturally beautiful girl",
ladicpe,t1_ladgwo3,1dordmg,"If it's a good steak I'll cook it with a little salt and nothing else. 

Salt alone won't help the mass produced chicken breasts.",

So for fries, I soaked them in ice water for a few hours to help remove some of the starch. Then I put them in the oven (at 190) to dry out. Heat oil up to about 350¬∞ then fry about 6 minutes. (You can also double fry them). 

For the steak, I prefer reverse searing. So I got the internal temp to 110¬∞ and let rest. I used a sous vide for this cook. So once it was done I dried the steak. 

Then using a cast iron (or nice stainless steel pan) you want to get that sucker hot. Like really hot. To where water dances on the surface. Then take a high smoke point oil (I used grapeseed oil) and get that oil hot. Place the steak, and let it sit. I did about a 1 minute per side. 

Lower the heat and add a knob of butter and some aromatics. The baste that sucker for about another minute. 

Then let rest!",

lyhcg43,t1_lyh5fok,1gxf1re,When i tried making wellingtons i read best was to flash fry them hot fire short time. But it had a lot of moisture left over so i would let it drain in a colander before wrapping.

lyhfr2r,t1_lyheahr,1gxf1re,Another thing i learned from experimenting is I didn‚Äôt feel the prosciutto added anything significant. Cutting it was difficult to cut cleanly with steak knife and get it all in one bite. And the flavors did not combine to make it awesome they felt more like they conflicted. What I ended up doing was cooking bacon in a tray for like 20 minutes let it cook in the fat that comes out. It should come out ultra crispy and you crumble the shit out of it with your hands making coarse bacon bits. Use that between pastry and duxelle layer it hits hard and you don‚Äôt need much because of the texture difference. And the fat helped with flavor because fillet is quite lean.,

Rancid lamb is one of the most unpleasant smells imaginable, it will make you swear off food in general for days until the stench dissipates.

Like I said though, mileage may vary, but I'd always be sure to cook it same day or the next. 

That said, I too have gotten some awesome cuts from them, so I guess it depends on the location moreso than the company. Won't be buying anymore meat from them by me, but the location back in my parents town has never let me down",

It definitely has more of a distinct taste but it's no where near as gamey as a deer or elk to my taste buds. I actually like that more wild taste because I was raised to enjoy moose meat because my family hunted meat (we still do). But to someone used to store bought beef it may be a bit of an adjustment, if you've ate wild game before lamb is a delicious in between and shouldn't be a shock.",

m2wmwp8,t1_m2wkgnt,1hi5ita,Gamey taste is concentrated in the fat. I never really experienced much gameyness from lamb chops other than the exterior fat cap which I trim off,
m2wmea4,t1_m2wkgnt,1hi5ita,"The costco lamb chops are pretty good not too gamey one time I made them a guy described it as ""a steak on a stick""",

Like brining the meat in milk (water and salt would also be ok but not as good), plenty of spices during the cook and when you serve it you need to put some citron or lime or vinegar on it. Another quite common trick is to grill it and serve it really hot, no resting or the like, that somehow dampens the strong flavour.

I looked it up and found a post on reddit from some New Zealanders talking about how rank vacuum sealed lamb in particular is. So, I let it sit in the fridge for like an hour to air out.

And yep, it was fine after that, it just smelled a little gamey like lamb does. I cooked it and it was delicious. And no one got sick or anything.",
m2yf1vp,t1_m2yd476,1hi5ita,"Vacuum sealed meats just smell bad when opened. I try to avoid them for a fresher cut in regular wrap and foam tray products because of this.

m30qibp,t1_m3097gu,1hi5ita,"A huge amount of the gaminess that comes with lamb in particular is from the fat. It's true for a lot of gamey meat.

I‚Äôm also a biology teacher who‚Äôs dissected quite a number of rabbits (cats are harder to come by lately‚Ä¶.not necessarily a bad thing‚Ä¶and rabbits are the most reasonable alternative). 

The diameter of what used to be the tail looks too big for rabbit but correct for squirrel. And the neck size looks slightly too big for rabbit. These are small difference, for sure. 

I‚Äôve butchered and eaten squirrel also, but not dissected them. 

Lastly, the scale of the animal on the grill looks to be more squirrel sized than rabbit.

However bear muscle also has a compound in it that breaks down at just a few degrees above what is required to kill the parasite. When this compound breaks down it becomes very bitter. You have to get bear meat to the exact temperature needed and absolutely do not overcook it.

Sous vide would be the way to go.

With my wild game, I know what is was eating, where it was living, when it died, how quickly it was before the meat was broken down and cooked off, the time before it got cleaned up, broken down more, and frozen.

I live in wa state where black bear numbers seem to be as high as pre European settler numbers were so I don‚Äôt have a leg to stand on for being offended by it logically- and hunting your own meat is much more ethical than what I do anyway. It always seemed like an extension of killing an elephant or rhino or lion to me- just killing a powerful and beautiful creature for how it makes you feel. I‚Äôm grateful to you for teaching me something.,
lrtnx2d,t1_lrsyg5z,1g2svqb,"With our wild animals living so close to humans, how can you trust what it eats over factory meat?  I know chickens (if not organic) are fed other dead, diseased chickens.  Same with cows. Also, part of their diet is their own feces. So I‚Äôm definitely not saying factory farming is great, and trustworthy. 

But bears are drinking from puddles and waterways with anti-freeze and all sorts of other nasties in them. As their territory dwindles, bear increasingly and literally eat trash, sometimes. 

That sludge of battery acid water, maggot eggs, and run-off from human bio-hazards from bathroom bins all the way to rotten and likely parasite-addled old foods, they are slurping that up as they chomp away at the trash and plastic.  

And hunters who use feeders spread diseases to and from animals that normally would never cross-contaminate each other. So now you have a variety of species and dozens of animals all visiting that same batch of corn and water and salt.  And a bear isn‚Äôt going straight into a freezer. Like any large animal, it is sitting open to flies and heat and crawling insects, as it is skinned. 

Or if you‚Äôre hauling it, it‚Äôs rotting by the hour. I‚Äôve had ‚Äúgame‚Äù meats that have a rainbow of colors show as it‚Äôs cooking, from God-knows-what it was exposed to, after the after animal died.

Eating horse meat has been widespread since prehistory, including in North America. It was also popular in Britain until Christianisation of the Anglo-Saxons, at which point it became associated with heathen Norse raiders and became a taboo. It was such a strong tie that even now, people would be largely unwilling to try. They won't really know why, the cultural aversion has just lingered.

When cooking a rack of ribs, you want it limited to the actual bone section of the ribs. Well above the ribs (or below if you're looking at the pig) is a section of meat filled with cartilage, little bones (the chine bone), and connective tissue. You can identify this area with one basic rule: bones don't bend. If you try to fold the ribs in half lengthwise like a tall book, you will get a good idea where these sections meet. You can also find it by looking for a long line of fat that runs lengthwise along the rack. This doesn't always help because you can't always find it.

The biggest problem with this step is that the point of separation between these sections is not a straight line, but if you stick to the rule (bones don't bend), you will have no trouble locating and cutting away this rib tip section. Now, you have a rack of just ribs.

I don't typically find racks with big enough flaps to be worth keeping attached.

chine
noun [ C ]   FOOD & DRINK   specialized
US  /t Éa…™n/ UK  /t Éa…™n/
Add to word list 
(also chine bone)
the backbone, especially of an animal:
Take out the chine and leave in the sparerib.
To carve the joint, cut away the chine bone and discard.
 
a cut of meat that includes part of the backbone:
They loved the county's pork products, such as stuffed chine, chitterlings, and tripe.
 Fewer examples
If your butcher hasn't already, cut the racks into chops, using a cleaver if necessary to separate the chine bone.
Ask your butcher to cut through the chine bone so it is easy to carve.",

I don't know if you're not familiar with pork,  but this is normal.  Hell, watch an episode of BBQ Pitmasters where they have full spares and you'll see the cooks trimming this off and some even talking about it.

The spare rib is attached to the belly, not the spine, the back ribs are surprisingly enough attached to the spine.

And I wouldn't really call BBQer's experts in the nomenclature of hog parts, in preparation sure, but unless they came from a butchering background, they are getting their terms from either second hand knowledge or what they heard off of the internet as well.

Even saying ""the roasts they had were *only* 6 pounds"" vs. ""they *only* had 6 pound roasts"" would have made it more clear. 

The point still stands that the store probably noticed they sell more 6 pound roasts than larger sizes and it was easier to precut them to that size during a time of higher demand than it is to offer custom cuts. You're really not losing much by cooking two 6 pound roasts vs. a 12 pound roast.",

There's a good reason why different types of food have a HUGE difference when it comes to preservativon time by cold (freezing). The process of ""decay"" doesn't stop at -18‚Å∞C, if that was the case, then meat would last ""forever"" after being frozen. And taking out the oxigen of the food, does NOT stop from anaerobic microorganisms to keep growing in number.

The cutlery holder in the dishwasher at my house fills up so quickly, and we have an excessive number of small dessert sized spoons for tasting. Pretty sure I've got a full set of 12 for cutlery, but then purchased an additional 18 or 24 dessert spoons, because between mixing stuff and using multiple spoons to taste stuff while cooking, we fly through them.

That means the meat from any slaughtered animal is rotten unless the animal was frozen at the time of slaughter.

Burgers were cooked to hockey pucks and every now and then would get a slice of processed cheese on it then they went in two slices of store brand white bread with ketchup and mustard. 

Chicken at least got shake and bake before it got cooked to the shit lords.

Put in the oven at 500 degrees F for thirty minutes then lowered the temp to 225 degrees F for about four hours. Goal internal temp was 135 and I ended up pulling at 137 due to getting caught up with some errands.

l8qwrhs,t1_l8oliy8,1dfsnqf,That's basically how I do ribs and they always come out good,
l8mg897,t1_l8mez8o,1dfsnqf,Laughed way too hard at this.  Great recipe though and will try.,
l8op7sb,t1_l8ny9wr,1dfsnqf,"Well, I guess you just take too long, buddy.",
l8mnf4x,t1_l8mm4zk,1dfsnqf,reducing the wrap time is a good call to keep the meat on the bones - good call üëç,üëç
l8m3hss,t1_l8m1upe,1dfsnqf,"Yes. Bones up wrapped tight in foil for 2 hours after that. Then, unwrap them and sauce them, and put them bones down back in the oven for an hour. All 225 degrees. üéØ",üéØ
l96dgeh,t1_l90dy51,1dfsnqf,"Lol... This is great. Also, solid instructions but i also marinated a bit in liquid smoke before cooking. Now I have a smoker so that's not necessary anymore.",
lbwbgn1,t1_lbw1ead,1dfsnqf,I forgot the most important part‚Ä¶,
l8nv8ay,t1_l8nhmkl,1dfsnqf,"Dunno about Tyson, they might remove it but I kind of doubt it because that's just a lot of extra labor.

You should be able to tell once they're cooked (if you cooked them low and slow to be tender). If all the meat comes straight off the bone, there was no membrane. If it only comes off from one direction/there's a chewy section that you have to gnaw the meat off of, they had a membrane that wasn't removed.",
l8odnp9,t1_l8nhmkl,1dfsnqf,"It's there, it takes some effort to get it off.
You tube some videos I'm sure there are tricks to it.
I use a small narrow knife to get under the first rib and then  I can pull the whole thing off.",

l8liiae,t1_l8lia16,1dfsnqf,"It‚Äôs good if your sauce is more on the savory side, creates a nice offset of savory and sweet",
l8lnstp,t1_l8lni90,1dfsnqf,I also drink a few cans while I eat the ribs,
l8ndq0x,t1_l8n5yni,1dfsnqf,Easiest is probably get them going in the oven and then transfer to your grill.,
l8n8j9i,t1_l8mb2qn,1dfsnqf,Awesome! Thanks for the confidence boost.,
l8qifgf,t1_l8qg3cb,1dfsnqf,My mom used to par boil them too. I make them just like this in the oven now and my dad won‚Äôt eat hers anymore. This recipe is simple and great. Keep it easy and you‚Äôll never be disappointed.,
l8qiqls,t1_l8qg3cb,1dfsnqf,Idk it's a really weird like midwestern northern thing. I can't really explain as I've only had it once from a family visiting from up north. But it's like they didn't have an oven or grill and rolled with that same recipe for generations. This recipe is kinda a classic one. Still wouldn't consider it bbq but it still can be good.,
l8ql29h,t1_l8qg3cb,1dfsnqf,"I think it was just a time-thing. She and my dad both worked so she‚Äôd get back from work and had only enough time to boil them and finish under the broiler before my dad got home. Back then, I didn‚Äôt even know there was abetter way lol.  I grew up assuming I just didn‚Äôt like ribs. Turns out, they‚Äôre one of my favourites when made correctly.",
l93vpcn,t1_l8qg3cb,1dfsnqf,"Boiling before broiling has been done for a long time, even in higher end places. Not saying I fully agree with it, but it actually comes out shockingly well - and its hard to fuck up.",
l8lha6x,t1_l8ldsv6,1dfsnqf,I would remove the membrane. Turn that one burner on and try to get the grill to hold at around 250-275. Probably need to rotate the ribs throughout the cooking process so that no 1 rack is getting too much direct flame. After about 4-5hours they should be nice and tender and ready to sauce and caramelize. Before I had a smoker this is how I would do them.,
l8rwpce,t1_l8rj7ez,1dfsnqf,It‚Äôs that easy.,
l8lh9ri,t1_l8lfmab,1dfsnqf,I'm naive..why the plastic wrap? Won't it just melt right up in the oven?,
l8lhhrp,t1_l8lfmab,1dfsnqf,Also how thick of pans are you using? Just the short 1 inchers?,
l8li7ij,t1_l8lh73q,1dfsnqf,So rub them and let them sit for a few hours before going in the oven?,
l8tjj7p,t1_l8lyakl,1dfsnqf,"Seriously‚Ä¶there must be some poll you could borrow crockpots from!!
40 years I‚Äôve been doing ribs in the crock pot.
Have to watch because the meat will LITERALLY FALL OFF THE BONE!

Quick broil them at the end..
either sauced up 
or a sprinkle (very light) of your rub ‚Ä¶
sauce on the side‚Ä¶

Oh ‚Ä¶btw..
When I pull them from the crockpot‚Ä¶THAT is when I remove the ‚Äúsinew‚Äù from the ‚Äúconcave‚Äù side of the ribs.
It will be very easy especially if you ‚Äúscored‚Äù them beforehand

l8m5fkb,t1_l8m571h,1dfsnqf,"I picked this up from mad scientist BBQ, and it's how I always do my ribs now. You will not have any chewy crunchy membrane on the ribs when you eat them.",

l93jghm,t1_l90bxfr,1dfsnqf,If you know how good a milk steak boiled over hard is then you know boiling ribs is the way to go.,
l8m1i7s,t1_l8lywvx,1dfsnqf,you really don‚Äòt need 5hrs to make good ribs my man,
l8nl3z0,t1_l8ldwen,1dfsnqf,Well I guess I'm more of a planner.  I'm not the one asking strangers for advice on cooking ribs the day of an event.,
l8q6wuk,t1_l8pnm37,1dfsnqf,He could get some smoke on a grill.,
l8pr9gq,t1_l8pnm37,1dfsnqf,That's true. I'd have to say time for a smoker then.,
l8lfhjp,t1_l8le2l0,1dfsnqf,That might be too high of a temperature/time for ribs.,
l8lj1o4,t1_l8le2l0,1dfsnqf,Yeah can pull the bone out clean.,
l8mtfqg,t1_l8mnf4x,1dfsnqf,I also feel like I‚Äôve seen some people saying to do the initial 3 hour cook at the higher 225 temp. This may be where some of the overcooking occirs,
l8m3n45,t1_l8m3hss,1dfsnqf,Any specific temp you like to pull them out at?,
l8lnuro,t1_l8lnstp,1dfsnqf,I‚Äôm sorry to hear that.,

l947na7,t1_l93vpcn,1dfsnqf,I‚Äôve heard of poaching first in high end restaurants but never boiling,
l8lj4fa,t1_l8lha6x,1dfsnqf,"I would so try this, but my grill is insane and likes to shoot up to 500 degrees and stay there. I'm actually getting a new grill and smoker this weekend. So this is kind of my last hurah with old faithful lol. 

I'll probably do the oven for a few hours then glaze em on the grill for a few.",
l8lmypg,t1_l8lhhrp,1dfsnqf,"You can, just make sure the bottom has plenty of liquid. We used to do them like this at a restaurant I managed. Now that I think about it, it might of been 4 hours @225",
l8lj5em,t1_l8li7ij,1dfsnqf,"Yes, if you‚Äôve got the time, try to give them a few hours in the rub, I usually go overnight.  Like he said, 4-5 hours at low will be fall of the bone, if you want a bit more chew, go closer to 3-4 hours.",
l8m33l0,t1_l8m1i7s,1dfsnqf,"Roasting them for 2 hours at 400F and then putting sauce on them for 10 minutes does NOT produce tender ribs.

While I greatly prefer dry ribs cooked low and slow.  You're going to have to put the sauce on before you roast them (wet ribs) if you have any hope of them getting tender in 2 hours.",
l8mncqm,t1_l8m1i7s,1dfsnqf,How does 2 hours turn into 5?,
l8pt0zj,t1_l8nl3z0,1dfsnqf,Get over yourself,
l8qgob2,t1_l8pr9gq,1dfsnqf,"Agreed. 321 is my favorite way, doing 3 baby backs right now. 

Mustard base, then a good dry rub with plenty of salt, brown sugar, pepper, cayenne, etc.",
l8m6750,t1_l8m3n45,1dfsnqf,190¬∞~200¬∞F is a good range for pork ribs.,
l8lny0k,t1_l8lnuro,1dfsnqf,Why are you sorry for that?,
l8rvdm8,t1_l8qjnjx,1dfsnqf,I mean if it works it works. I can't really knock on it,
l8q2vq2,t1_l8mncqm,1dfsnqf,because the poster I replied to stated that those 2 hours are not enough to make good ribs and therefore I deduce that they think that the 3-2-1=5 method is the bare minimum to make good ribs,
l8r4wb3,t1_l8pt0zj,1dfsnqf,Why am I supposed to get over myself?  If you want to do it right don't start looking for advice right before you do the job.  I don't see any problem with that,
l8m6cl3,t1_l8m6750,1dfsnqf,"Perfect. That's what I usually pull them at. Still a little pull but very easy to remove from the bone. Thank you for your help, friend.",

Letting steak sit after being cut also allows oxygen to bind to myoglobin in the meat, causing it to get redder/pinker. A medium well steak can look mid-rare or even fully rare red.

Anytime I have a cut of meat that I know will have fat running through the meaty substrate of the cut, I prefer to give it a quick round in the pan first. It also helps big time with presentation of fatty meat.

It‚Äôs a little bit more work, sure; but I think it‚Äôs worth it‚Ä¶ also, pan searing give you a nice fond to do all sorts of fun stuff with. You could go the nine and make a nice sauce or you can use it to cook some veggies in. Sometimes people bash on serving carrots cooked in the pan but it‚Äôs a classic because it works so well.

Start with low heat for a longer period of time- rest- then blazing hot heat for a short sprint. You'll get the tender medium rare center with rendered fat and max flavor...but then you'll also get the crispy and salty outer bark with minimal greying.

I don't like to use the words medium and medium rare (etc) for prime rib, because those terms have more to do with how high-heat grilled (or seared) steak is prepped. The reason I like medium rare porterhouse, isn't because I like that medium rare inside bit, but that overall (grilled edge to grilled edge) it produces the flavor and texture I am looking for in that bite.

Prime rib is slowly risen to temperature (with a sear before or after the longer low-heat oven bake), its a totally different profile in it's bite, and it has a lot of 'contact' time with the temperature as its risen. The trick, is to get it off while everything is warmed throughout, but not denatured to brown (by that point - it's dry and looses tons of flavor). There is only 'right' and 'wrong' with prime rib (and you don't like prime rib the right way- - that is fine- don't eat it, get a different cut of meat suitable for what you want).

I also am not concerned if you monitored the internal temp (it looks like you did). The intramuscular fat (marbling) doesn't look like it softened. If you only took it to 125ish with resting, you may have missed the best part a medium rare. Animal fat softens between 90 and 130. Just like everything else, it can vary wildy. You may have only missed by 1 degree. The best way to tell is by touch.

Edit: I wrote the one word answer before reading anything other than the title. At my restaurant I could get away with passing this off as either.... While I'd eat the heck out of this, I'd personally ask exactly how you prepared and cooked this cow. 

I ask that because a while back my restaurant started doing prime rib as an occasional special and I had never cooked one in a conventional oven before. Always convection or alto-sham. 

The best I've found so far is drying the loin, then rubbing with some beef base and seasoning it using the beef base to make The seasoning stick.  I place the loins on a rack and let them rest overnight with the dry rub on it, then cook on a rack over a sheet pan in a preheated 550F oven until about 105 internal (for restaurant service), then finish to temp in heated au jus. If you're just slicing and serving straight off the loin immediately then I'd go closer to 115-120 before removing from the oven.",

I‚Äôm guessing they let the roast go at 200-225 too long, probably pulled it at 125-130, which continued cooking from residual heat taking the internal temp up to 135-140, which then negated any opportunity to place the roast back into the 500+ degree oven which would have developed the crust.",

m97ogte,t1_m97juzl,1i9pc8v,It‚Äôs the other way around. It appears more pink and juicy but it‚Äôs because it‚Äôs from an inside cut of a roast there is no sear on it.,

This method gives you a consistent cook throughout, I‚Äôm guessing this specific thin cut steak was near one of the ends or it was a smaller roast and hit an internal of 120-125 prior to resting, even the center most portion of the roast was just slightly less cooked than this one.",

You need to make a cheffy friend who will help you taste the difference. All of our meats are cooked to a different temperature, intended to bring out the best flavor they can. Many of us just agree with the French in that beef tastes better when it isnt cooked until it dries out. Many of us also agree with Japan in that some raw fish tastes even better than the same fish when cooked. Like white tuna- if you cook that, you've ruined its complex flavor profile. 

Other side. Most of us are scared of blush pork because we've been raised that undercooked white meat is dangerous... When the fact is that undercooked *poultry* is dangerous. There is a difference.

I get some people can‚Äôt eat any meat thats not practically burnt. But if thats the case I highly recommend not wasting your money at a top dollar steakhouse‚Ä¶ a $250 steak is going to practically taste the same as an Outback Steakhouse cut if you are cooking all the marbling out of it.

m98qicd,t1_m98oyqf,1i9pc8v,"So yes, this does have some red in the middle. (Red liquid from steaks/ meat in general is not blood unless you just killed the animal. What we have here is myoglobin or hemoglobin or some other protein or whatever.... I just know it isn't blood.) But it really isn't enough to call it midrare (because it's so small). 

 Something important to understand is that temp ranges are quite small. All the following temperatures are in Fahrenheit, because I'm a filthy American. Rare is 115 to 125, midrare is 125 to 135, medium is 135 to 145, midwell is 145 to 155, and well is 155+. Ten degrees Fahrenheit is not a lot. So, when I look at this piece of meat, I ask myself, what temp is this closest to? I'm willing to bet the highest temp reached by the ""coldest"" piece of this meat is around 140 degrees. Hence, it's a medium. Basically, if I only have these discrete buckets to choose from (Rare, midrare, medium, etc...) what bucket do I think thid meat best fits  in. That little bit of red in the center is certainly a quality of midrare, but theres really very little red. The main thing I see is a ton of pink meat. That's medium, buddy. Like, assuming there were an objectively correct answer as to what temp this meat is, and you held a gun to my head, I see much more evidence of a medium here.

Hope that helps. Appreciate your politeness. I freely admit I'm not the keeper of truth. I did spend 20 years cooking professionally, doing everything from dishwasher all the way up to sous. That experience doesn't have innate value. I'm telling you so you can make your own judgments about what my take is worth.

Cooking method and cooking time also directly correlate to what most people would consider doneness. A sous vide steak that's removed as soon as internal temps reach 130 is not done enough to be considered medium-rare by most people (even though color and juiciness would point to med-rare too). But a steak with the same internal temp that's been sous vide cooking for 8 hours would also not qualify as medium-rare for most people, as it'd be shredding. Similarly, too low of a cooking temp won't effectively render fat, leaving the impression of the steak being underdone even when the internal temp, color and juiciness would indicate otherwise.¬†

Edit: the reason this sprang to mind is my last prime rib was sous vide cooked at 130. Looked like a perfect med-rare, was super juicy and very tender, but the fat never rendered at 130 which gave the clear impression of underdone prime rib. Needs to be around 137 to render (at least that's what reddit tells me).",

m9jkapg,t1_m9jjnnf,1i9pc8v,I agree. Was shocked to see how many people claimed this is raw. This is how medium rare looks at a diner that's playing it safe and serving closer to medium. Prime rib stays pretty pink until you overcook it.,

As for portion, the great thing with prime rib is that you can always ask for more slices. If one slice isn't enough, ask for two! Heck, ask for four slices if that floats your boat!

1. Doneness is based on the internal temperature and how cooked the center of the meat is. These percentages you give of how much pink there is is utterly irrelevant because of how a prime rib is cooked, and then sliced into a cross-section AFTER cooking

2. Medium is pink. An extremely surface level of cooking for starters, and can also be confirmed with a basic google search in about 12 seconds

3. Blue rare is raw with only a sear. Which this is not borderline from. If this were anywhere near raw it‚Äôs be red. Not pink

The steak has firmed to the point where the definition of the striations is clearly visible. The meat is a flat pink with no sign of red anywhere. This steak is medium, on the edge of medium rare.

You can tell it was quite well cooked because of how deep the brown edge is around the steak

You also said (this is the dumbest thing you said): ‚ÄúSecondly, this is absolutely rare, verging on blue rare‚Äù

Medium rare is- is red center, slightly warm and grows pink as you move to the exterior.

Blue rare- is red throughout, the exteriors have been seared at a high temperature(to kill any bacteria), but center remains uncooked and cool to the touch.

So it‚Äôs not ‚Äúverging on blue rare‚Äù, because it‚Äôs not even verging on medium rare.

I wrote all this out because you are so wrong about multiple things, but you‚Äôre clearly an arrogant person who‚Äôd rather call names or deflect rather than admit you‚Äôre wrong and completely out of your element.",

m97yppx,t1_m97uac8,1i9pc8v,"Ive only cooked prime rib now twice. But ive cooked plenty of ribeyes to smoked briskets for 14hrs etc etc. 

Im no expert but im a meat enjoyer for sure. Imo i dont measure the meat by the coldest area but by it as a whole. For a prime rib id call this medium as a whole. If we are going by sections, the cap is well, just under the cap is medium and center-to-bottom is medium rare-ish.... You dont look at a prime rib the same as you do a steak your 100% right on that. Your also most likely right on the temperature being too high for at least some of the cook. My best guess is it was in a pan and not above the pan. Exposing the cap to more heat than the rest of the meat. When cooking a big piece of meat like this you want it exposed to an even amount of heat for the entirety of the cook. Placing it into a pan is like putting a heat shield around some of the meat. Placing it on a rack above the sides of your drip pan is the way. Nice even heat surrounding the meat. 

Answer - No in a perfect world a medium rare would be medium rare from side to side no change in color. No gradient of pink to gray. A nice crust and consistent amount of doneness. Imo bleeding can happen at many variations of doneness but having a good crust and letting the meat rest for 10ish minutes helps with having less bleed. No matter the amount of cook.",

This is neither of those things. 

You saying it‚Äôs raw, doesn‚Äôt make it raw. It has reached a certain temperature, to make it impossible to be considered raw. That isn‚Äôt up for discussion. Every meat thermometer, FDA guideline, and recipe book has those numbers defined. 

This is pink, with semi translucent fat. If it was raw, it would be red and white. There is no ‚Äúopinion‚Äù that will change that. 

It‚Äôs prime rib. If you order med/med-rare, this is how it will come out to you. You claiming raw would be incorrect. Claim undercooked to your liking sure, but there isn‚Äôt a single person serving this that would say it‚Äôs raw. 

Because it‚Äôs not. It‚Äôs not that hard to grasp.

m98cdnl,t1_m98btb6,1i9pc8v,edited comment will show an (edited) tag beside its time stamp. Looks like you got your rear out with this one. 30+ years and doesn't understand how reddit time stamps work lol.,
m999rhh,t1_m987529,1i9pc8v,"You saying to you it's raw, means you're claiming it's raw. There is no opinion about raw, if it's cooked, even to rare, it's not raw. Again, color is a strong indication, it's pretty clear fat has started to break down, the edges have been browned (not a hard enough sear I'll admit), and the center is pink. With how prime rib is cooked, that would be impossible if it was raw. Rare would be a stretch here, let alone raw.

I'm not trying to sound smart, I'm just explaining the differences in the words, but I appreciate that you thought it seemed so. I just figured you'd start to get it by now. Undercooked is an opinion (which to some people I agree this pic would be, my MIL included), raw isn't one. Raw means uncooked, I really don't know how to explain it more to you. 

I get what you're trying to say, and to you I 100% agree it wouldn't be something you'd be happy to receive (Honestly I'm not a huge prime rib guy either, no matter how it's cooked) but you're not using the right terms. If you wanna say ""it's too raw for my liking"", ehh possibly, ""too rare for my liking"", maybe closer. But claiming it's raw is just incorrect no matter how you look at it, it has been cooked. Undercooked, sure, but still cooked.

Either way, I'm assuming at this point you'd rather be stuck in your ways, and nothing I say matters to you, so I won't bother any more. If you wanna comment again to get the upper hand, throw a few more exclamation points out there, enjoy! At this point, I'll just let you have it, I'm done trying.

Looking at my profile for dirt seems a bit odd, but hey you do you. I don't know what exactly you found, but the one or two times I was wrong recently I admitted to. Anything else you might have deemed as ""wrong"" by downvotes, like Chipotle or Five Guys possibly, is easily confirmed to be correct if you put it in the app. I'm not sure how far back you went, if there was something else, cool? But to my knowledge, I've admitted when I am, or stuck up for myself when I'm not, and I would never claim to know everything. 

Also for the future, if you're gonna say someone has nothing intelligent to say, or they're often wrong, just proofread a little. Using ""passed your bedtime"" instead of ""past"" or ""It has passed"" isn't helping your argument (plus, if it's past my bedtime, wouldn't that just be sleep?) 

Lastly, not that it really matters, but shockingly I was never really into pacifiers as a kid, or thumb sucking. Did have a pretty awesome blankie though.",

Why wuould I NOT order some of the other ingredients to make a proper gyros at home, when: 

I'm already having a delivery from there.  They also have the 2 other items I also need to make a gyro at home.  I needed to order $125 worth of items to use the $50 off coupon. Why wouldn't order the best-selling pre-made tzatziki in the Americass, and when I want a gyro ""just like the restaurant gyros"". and when it so cheap in bulk? 


And I have been disabled all my life.  I do not drive and never have. I even mentioned my lack of car the OP title, I do not easy access to stores like you apparently take for granted and make assumptions.  Every time *I* leave the house for anything it costs at least $25 just for the Ubers to get teh 6 miles and back0  from the nearest bus stops.  Just to get yogurt, sour cream, dill, and mayo just to make a tzatziki that is NOT what I wanted?!?

Pat dry, cover in mustard, score the fat cap a bit so seasoning gets in there.   Season real heavy on all sides.  Put in oven 225-230 overnight on a cooking rack fat side up.  Line pan with foil for easy clean up.  I usually put in at midnight and it's done next afternoon.  I just did one for fathers day that was ~10 lbs and was done around 330-4.  Look for an internal temp between 185-195.  I usually pull around 185 cause the meat will continue.  Wrap in foil once done and then shred after it has cooled.  

Any questions I'd be glad to answer.  It comes out perfect every time and is great for when we have parties.",

l2bvb7o,t3_1cih3pi,1cih3pi,"RECIPE (because I‚Äôm a complete buffoon and accidentally deleted my comment with the steps):

1. Remove from packaging and pat all sides dry with paper towel

2. Cover underside and sides with aluminium foil, leaving the skin exposed

3. Cut slits (as seen in photo), ensuring to cut only through the skin, not the meat

4. Refrigerate for 3 days to get the skin nice and dry- this will help get it crispy!

5. When ready to cook, boil the kettle and pour hot water over the skin, then immediately pat all the sides dry again with paper towel

6. Load pork belly onto baking dish/wire rack and lather the skin with olive oil (roughly 2 teaspoons- just so that the skin is coated)

7. Crack lots of salt onto the skin- use plenty, as a lot of this will pour out of the pork belly when the fat renders/melts

8. Put in the oven at 180 degrees celsius for about 30 minutes, then crank heat to 220 celsius for another 30 minutes. It should be perfect after this, but you can get away with an additional 10-20 minutes at 220 degrees if you want more crisp. The meat is very fatty, so it‚Äôll still be juicy.

Enjoy!

I always wanted to make this and I tried your recipe. Unfortunately I skipped some steps. I did 1.5 days instead of 3 days and skipped the hot water pouring part. It did not come out as crispy as I hoped, so I will try doing all the steps next time. Also I think there is a such thing as too much salt because i was really liberal with it and it was pretty salty. Also I think i put too much olive oil and maybe that also took away some crispiness.

Yeah, it‚Äôs really important to do the three days, as if it‚Äôs not dry enough, it won‚Äôt get very crispy, and the hot water opens up incisions in the skin to allow the oil and heat to penetrate (thus making it crispier).

They paid off scientists to lie for them. Got the government to make sugar and carbs the foundation of the food pyramid. And destroyed the health of the American people.

I promise you that all populations of the longest lived people on earth DO NOT LIMIT FATS. All populations that shun fats have the worst health outcomes.

Unfortunately, according to American law, if a doctor does not go along with all other doctors in their area‚Äîthey are liable for malpractice. This has caused a perpetuation of the made up ‚Äúfat is bad‚Äù lie.

The best examples are Japan and the Mediterraneans. If you eat their diet, you quickly realize that they readily consume 10x more fat than Americans. Yet, they remain thin, do not get diabetes or heart disease. And live longer. Same is true in Scandinavia.

Please don't waste your backstrap by leaving it in the freezer for over a year, and always make sure the processor vacuum bags, if you don't do your own butchering. Those Daisy Seal-A-Meal clones really work great to extend freezer life, and the bags work great for sous vide bags. When we grow more brocolli or cauliflower or green beans than we can use, I vacuum bag meal size portions with herbs and some butter or bacon, and freeze, no blanching needed if you vac bag. then when I take it out to cook, I poke a hole in the bag and microwave to cook, or boil in the bag with the hole above the water. You can use a canning rack or trivet to keep the bag off the bottom of the pan and the hole just out of the water. But we are talking about venison and I got off track. Always vacuum bag. It greatly improves the quality of the meat if it must be stored for several months, and it might possibly enable use of the meat after a couple of years. 4 years is a stretch but again, for ground or stewed, not a big deal, it's all about the spices and herbs, then.",

_Frozen fat won't ""go bad"" in the sense of becoming unsafe to eat due to bacteria growth, it can eventually deteriorate in quality over time due to oxidation, leading to a rancid taste and smell, especially if not properly packaged and stored; therefore, even frozen fat can eventually go bad if left for too long in the freezer, depending on the type of fat and storage method. 
Key points about frozen fat:
Oxidation is the main concern:
The primary way frozen fat can degrade is through oxidation, where the fat molecules break down, causing a rancid flavor and odor. 
Proper packaging is crucial:
Vacuum sealing is the best way to prevent oxidation and extend the shelf life of frozen fat._


I have had multiple year old meat that was fine, but always freeze roasts in water or many layers of Saran wrap. Processed meats go in heavy vacuum bags from a chamber sealer. I would not eat the roast in the picture that the seal obviously broke, but when the seal on a vacuum pack bag is good, my experience is meat is good up to 5 years ( my longest experience) 

 I don't know what I'm doing differently, but if I had packaged the meat that the vacuum seal was still intact after 4 years, I would eat it. Mine is always in a chest freezer that gets opened maybe on average once a week. I can't say you haven't had meat go bad, but I haven't, if it's sealed.

Also, we process our animals. Butcher, grind, sausage, smoke, cure and seal. We know our process and we're clean and responsible.",
m8olp1k,t1_m8n42tn,1i5f80z,That's what she said,
m8wzs8b,t1_m8whtss,1i5f80z,"Yeah, but saying thats a brand new sentence.  The first time they have ever heard of such blasphemy.  I knew right away they are the typical person that just grabs burgers at drive throughs or pre packaged meats with little to no thought about how it got there.  But this is a meat sub.  I imagine I am far from few that are interested in more than burgers and steak around here.  

Anyone that has grown up hunting or worked the back of a restaurant or two wouldn't find my statement very strange at all.  The only reason my statement was a bit impassioned was because I loathe the average consumer mentality and the larger meat industrys approach to slaughtering. Its so wasteful. There is literally health benefits and delicious uses for almost every part of an animal. If it has to die it should be utilized as much as possible.  Well packaged meat kept frozen below 1 degree F can easily last near a decade as long as there is no freezer burn.  The FDA states that if its kept below 0 degrees F and was professionally packaged it should remain safe to eat for a lifetime although the quality of the texture and taste may degrade.  

  But six years is not considered crazy long to any butcher, hunter etc. that I have ever spoken to.  No way I am leaving my tritip, porterhouse, filet mignon, new york, ribeye etc. More than a year if I can help it. But deer neck is a super hardy dense low fat cut that isn't going to change much at all at around the 5-6 year mark in terms of flavor and texture.",

Why does meat go spoiled in. Freezer? 

Jesus christ I can‚Äôt stand redditor experts üòÇ I‚Äôve literally kept vacuumed wild game in my freezers for two decades and cook daily. I‚Äôve opened more rancid meat from freezers than all you people have been near meat in your lives. I‚Äôll just stop arguing and let you live in denial. 

P.s. Nothing personal, I understand not everyone has the experience. But having to argue with 50 headless chickens at the same time is too much. I‚Äôve answered too many comments here already.   

Yes, meat will stay edible forever once frozen. BUT it will go rancid, the fat that is. It will lose its texture, get slimy, get gray, lose its taste. If you want to eat that be my guest. I check my meat before throwing it away or eating it every single time, and 2-3 years is where most of it goes spoiled.  

Why wiuld I lie about this? What do you want, should I invite you the next time I open a rancid piece of meat so that you can travel here and smell & taste it yourself?

Edit: adding a source from a quick google, since you can‚Äôt do it urself. Quote: ‚ÄùFats in meat, fish and poultry become rancid during freezer storage.‚Äù  ( https://extension.missouri.edu/publications/gh1501 )",üòÇ
m8bx9qi,t1_m8bq41e,1i5f80z,"
Since you‚Äôre lazy. Here is the full quote. ‚ÄùFats in meat, fish and poultry become rancid during freezer storage. This rancidity is caused by contact with air left in the package or air that enters the package because proper storage materials were not used. However, even with proper packaging materials, rancidity will occur over time. Off-flavors are the result of this chemical change. Control rancidity by trimming excess fat from meat before freezing, using a wrapping material that prevents air from reaching the product, and storing foods for the recommended length of time.‚Äù 

Now, how long is this recommended length of time you wonder? Check pictured table from my source -or trust me (I know you refuse to). But It‚Äôs 12 months for beef.    

We vacuum our meat with professional equipment (not your average vacumer at home), immediately once cut up. And It staya frozen in my freezer until Its time to cook. And once again: I wouldnt recommend anything over 2-3 years, unless minced",

lt1427c,t1_lt0zzdp,1g8py5j,"Whole Costco ribeye, trimmed and cut into a 6"" roast (remainder cut into 1.5"" steaks and frozen). Coat with salt and place it on a wire rack in the fridge. Leave uncovered for 24-48 hours (I did 24). I used just under a cup of kosher salt for this roast.

Bring out of fridge about 2 hours before cooking to allow it to rise closer to room temperature. Radially tie with butcher's twine to help maintain shape and not overcook the tail.  

Pat surface dry and place on a cast-iron skillet that's set to a medium-low heat. Sear each side for 4-5 minutes, patting dry the side you're about to brown right before you turn the roast. Don't worry too much about color development here -- there's plenty of time to build your crust later.  

Once all sides are initially seared, drop heat to very low. Just above a simmer. Add a third of a stick of butter and a tbsp of canola oil, whole black peppercorns, and some whole garlic cloves. Use a spoon to baste the top of the steak with the hot oil-butter; it should bubble slightly when you put the oil on the top, helping to develop crust in all of the nooks and crannies. Using canola oil with butter and keeping it at a super low temp prevents the milk solids from burning (they were a deep caramel at the end, almost the color of a dark brown roux that's on the verge of becoming ""brick"" for Cajun dishes).

Turn the roast intermittently and continue basting until the core temperature is about 10-15‚Å∞F under your goal. I pulled it out at 115‚Å∞F hoping for closer to 20‚Å∞F increase in temp, but I only got about 10‚Å∞F, so I would leave it on the pan a little longer next time to get the med-rare that I think ribeye is best at. Tent with foil and allow to rest for at least 20 minutes before serving. About 90 minutes from sear to tent.  

Pan sauce: An indeterminate amount of red wine blend to deglaze the pan, tbsp of whole-seed Dijon mustard, dash of Worcestershire and garlic powder, tbsp of brown sugar, tbsp of butter. Cooked until I could no longer smell the alcohol vapors and it passed the spoon test to my liking.",

I grew up familiar with organ meats, etc and also exposed to butchering animals but huge sections of the country can be totally oblivious to the concept of eating any meat other than muscle. For a lot of people it's rare to have it all that recognizable as a portion of a dead animal. I had a conversation with a teenager who was shocked that a chicken drumstick is an animal's leg and so is a ham bone. Basically their experience of meat was ground, pressed, and otherwise processed beyond recognition. I discussed blood sausage, liver, brain, tongue, sweetmeats etc and they said it would have made them go vegan if meat wasn't so delicious.  Kid was aware there was a ""bone"" but hadn't fully processed that.

On a barbecue this does look a lot like a link sausage which in some regions are often split lengthwise before grilling resulting in a similar shape, the bone looks like an unusual sausage casing.

>How to prepare bone marrow for cooking

>While marrow is present in all bones, not all bones are suitable for making this dish. Ideally you want to find a specific large marrow bone (e.g. not soup bones). Visit your local butcher and request a beautiful piece of bone marrow, and ask them to cut it for you lengthwise.

>Before you start cooking, some preparation is required.

>1. Soak the bones one day in advance

>Put the bone marrow in salted water and keep it in the refrigerator for at least 24 hours to remove any blood spots and bacteria. This process ‚Äúbleaches‚Äù out as much of that blood as possible, and also firms up the marrow.¬†

>The next day, you‚Äôll notice how clean it is. The longer you leave it, the more blood will be extracted from the bones.

My not eating meat doesn‚Äôt come from any outright objection to meat eating, I take issue that the majority of meat in America comes from commercial farming practices which not only disrespects the animals themselves but produces unfathomable amounts of waste as their goal is purely to make a profit. I take absolutely no issue with small farming practices or indigenous hunting practices so long as they respect the animal and minimize suffering, my concern remains completely with the treatment of the animal and how the death of their body is honoured.

Either way, I genuinely don‚Äôt care to pass judgement on anyone for eating meat as I myself don‚Äôt wish to be judged for not eating it‚Äî my objection lies less upon the individual as it does the United States tacitly legalizing horrendous animal abuse so long as it‚Äôs done to livestock in the name of profit.

Salt in the soak means that the salt that is naturally part of the marrow doesn't try to move out to the soak solution and wash out the flavor with it. No harm if salt moves from the solution into the marrow.

All meat is salty, we have saline solution not fresh water in our bodies, in humans and I think most animals at least mammals it's close to the salinity of ocean water (which actually varies quite a bit)",

Braising doesn't produce results that match up all that well with bbq. But hot smoking is basically just roasting with smoke. You can do the same thing in an oven. 

Tends to work better at slightly higher temps than you'd use in a smoker (275-300f) than at temps often quoted for barbecue. And you may not encounter much of a stall due to the differences in airflow. But you can literally just follow a barbecue recipe and you'll get solid cue.

I sous vide it days ahead and keep it in the fridge after the sous vide. Pour the juices into an electric turkey roaster set to ~135F while reheating the brisket in the oven for ~3 hours. Pull the meat, slice thin, and add to the roaster. The juices keep the meat moist for hours.

Made 3 flats this way for my wife's birthday party (~25 lbs of meat) and it was completely painless compared to trying to smoke that much.

I do add the curing salt to get the salt ring. If using a whole brisket, I separate the point and flat. The ""FoodSaver Expandable Heat-Seal"" rolls are a must.

Smoke is one way in is transferred from the coals (source) to the meat, but it's actually a very small portion of the actual contents of a smoker. Accordingly, the primary purpose of the smoke is flavor, not energy transfer.

The burning of charcoal is actually a chemical reaction. Nominally, the pure carbon (C) in charcoal reacts with oxygen (O2) to form CO2 and lots of heat. That heat is carried by the CO2. That's what flames are. The flames you see are actually the CO2 gases produced by that chemical reaction that are so hot they're actually glowing. In reality, it's not pure carbon, and carbon monoxide and carbon dioxide are both produced along with some other stuff, including the smoke. (The carbon monoxide is what actually produces the smoke ring).

When you're smoker is going, it's 1) taking in air. 2) using some of the oxygen in the air to drive the chemical reaction that produces the heat, combustion gases, and smoke 3) using the heat produced to heat all the rest of the air it was drawing in 4) passing that hot air over the food being cooked.

Heat is also transferred by direct infrared radiation and it's also absorbed by the smoker itself and reradiated back out.",

l8iq8db,t1_l8hbcna,1dezbfz,"Thanks, bro, I too have been smoking for a spell, over 25 years, and I am very aware of the science behind it also. Your explanations are really on point, correct.

I was responding to your comment that smokers do not cook, which is incorrect. But I misread your comment in thst yiu did say the temperature cooks it, which I totally agree with. My apologies for that part.

The heat that is created is what does the cooking. The low temp of the meat compared to that of the chamber is why the meat would absorb the smoke, similar to the process of brining. That I find is what many people strive for in the ""smoke ring"" in meats. I've found that you do not necessarily need an intense smoke ring to achieve a smoky taste. 

I've even seen Good results from people using liquid smoke indoors. I have not used it, bur some people I know have, and it's fascinating.

Yet once the meat reaches temperatures that the water in the meat starts to steam out, then it is no longer absorbing smoke and steaming out which would make it dry. That is the purpose of wrapping it, to retain that moisture. I've found thar this where many have issues with, it's pretty simple, though, if one pays attention

If yiure doing a dry / cold smoke, which is at a much lower temperature,  it still cooks the meat but also dries it. This is where Jerry, and slow smoked salmon that is used as a preservative, say in the far north during a winter in the artic. Or generally as a treat wherever. But one can make a fish smoker in the woods to dry smoke fish for winter consumption.

To yiur last point, this is really an important thing many dint consider. I was just discussing bbq with a friend today that has a pellet grill. He's cooking up a whole prime rib this weekend. I was discussing the importance of preheating the whole vessel at least 1.5 - 2 hrs ahead of time because those chamber temps if not stabilized first, can really alter the cook times, and consistency.",

Oh they were a thing. People were just buying pot vaporizers at head shops to do it. I have friend who staged at WD-50 20ish years ago. He was literally sent to a head shop and told specifically what vaporizer to buy. And they'd already been a commonly used thing in high end kitchens for a while by then.

Most people don't seem to realize that's the history of that particular device. But there's still pot vaporizers that are nearly identical in design.

They're more useful for cocktails. Where getting smoke quickly adhered to a glass, ice cube, or garnish is more practical.

You *can* get some genuine smoke character off the gun. The issue with them they don't actually circulate smoke well, and you want the heavier smoke to pass over the food and vent out before it condenses. So only lighter compounds flavor things. Combined with the fact that they only burn a small amount of material.

So you basically trap the food under a cover, make a vent at both sides. Hose goes in one side, smoke gets vented out the other. And then just repeatedly load the thing and blow smoke through the container.

It's a pain the ass. And needs to be done separately, before you start cooking. And you need to be outside or have serious smoke hood.

Not generally worth it. But it works better than stove top or in oven smoking. If only because it actually works.",

Beef as a product is actually pretty safe to consume raw at this point. There's always some inherent risk, but it's pretty low these days. Please note never to eat pre-ground ground beef or similarly processed product, like sliced thin raw. I do agree with your suggestion to remove an outside layer, really only if it's been exposed to air for a while (not cryovacced or fresh cut that day).

Now all that being said, I do am not aware of shahimi where the Wagyu is completely raw. What I see is sliced a couple mm thick in the same shape as other sashimi, and seared extremely quickly on both sides.",

les0mxi,t3_1eauvrq,1eauvrq,"I'm going to go against the grain here and say no, but I have a reason so hear me out.

In general, yes the vacuum sealed bags are fine for the posted date. However, for THIS SPECIFIC example, I would say no, I don't think it'll last that long.

My reasoning is that I can already see little bubbles and air pockets forming inside the bag. That leads me to believe that either there is already a small hole in the bag, or it was not sealed correctly to start with. In either case, you probably have another 5 days tops here before it starts to spoil on the surface.

I'm interested to see what the rest of the bag looks like you have a zoomed out photo. I used to be a meat cutter at a grocery store, eventually you learn the signs of improperly sealed or busted bags.

You can however open it, cut it into steaks, and then seal them in storage bags and freeze, or vacuum seal and freeze. If you vacuum seal and refrigerate you'll probably get 10 days out of it, but if you freeze, idk 6 months propably.",

We have used salt to preserve meat for thousands of years before refreigeration. So having it in a salt brine is likely to have saved it.

However, how contaminated was it when they packaged it and is it still sealed?

We have no way of knowing, best to open it and take a look at the meat and smell, the smell will tell you.

If it wasn't in brine or sealed or hamburger meat, it would probably be bad, but the salt brine can definitely keep things for a long time",

If the seal is broken you need to check the meat and use within 4 days under refrigeration  33-37f for us.
If the seal is not broken you are good to open up to the use by date, and then you have three safe days to sell after you break the seal.

This is not to say things can't happen but that lifespan is decided by the FDA because it is a reliable safe timeframe for meat . After that time the good microorgs get out competed by the unsafe ones and illness can arise/ bad orgs reach a threshold that'll make you sick.",

Whole cuts that are cryovacced can be held for long periods of time in the fridge. 

Muscle tissue is considered sterile, so generally the risk for bacteria is on the surface of the meat. When cryovacced, you are stopping any contact with bacteria or air. 

All meat is ""rotting"", as soon as the steer is dispatched. But you need to catch it at the right place in the process of decay. For instance, you wouldn't want to eat a cow in rigor. The vacuum seal slows that process down tremendously. 

It's the same reason you can dry age beef. Kept in the correct conditions and a cold enough fridge (yeah if you're a weirdo that keeps their fridge at 42¬∞, don't try this) then you'll be fine to keep it for a month.",

Took the family to a small mom and pop looking restaurant. Wife got a roast beef sandwich, kids got obligatory cheese pizza/chicken nugget meals. I got the 'special', whitefish with two sides. Meals come out, pretty tasty, everybody happy. Server asks how we like our meals, we all say great. I ask what kind of fish it is, she doesn't know but will find out.

Big hulking dude appears table side, ""somebody hadda problem wit dah fish?"" I say no, fish is good, I just wanted to know what kind of fish. He looks around, spots someone having the same fish and asks if they like it. He looks back at me and says ""everybody likes the fish."" I tell him again that I like it, but what is it? He comes right to the table, leans down on it, gets right in my face looking me in the eye and says, "" look, it's fish, see?"" In a way that makes me realize that I now know all I needed to know about the fish. Wife and both kids are looking me all wide-eyed. He starts to walk away, but looks back smiling, and says to my wife, ""your not regulars?"" She explains we just stopped on our way on a vacation trip. He just kind of  nodded and walked away.

We quickly finished up, paid and left.

Whitefish is a mild-flavored, often slightly sweet fish that can be used interchangeably in recipes. This is how restaurants can try keeping prices down because they can go to the fish markets and purchase the best priced ""whitefish"" which is typically determined by the market and whats in season, etc...

When you're a chef in a restaurant cooking a whitefish dishes daily where the fish coming from market could be different each day, I doubt they really care what species of fish it is if the one purchasing or selling them the whitefish dependently brings them good whitefish.

Edit: in this case the grocery store purchased whitefish from a fish market knowing it would be purchased by a buyer for a whitefish recipe.",

People who only buy it in the store call it mahi mahi and have never heard it called dolphin. Efforts to market dolphin, a very tasty fish, easy to catch and reaching very nice size, initially failed. It was too hard to educate buyers who were horrified that people were murdering, butchering, and selling poor Flipper and whose attention span was too short to absorb the fact that this is a FISH, not the friendly smiling mammal that entertains them at Sea World. So the marketing wonks dusted off a name from an obscure language spoken fluently by maybe 100,000 people in the whole world, marketed the fish under this borrowed name from another language altogether, and suddenly it was the new seafood on the block and people in Iowa and Missouri and South Dakota couldn't get enough of it. When I was a kid, you NEVER saw this in the store. You went out in the gulf and caught a couple dozen and had a year's worth of fish for the house. When I was shrimping we would often throw a hook tied to a piece of net twine in the water after clearing the deck in the morning or before picking up the anchor before sunset to start dragging. Super easy to catch. They bite enthusiastically and ferociously and occasionally get as big as six feet long and average about 3 feet. They love to hang out in the shade under the boat during the day. People are naturally stupid when intelligence is no longer required for survival, and have no patience with those who would try to teach them something.

It's a common trait of people with ADHD and those on the spectrum. My wife works in behavioral health so I'm familiar with people with your condition.

Maybe you have not been diagnosed. In which case, I would suggest you see a therapist and/or psychologist. Or maybe you have been diagnosed. In which case, I would suggest you see a therapist and/or psychologist.",

So that's your excuse? Seems flimsy. 

>The greater issue is you're a prick picking unprovoked fights everywhere you go. 

You literally came here to start a fight with me lmfao. I just explained that easily googleable questions are easily googleable. You chose to be offended by that (or maybe you just couldn't help it). 

>Maybe you have not been diagnosed. In which case, I would suggest you see a therapist and/or psychologist. Or maybe you have been diagnosed. In which case, I would suggest you see a therapist and/or psychologist.

Ya, maybe talk to your wife or a real therapist or something. It's sad to see you *this* worked up over a stranger on the Internet telling another stranger on the Internet that their question was easily googleable. 

Honestly, I think you just need to get off reddit for a bit.",
l7gp8bf,t1_l7gmtjc,1d8ntx4,Bro I just read that whole thing and your superiority complex is crazy. Everyone who disagrees with you isn‚Äôt an imbecile maybe look at yourself and how much of a dick you are to everyone around you. I know you don‚Äôt care about people on the internet but just because you don‚Äôt care doesn‚Äôt mean you don‚Äôt have to be a decent human being.,

l7e5hwb,t1_l7e2z5j,1d8ntx4,"And we're back to your inability to read. I replied to your comment about getting an answer in seconds rather than hours, i.e. wasting time. I made a lighthearted joke that triggered you ‚Äì another sign of a neurological disorder. And you've been throwing a tantrum ever since. 

Your behavior is not normal. It is treatable to some degree. I suggest you take advantage of that. While you may find being an ass on Reddit to be cathartic, it is not therapeutic. It only reinforces negative behaviors that likely interfere with your relationships in real life. Assuming you have any left at this point.

Anyway, I've grown tired of slapping you around. At first it was entertaining as you are a prick. But now that I see my suspicion of a neurological disorder is almost certainly correct, I feel bad picking on someone incapable of controlling their behavior. So I'll leave you to address it or not. At this point, you're only hurting yourself ignoring it.",

l7gtpyo,t1_l7grqmd,1d8ntx4,See that‚Äôs what I‚Äôm talking about. Calling people slurs and telling them to fuck off is not being a decent human. Your original comment wasn‚Äôt bad if not a little mean and then you just made it worse and worse for yourself by saying more and more.,
l7h2rsg,t1_l7grqmd,1d8ntx4,It was obviously an insult. At least stand on your word. How much of a wuss are you?,
l60j18t,t3_1d2gz5n,1d2gz5n,I love that garlic butter dry seasoning.   It's potent!,

l62q150,t1_l61x7jm,1d2gz5n,Interesting take sounds great,
l66fn4l,t1_l64j9co,1d2gz5n,I would do it in a cast iron on medium heat and rotate every 3 minutes till the beef reaches 135 internal,
