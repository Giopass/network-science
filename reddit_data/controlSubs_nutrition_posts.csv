nutrition,"Think about it, my dogs eat only the dog ration and live a long healthy life (for a dog). But if I want the same as a human I need to carefully spend my money on a balanced and diversified diet worrying about a lot of things that are expensive and/or harmful for me.

Dogs have it so much easier:

* Much cheaper than human food (one bag that lasts weeks costs less than a fancy human dinner)
* Instantly ready for consumption out of the bag
* Dry/clean, doesn't make a mess for cooking nor cleaning
* Convenient, just pellets that can be eaten on the go
* Long expiry date, can be stored for months
* Healthy. Contains everything the dog needs - proteins, calories, vitamins all in the correct dosage
* I'm assuming somewhat tasty for most dogs. Many flavours and textures available anyway.

How come there isn't a human equivalent of this? It would save me so much time and money to just be able to eat something that I know is healthy without the hassle of cooking or the expenses of going to a restaurant. Not to mention it would make it much easier to combat world hunger with something cheap that doesn't spoil fast.

nutrition,"It feels like 90% of “nutrition” advice I see just says “eat more protein” and treats all carbs like they’re the same and says “actually the real problem is [saturated fat/seed oils/etc]” while completely ignoring the lack of fiber. Anecdotally, it honestly feels like it’s very very easy to eat a really high-protein diet and still be really unhealthy and eat a lot of refined carbs and no fiber. I see it literally all the time. I live in the US. 

I’ve seen tons of people say to avoid satiating whole foods like potatoes and lentils and oats because they’re “high in carbs”. This just seems so backward.
 
Why is fiber grouped in with carbs so often? I feel like it’s hard to discern how healthy a carbohydrate is just based off the calorie count for carbs and that’s what leads people to treat all carbs like they’re the same and not differentiate between refined grains, whole grains, and vegetables. 

It feels like this is an outdated way of thinking from before the food supply was inundated with cheap refined carbohydrates. 
Fiber used to be part of all carbs by default, so we never needed to think about fiber intake, but after the major changes in our food supply in the last few decades (divorce of fiber from energy in carbs), it seems we need to update our thinking or continue to suffer increasingly from health problems and gut problems that come with inflammatory refined carbohydrates.

nutrition,"I'm currently reading ""How Not to Age,"" by Michael Greger. He emphatically recommends lowering, or ideally entirely cutting out animal protein, and reducing overall protein intake to around the RDI. He cites a convincing amount of literature suggesting that the constant stream of IGF-1 resulting from high protein diets (even from vegetarian sources) torpedos longevity and dramatically increases risk of cancer and heart disease.

Contrast that with other researchers (like that of Peter Attia for instance) who argue that a protein intake of 2-3x the RDI is critical for building and maintaining muscle, especially as we age. He recommends *increasing* protein intake, especially as one gets older, since frailty is as great a risk as any other morbidity. Attia also seems to think the the apparent link between animal protein and disease is not justified by the data.
