vegan,"Crabs CAN feel pain, scientists say - as they call for an immediate ban on boiling crabs. 

This study revealed the first evidence that crabs process pain in the exact same way as humans.

And what is true for crabs is almost certainly true for other crustaceans with a similar structure and nervous system.

Meaning this would be the same for lobsters at your local store.

A light of these findings, the researchers say is an urgent need for more legal protection for crabs' welfare.

In the EU crustaceans are one of the few animals not covered by welfare laws meaning there are no guidelines on how to handle them in the lab or kitchen.

That means it is legal to cut up or boil crabs while they are still alive which not the case for mammals.

Mr. Kasiouras adds: 'In the UK, decapod crustaceans are considered sentient so definitely the animal welfare legislations should be extended to cover these groups of animals too.'

vegan,"I’ve been told more times than I can count that I (and my girlfriend) should open a restaurant, but in the vast majority of cities, we’d be destined to fail. 

I’ve made food for family, friends, and coworkers and labeled it at times as vegan, other times as not. When I don’t say it’s vegan, people eat it en masse and have nothing negative to say. If I have a “vegan” note by it, a majority of people refuse to try it, and those who do swear that “it tastes vegan.”  

There has to be a fine line in selling quality vegan food without telling people it’s vegan — you immediately lose a good 90% of potential customers when you mention your food as being vegan because so many people are needlessly close-minded. It’s just frustrating.

vegan,"EDIT:

DEAR EVERYONE SAYING ""DONT EAT OUT, DONT GO TO NON VEGAN RESTURANTS BLAH BLAH BLAH"" 
I have to go to company dinners for my job. My job is a lot of socializing and networking. I am invited to dinners every week. I never have a choice of where to go. I'm not looking for solutions, I cook all week long. Every single meal. I am just making a relatable post to other vegans. Chilllllllll 
END OF EDIT :) 

EDIT #2:
my takeaway from negative comments saying ""restaurants don't have to cater to vegans because they are a minority"" Well then why have an option listed as vegan? My entire point is if you're going to have a vegan option, at least make it good. It doesn't take a Michilin Star chef to make vegetables taste good. If you're going to have falafel as your one vegan option, why make it dry and tasteless? Why not make it the best falafel ever that way non vegans who love falafel will enjoy it too! I never even once mentioned going to restaurants that don't have one vegan option. If there wasn't at least one option listed vegan I would eat before going if I am going for a social event, but I expect if the restaurant is incredible that they will put just as much care into the one vegan option, or why have it at all? 

EDIT #3: when I said I'd rather starve, I was joking. I also am not rich and cannot afford to buy a meal that doesn't taste good, so in that case yes I'd rather be hungry for a few hours at a social event than waste $30 on a bowl of mushy truffle rissoto.  It's NEVER good. 

No, I do not want a salad. 
If I have one more dry falafel hummus platter I will lose my mind. 
Who agreed the universal fine dining option was wild mushroom truffle risotto? I'd rather starve. 
If you're going to have an impossible burger at least make the bun and cheese vegan, why would I ever want it on a lettuce wrap?
No I am not gluten free, and nor do not want the gluten free option. BECAUSE IT USUALLY HAS EGG IN IT!! 

And don't get me started on $28 cauliflower ""steak"" with romesco sauce. 

Sincerely,
The entire vegan community that would be happy with tofu, sauce and rice (not quinoa, RICE) 
Thank you.

vegan,"I recently went to jail in the US unexpectedly (I wont say why sorry). As I was getting booked they asked about allergies etc. I had the notion to tell them I was allergic to dairy and meat since it sounded more solid than religious reasons. (although I genuinely do not know how my body would react to animal products after 11 years without them) I ended up being locked up for 60 days but I actually had no idea how long I would be in there for, I've never been ""in trouble"" before and I kept expecting to get out the next day.

The first 3 days were the worst mentally, there were cockroaches crawling around the cell and my bunk mate was literally farting and snoring like you wouldn't believe and people nearby were constantly screaming in pain from withdraws and being cold. I wasn't given any food that was vegan despite me listing the allergy. I would mention my \*allergy\* to the guards aka correction officers but they just gave me the run around. I think day 4 or 5 everyone got a peanut butter jelly sandwich which was a huge moment for me (ha) but usually it was some kind of meat sandwich and cow milk/ hardboiled eggs. I basically only ate some cookies, bread, and water for 7 days.

I got moved into general population after being in that intake cell area, where they actually had veggie burgers and green beans. This was super exciting for the first.... 5 days or so but it got disgusting fast as it was the ONLY thing I got every day (besides cereal and water for breakfast lol)….I don't know how to describe jail veggie burgers, its just a patty and bun nothing else -there's something in them that have this super weird taste and I'm not a picky eater.  but trust me its not good and I kinda have nightmares about them now lol.  it also felt bad that everyone else got to have a 2nd source of nutrition/ flavor which was cold boxed milk for breakfast/lunch. its nice that I got to trade it for things but there was literally no fruit obtainable whatsoever and I could tell my diet was massively lacking nutritional value.

Luckily there is this thing called commissary where if friends or family send you money on your account you can buy random stuff like Oreos and peanut butter/jelly/ramen etc. I would often trade my milk for ramen or whatever (sometimes trading veggie burgers because that was a new flavor for some people and I often just couldn't stomach them) but the food options were extremely limited and basically only PB+J / ramen, but I had to ration it because I only had so much $ and things to trade plus its smart to not make big orders or people will target you for having stuff.

Since I have been vegan for over a decade I wasn't about to break that plus the thought of eating animal products disgusts me, especially since I felt EXACTLY like an animal in a cage. I kept holding out because I know people can water fast for month(s?) but I was almost at my breaking point.  If I had to be in there for a year or more I don't know if it would be possible.  I think it would be possible to do more trades like washing peoples socks for ramen, etc. and I could have maybe obtained more calories but my approach was to do minimal workouts and sleep as much as possible to conserve energy haha. ( I would be very curious what a nutritionists perspective here would be)

I'm not sure if its when people are lacking mental stimulation or if its just not having good food to eat, but food becomes an \*obsession\*. I don't think I once thought about sex or other vices but I thought about food almost constantly.  The thing I fantasized about the most was a smoothie or cold juice or cold clean water.  There is some serious motivation to have new flavors,  but really very little you can do about it.  Luckily there were books to keep my mind somewhat busy, I think I read over 60  although many were cheesy romance novels I was basically forced to read haha.

I actually don't remember if I told people I was vegan or not, I probably just told people at first I cant eat it and left it at that but there are \*no\* secrets in a place like that and I did end up talking about it with some people.   The funny thing is some of the ""big bad"" dudes in there were the most receptive to hearing about veganism, I think because its super easy to relate to being that animal in a cage when you ARE an animal in a cage.  its also easy to talk story and share beliefs etc. because honestly everyone's kind of bored ha.  Nobody hassled me about it tho which is kinda ironic because I bet more people get hassled about it at work lol.

I was already a skinny person and by the end of it I lost at least 20 pounds, you could see my ribs and I kinda just looked like one of those starving children lol. OK not quite that bad but when I finally bailed out I think I went a little overboard on food as I gained all my weight back and then some.  I am back to normal now and luckily all my charges were eventually dropped but it really seems to be one of those issues no one cares about until it happens to you. I'm grateful for the humbling experience and lessons.  At least now I know you can cook ramen inside the package with only warm water and can claim I actually have read some books haha.

Not all animals locked in a cage have fur, and not all inmates are \*animals\*

If there's anything I want people to get out of this its to not take your food and freedoms  for granted.

Can we petition for more vegan options in jail or something? (and maybe donate a good book 😛) I wonder if anyone else has had similar experiences or if some jails are better and have things like \*fruit\* lol

vegan,"**Today's my veganniversary! In no particular order, here are 22 things I've learned in 22 years of being vegan:**

(1) The most challenging part of being vegan is existing in a society that is willfully ignorant of — or desensitized to — animal abuse.

(2) Don’t conflate veganism with health. Veganism is an ethical standpoint, not a “diet”.

(3) The dairy, egg, and meat industries are intertwined and morally indistinguishable from each other. If you care about animals, veganism is the only answer. (Eggs support the chicken meat industry, dairy supports the veal industry, etc.)

(4) Ever heard of kwashiorkor? (It’s the clinical term for protein deficiency.) In populations and areas of the world where chronic caloric deficiencies aren’t common, protein deficiency doesn’t exist.

(5) That said, protein is more important than many vegans think. The common “recommendation” of 0.8 grams per kilogram of body weight per day is the absolute minimum, for sedentary people, to prevent health issues. If you’re active, an older adult, or in a caloric deficit to lose weight, you’ll need more.

(6) Being vegan is a privilege. 

(7) There are 20,000 edible plant species. Expand your palette.

(8) In over 2 decades of being vegan, the most common trolling question I’ve come across is not, “But where do you get your protein?!” It’s, “If you’re so against eating animals, why do you eat faux meats and call them things like ‘vegan chicken’ or ‘vegan bacon’?” Depending on the audience and the level of ill intent, here are my response options:

\- Have we forgotten how adjectives work? Are you equally outraged by phrases like “paper tiger”, “water gun”, and “toy car”?

\- I didn’t go vegan because I disliked the taste of meat. I went vegan because I’m against animal abuse and commodification. Eating faux meats is similar to enjoying decaf coffee, non-alcoholic beer, gluten-free bread, or sugar-free soda. Same experience, no negative consequences.

\- The same reason people use sex toys. Same feel, same look, minus the heartbreak.

(9) Pseudoscience is one of the biggest threats to veganism at large. Detoxes, water fasts, fruitarianism, raw veganism, alkaline diets, and avoiding seed oils are not evidence-based. 

(10) For anyone remotely concerned about climate change, eating a plant-based diet is one of the most impactful actions you can take.

(11) There’s a time and a place for many different forms of activism. My go-to’s? Education via books, articles, podcast episodes (syndicated on radio), and social posts; bullshit-busting; helping folks all over the world get super strong and fuel their workouts with plants; and just doin’ my thing and making sure people know I’m open to conversations at any time.

(12) It’s just as important to consider the method of delivery as the message itself. Certain forms of vegan activism further alienate people from considering plant-based diets. Read the room, meet people where they’re at, and lead by example.

(13) Creating ridiculously delicious desserts is one of the best ways I’ve found to engage folks in conversations about eating more plant-based foods.

(14) A “whole-food, plant-based” diet devoid of oil, sugar, or packaged foods is exclusionary and unnecessary. 

(15) Intersectional veganism recognizes and addresses the interconnected systems of oppression, such as racism, sexism, classism, and ableism, that impact humans, non-human animals, and the environment. To make veganism as accessible as possible for as many people as possible, this is the necessary approach.

(16) Fortification is not a sign that a plant-based diet is “inadequate”. Eggs, milk, and yogurt are fortified, too.

(17) Animal products contain high levels of B12 because those animals were given B12 supplements themselves. Just take your B12 pill and call it a day.

(18) Just because you can’t be “perfect” doesn’t mean you shouldn’t do anything at all. We live in a non-vegan world. Paint, mobile phones, batteries, cars, and many more everyday items contain animal products. Focus on the actions you can take that are within your control, within your means, and sustainable long-term.

(19) Soy will not mess with your hormones or give you “man boobs” — or any other kind of boobs. I’ve been consuming soy daily for 27+ years and I’m still waiting for mine to appear.

(20) Engaging with internet trolls isn’t about changing anyone’s minds. It’s about showing those passing by (who may not engage at all) that rude and uninformed behaviour is unacceptable.

(21) Just like omnivores, vegans are not a monolith.

(22) Dark chocolate is life.",22 things I've learned in 22 years of being vegan,t2_13teff,0.97,1397,1735769198.0,1735769198.0,234,TheNoBullshitVegan,1hrdvtl

vegan,"Time and time again I see commenters on this sub belittle new vegans/vegan-curious individuals. Just today I saw it happen to someone. This individual expressed interest in veganism & asked some of those questions that we've all heard (what about avocados, eating meat is natural, etc.). Look, I get that it might be annoying to hear the same questions over and over. But non-vegans genuinely don't know the answers to these questions. This is for us to educate them.

I get if you want to direct someone to another sub, because maybe this isn't the right sub for some conversations. Though please stop mocking others, it is getting to be very irritating. We all have the same goal I imagine-- to stop animal exploitation. Anyone who joins that cause, or is curious about joining that cause, should be treated with compassion. Belittling them just guarantees that they leave & don't consider the point further.

I know that there are some trolls that hang around here and give us a bad name, but on some posts the proportion of unhelpful comments is just too high.

vegan,"Lately I've seen a lot of people hating on people who decide to lower their intake of animal products but not stop completely.

I find the hate completely understandable, ""Oh I don't take lives on weekdays"" is morally completely wrong after all. But completely insulting these people isn't the right thing to do. Again feeling hatred towards this is completely justified. But if you scare someone out of being a flexitarian for example, you're basically doubling their meat in take.

I think instantly throwing insults and talking in a very condescending tone is the last thing we should do. People who have decided to at least do something are at least aware enough to think about it. So remind them that what they're doing is helpful, but they're still harming animals for food, without sounding like you have a superiority complex over them.

I've really thought about it recently, and veganism just doesn't make sense. Humans are at the top of the food chain, if you think about it, otherwise we'd still be in caves.

Also, crop deaths tho. And what would we do with all of the cows if we stopped eating them?

Why is soy milk so expensive? When I went vegan 10 years ago it was WAY cheaper. It's literally made from the food that most people's food eats. I am doubtful it's all inflation, it appears to have gotten much more expensive faster than other grocery staples like bread.

Now there's two ways I (we) could approach this information:

A) tell that person that their small change doesn't matter and they're still the problem unless they go cold turkey.

B) congratulate them on their new decision, share some veggie recipes or restaurants and offer to help with any advice they might need.
