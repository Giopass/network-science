carnivorediet,"14 years ago today, I signed off my will and went to make funeral plans.  Doctors had nothing to offer except maybe….. a big maybe….a liver transplant when my liver failed.

Other than that, a slow decline to death….maybe 5 years, maybe more or less.  Trouble was, I was only 47 and not ready to get my coat.

I found George Henderson on the forum I’d joined, who told me the quickest path to health was keto. And he was right and I’ve never looked back.

I was keto for about 9 years and now carnivore for 4 1/2.  Still have some issues, my electrolytes are a bit skittish and I struggle to maintain weight.

I can’t eat beef because of the histamines, so I’m a lamb and salmon eater with buffalo/goats milk and beef suet.  

So here I am at 61.  I swam 5 miles in Ullswater yesterday, been hiking miles this week.  A photo of me on the 60th birthday I thought I’d never have.

carnivorediet,"A little update for those new to Carnivore or wondering if it’s effective for weight loss:

I’m 46 and have been doing Carnivore for 9 months now and have lost around 90 lbs. 

Let me tell you, I’ve tried it all. Atkins, South Beach, Weight Watchers, Jenny Craig, Keto, the Cabbage Soup Diet, and even John’s Fat Boy Diet (yes, that’s a real thing). I’ve starved myself, sweated through boot camps, and signed up for more gym memberships and at-home programs than I care to admit. If I added up everything I’ve spent trying to lose weight, I could probably take a luxury vacation—and still, none of it was worth it.

Here’s the truth: I’m a food addict. Even now, while doing Carnivore, I still think about food. The good news is, it’s not nearly as bad as it used to be, and I haven’t cheated once in these nine months. But that doesn’t mean I don’t occasionally daydream about the foods I’ve left behind—or, yes, even dream about them at night.

What’s tough is how much of life revolves around food. Parties, holidays, dinners out—it’s everywhere. And people don’t always understand when I say, “No thank you, I can’t make it to your birthday at Chili’s.” They’ll insist, “But there’s meat there! You can eat that!”

What they don’t get is that this isn’t just about the food—it’s about addiction. Admitting that out loud feels a little silly sometimes, but it’s real. Fighting those urges takes serious mental strength.

So, if you’re wondering whether Carnivore can work for weight loss: for me, it’s been life-changing. But it’s also been a journey of self-awareness, boundaries, and confronting some pretty tough truths about my relationship with food.",9 months Carnivore Results ,t2_29pq3z9w,0.99,1060,1736188117.0,1736188117.0,190,Cherry_DeVille,1hv5y1e

Strict except for 10 days in October due to travelling and a couple days at Christmas. Back on it immediately after with no ill effects (either switching off or back on).

carnivorediet,"I want to share this story with anyone that struggles with any type of mental health issues. This older photo on the right side was a person that was completely addicted to food, and not just any food, ultra processed food. Everything that is bad for you. I knew the consequences of this lifestyle,I actually chose it. I was slowly poisoning myself, and My train was ready to derail. I had all the major symptoms anyone that chose this lifestyle would have. Most likely type ll diabetes, high blood pressure, major depression,anxiety,ADD, If a grizzly bear was chasing me, I couldn’t sprint 10 feet. Anyone that knows me deep inside, knows I’m a fighter, When I get an idea in my head I can’t be stopped. But on the other side, I’m extremely shy, I can have crippling self doubt, and worth. In 2018 I met the woman that would later become my wife, and early into our relationship, she told me that she worried for my health. She would watch me toss and turn not able to sleep because I wasn’t breathing. What next transpired was The insecure part of my brain actually making a decision to turn on the Spartan warrior I have deep inside. My failure of maybe losing my then fiancée, shocked my system, and the next day I stopped all ultra processed food, and learned to eat the proper human diet.  I am 5’5” when I started this change I weighed 265 lbs, and was stage lll morbidly obese. After removing all carbs, and ultra processed food, I am off all meds (4 total, 1 I was on for 30 years) I am now still 5’5” and weigh 150 lbs! I lost 115 pounds. I haven’t eaten a carb in over 2 years. I encourage anyone that wants help, or needs to talk, shoot me a dm , I’ll lend an ear, life has to be about helping others. I really believe this.

carnivorediet,"I don’t see many acne success stories here, so I wanted to share mine.

I had a few pimples here and there growing up, and would routinely go to the dermatologist. Using the basic benzoyl peroxide topicals easily combated these. Towards the end of college, my acne ramped up and warranted some stronger stuff. I’m prone to cysts, so after a couple of bad ones, they put me on doxycycline (for way too long). After the last round, my gut and skin were never the same. Full-blown warfare on my face, neck, back, and chest. I’m talking cysts the size of marbles that had to be surgically removed. The worst were the ones on my scalp…

Name an acne cream or supplement, and I’ve taken it. I got prescribed Accutane but never took it because of the horror stories I came across. After reading these stories, I embarked on a journey of trying to heal my gut/skin the 'natural way.' This eventually led me down the path of veganism for 8 months. The picture collage you see is my skin at its worst and when I was a full-blown vegan. The more plant matter I ate, the more acne I got. I lost 15lbs of muscle, anxiety was through the roof, and I was super depressed. OCD got really bad, and at its peak, I was showering 2-3 times a day, using copious amounts of toxic cleansers and creams, using a new towel every time I showered, and changing my pillowcase every single night (crazy, I know).

I found carnivore a little over 2 years ago, and it was the answer to all of my problems. I noticed improvement within days of cutting out all plant matter. Skin and gut inflammation dropped almost instantly. It took a solid year for my skin to become completely clear. I still get the occasional pimple, but am happy to say my chronic cystic acne journey is now over, and the carnivore 100% healed it, zero question. My weight is back up, not where it used to be (because I was shoving +500g of carbs down my throat a day), but I like where I’m at. Mental health is better than ever as well.

I predominantly ate 85/15 grass-fed ground beef during that time (occasionally raw dairy, eggs, and bacon). I now eat 85/15 grass-fed ground beef, grass-fed tallow, pasture-raised eggs, and some raw honey. I never cheat, it’s not worth it. I tried 'Animal-Based' with fruits, but my gut still doesn't agree with any plant matter whatsoever. I even tried to introduce the 'easiest to digest' carbs like white rice and potato multiple times with no luck.

My skincare is super basic - I only use dead sea salts to shower with (I put like ¼ cup into a large cup and pour it over my head). No soap or cleanser touches my face, neck, or hair, just water and salt. My oil production is perfect now. I live in a dry climate and had to use the strongest moisturizers to combat my dry flaking skin; I literally don’t use anything anymore (sometimes tallow on my hands).

After 6 years of misery and thousands of dollars down the drain… meat was the answer all along! While my skin is healed, my gut still has some work to do, but it gets better every day.",My Acne Healing Story - Vegan vs Carnivore,t2_9ge92ehz,0.99,681,1716387848.0,1716387848.0,263,wolfgangwolff,1cy1i23

carnivorediet,"Hi! First time poster here, I wanna thank you all for this sub. I started this diet on June 11th. Previously had tried CICO and just wasn’t losing weight. I had been measuring and counting everything (from my research this might be due to insulin resistance). I struggle with Binge Eating Disorder so with CICO I was constantly starving. 
I was then diagnosed as pre-diabetic.  
I chose to do keto for a while but there was too many carby temptations and I still felt like I was over eating. 
So I went full Carnivore and haven’t looked back. I’m never hungry anymore. I mostly eat beef and eggs but I have chicken twice a week. 
I made this post because I can’t believe how much easier my life is because of this diet. I think this has been the easiest way I’ve ever lost weight. I don’t work out much either I just go on short walks. But I will be starting to go to a gym.
I do believe this diet has helped me with Binge Eating because my biggest trigger was hunger itself and unnecessary snacking. I will continue on this diet for as long as I can.

carnivorediet,"

Another month in, wanted to give an update!

I am doing strict lion diet (only beef, lamb, salt, water) to heal rheumatoid arthritis. I did a much more detailed post a month ago in r/carnivore so you can check that if you want more context.

I love seeing the other women share their progress photos here (the men too, it’s just fun to see other women in a space that has so many men!) so I thought I’d share mine too.

I am down about 23 lbs and the main thing I notice is that I was holding so much water and puffiness - the difference in my face is huge.

I am still tapering off prednisone, at 5 mg at this point and didn’t feel any worse from the drop from 7.5 to 5 so I’m hopeful the rest of the way off will be pretty smooth. I’ve been breaking out a LOT but I am pretty sure it is from the prednisone (a steroid) and not the diet so we will see.

My digestion has improved! A month ago I had posted I was still having diarrhea mostly every day. Now I am having mostly solid poops with occasional diarrhea. I did take a break from salt and backed off on fat for a week or two but I’m not convinced that did it because I’ve added some salt and the fat back again - it feels more likely that my gut is just finally adjusting.

I can’t really tell if salt makes a difference for me in any way or not, I seem to feel pretty similar whether I add it or not - however now that I took a break I don’t want as much as I was using in the beginning so maybe that is a factor.

I’m not convinced I’m eating enough food as my hunger has calmed down quite a bit and I’m probably only eating around 1-1.5 lbs of fatty meat a day plus broth. But I’m hesitant to change anything yet because it seems like it’s good for my inflammation that I’m losing weight, I’m still increasing strength at the gym, and my energy has stayed the same. Another 10-15 lbs down and I might try to increase it.

My right leg looks a little weird because I have swelling in my knee from the RA and muscle wasting along with it, that has stayed the same.

I’d love for my sleep to be better as I have pretty restless sleep but that is the same as before carnivore and could also be affected by the prednisone.

I’m 5’3” and went from 179-156 lbs for context.

I haven’t had much change in joint pain (my right elbow, right knee, both wrists and both feet are most affected) but I think it will take getting off the pred to see if the diet will heal my gut and I start to feel better. I have seen enough benefit though to feel encouraged which I listed in my other posts.

Super excited to see how the next couple months go, I’ve received so much from reading different threads on Reddit so just wanted to share in case anyone can benefit!

I’ve been carnivore for 5+ years (keto for 15 years). I wanted to bust the myth that we need carbs for energy. In September 2023 I completed 5 marathons in 5 days completely fasted. Nothing but water and salt for 5 days.

The key was to strictly adhere to a carnivore diet and make my metabolism become fat adapted. This unlocked 50x more energy than if I relied on carbs. 

I can vouch for the fact that on carnivore, your energy levels will skyrocket!

carnivorediet,"Today marks my 7th year since I began a zero-carb journey, inspired by Dr Jason Fung's insights after countless attempts with various diets and exercise regimes fell short. My quest for weight loss led me through the digital corridors of Google, where I stumbled upon a forum discussion that changed my life.

Since adopting the ketogenic lifestyle on January 3, 2018, I've not only shed over 40 kilograms of fat but have also built significant muscle mass. This transformation wasn't just physical; it was holistic. Over these years, I've immersed myself in health literature and educational videos from leading experts in the field.

This dietary shift has been my panacea for numerous health ailments:

    • Allergies: No longer does milk protein trigger adverse reactions.
    
    • Digestive Health: Gone are the days of bloating, gas, and GERD/acid reflux.
    
    • Pain Relief: My back and knee pain are gone.
    
    • Respiratory Ease: Snoring and heavy breathing are things of the past.
    
    • Energy: Low energy levels are now a distant memory.

My regimen includes a diet rich in animal-based proteins, complemented by intermittent fasting for at least 16 hours daily. This approach has not only worked for me but also for my parents, who are nearing their 7-year milestone this August.

As I approach my 56th birthday in a month, I see no reason to abandon this lifestyle. It's not just about living; it's about thriving with energy and vitality.

As someone who loves food, my journey proves that if I can do it, so can you.

carnivorediet,"With the price of meat being what it is, most of my diet consists of minced meat. Rolling ground beef patties and cleaning the kitchen from a crazy amount of grease from frying the patties every few days is starting to feel a bit old, so today I figured out how to make a lazy carnivore's ground beef patties.  😁 

I got two baking trays on which I patted out four kilos of minced meat, I cut the meat into 100 gram squares with a pizza cutter, and then I cooked both trays in a convection oven at 225 °C for 20-25 minutes. Voilà! 8 days of food in half an hour! (I usually also add scrambled eggs to my meal but that's very quick so no need to do in advance.)

I already had a meat stew for the next few days cooking in the slow cooker (it was a cheap electricity day 😃) and I live a hectic life, so when the patties came out of the oven, I bagged them into one day portions (I'm on OMAD) and put them all in the freezer. Now when I have one of those crazy days when I get home too late to start cooking, I can just take my meal straight from the freezer and heat it up while frying my eggs, and dinner is served!

carnivorediet,"
In Mongolia, eating primarily meat isn’t just a trend—it’s deeply tied to our nomadic heritage and the demands of our environment. Our ancestors thrived on a high-protein, high-fat diet to endure harsh winters, and even today, we adapt our diet based on the seasons and what our bodies need.

I want to emphasize that you don’t need to cut all greens or herbs entirely. Good herbs to season meat and soups, especially during winter and spring, are essential. Bone broth is highly recommended to stay strong and nourished in the cold.

Our meat choices also change with the seasons:
	•	In summer or warmer weather, we eat lighter meats like goat, chicken, or fish.
	•	During the harsh winters (-40°C), we rely on horse meat (sorry, it’s part of our culture) and beef for warmth and energy.
	•	In the sensitive season of spring, when the body and emotions feel more fragile, we prefer lamb or dried meat (called “borts”) for balance.

Dairy fat is also a crucial part of our diet. While we avoid overdosing on dairy, we consume natural yogurt and unsweetened milk tea with a pinch of lake salt for calcium and vitamin D.

For us, the carnivore diet isn’t a rigid restriction but a seasonal, culturally adapted way of eating. It reflects not just survival, but also a deep connection with nature and what our bodies truly need.

carnivorediet,"My Journey with the Carnivore Diet + fasting

In April, I realized I had let myself go. Despite trying to maintain a balanced diet for a few months, this so-called “healthy” lifestyle wasn’t doing me any good. I experienced constant fatigue, worsening IBS, and just felt a general sense of ‘meh’ about life. I had tried the carnivore diet twice before, in 2022 and 2023. In 2022, I did a ‘dirty’ version of carnivore with loads of cheese, seasonings, and milk. In 2023, I stuck with it for about a month and saw great benefits, but I found it hard to maintain.

By this April, I was fed up. I started with a 30-day dopamine detox on April 22, 2024.

On May 13, 2024, I attempted a 22-day water fast. I say “attempted” because it was essentially a fat fast for the first 20 days, with a strict water-only fast on the last two days. I had coffee with milk and butter every day, and my weight and measurements didn’t change much until I cut out the milk, so it felt like a bit of a waste of time. I also felt super crappy during most of the fast, likely because the milk kept me from entering full ketosis. The longest fast I’d done before was in May 2023, where I completed a clean, 21-day water-only fast and saw incredible benefits after day 5. But this year’s fast allowed me to push myself enough to kick off my weight loss.

I quit dairy on the 20th day of my fast and prepared to go into the carnivore diet, focusing on beef, butter, bacon, eggs, and black coffee. I never liked black coffee before, but now it’s my favorite thing.

I officially started carnivore on June 4th, but I tell people May, since I was fat fasting.

On July 18, 2024, I tried an animal-based diet, but it didn’t work well with my IBS. However, I was on a tropical island, so it felt right, lol. I fell off the carnivore diet completely after 6 days of eating fruit, cheese, and meat. I caved at a relative’s house, where I was pushed into having champagne and fast food, leading to 5 days of eating all kinds of sweets. So, I was basically off carnivore for 10 days.

On July 29, 2024, I picked up where I left off, mainly because I missed the mental clarity. In just three days, I felt better, which was insane—my mood was stable, and my energy levels were phenomenal.

By August 16, 2024, I had tricked myself into thinking I could jump on and off this diet. With a bachelorette party coming up in Italy, I caved, telling myself I’d get back on track when I returned home. It took me 16 days to do so, but the gelato, sandwiches, and pasta were totally worth experiencing in Italy. It’s just hard to break the addiction once I’m back home. I was only in Italy for four days, so my cheat days shouldn’t have lasted longer than that. But I don’t beat myself up for it—I know that’s not the right tactic. I’m just happy I found my way back.

On September 1, 2024, I made a conscious effort to return to the carnivore diet, and now I’m back to eating bacon, beef, butter, eggs, coffee, and a little bit of heavy whipping cream.

Benefits


* IBS is almost non-existent
* Fat and water loss
* Better dental hygiene
* Super smooth skin
* High libido
* Waking up excited and happy
* Feeling a childlike sense of joy about life
* No fatigue after workouts
* Brighter, more awake eyes
* No puffiness in my face
* No aches of any kind (body/head)

Cons

* I’ve had some reflux issues with this way of eating (WOE). I started taking omeprazole, but I’m hoping it will fade as I get more used to digesting the amount of fat I’m consuming.
* I also had some sleep issues during the first month, waking up super early and not feeling like I got quality sleep.

I don’t know if this diet is for everyone, and I’m open to being proven wrong. If I could, I’d love to include other foods in my diet, but as the saying goes, “nothing feels as good as healthy feels.” I don’t want to be dogmatic—I used to be vegan, so I know all about preaching and trying to convince people of things I hadn’t fully researched myself. All I know is that no diet has ever made me feel as good as the carnivore diet has, and I’ve tried sooo many diets and exercises for months at a time. But hey, here’s my story so far. I might change in the future, who knows? All I know is that I’m excited to be here and excited to continue with this WOE.

Sorry for the long post!!

TL;DR

After struggling with fatigue, IBS, and general dissatisfaction with a “balanced” diet, I turned to the carnivore diet in April 2024. Despite a few previous attempts and some setbacks, including a 22-day fat fast and occasional cheating during trips, I found that this diet significantly improved my mental clarity, energy levels, and overall well-being. I quit dairy and focused on eating beef, butter, bacon, eggs, and black coffee.

Benefits:
* Improved IBS
* Weight and water loss
* Better skin, dental health, and mood
* High energy and stable mood

Cons:
* Initial reflux and sleep issues

All of a sudden she starts baking cakes!

She hasn't done baking in over 3 years. 

Rant over! 

I guess I'm trying to see if other people's partners are supportive?

I started the Carnivore diet at 265 in Feb, it’s been a journey trying many different ways to drop weight. Cutting out sodas helped initially, but 265 was still too heavy for my height.

Right before I got pregnant I was in the BEST shape of my life, working with an online coach in the gym and on a strict diet of chicken and veggies and protein shakes. After giving birth I went into a bad mentality of desperately wanting to lose weight and just started starving myself, which did the opposite to my body and I started putting on more weight. After my second child I saw a doctor who said all my blood work was fine (I was convinced there was something wrong internally) and gave me the age old advice ""eat less, move more"". I continued to eat very little and go to the gym and walk and NOTHING was changing.

carnivorediet,"I’ve been SUPER CLEAN KETOVORE since I was 14 (I was diagnosed with food allergies/intolerances and autoimmune diseases).

As the years progressed, I cut more and more foods out of my life as I realized my body was rejecting them. 

For the last 5-6 years I’ve been eating animals, and spinach/butter lettuce and the occasional green beans or asparagus that came with an entree at a restaurant. 

I was still suffering from bloat despite almost all fiber was taken out of my diet (I don’t eat dairy either and haven’t since age 14), but I had a sneaking suspicion that SPINACH might be the culprit (and I won’t lie, I was eating a lot)…. 

So about 2.5 month ago I cut it out cold turkey… And 👀👀 I don’t think I have ever felt MORE CONFIDENT in my skin and on top of that, I lost about 4 pounds of “bloat weight” and have even more energy. Oh and I don’t feel like I’m going to throw up when I wake up in the morning (sometimes I’d feel this way).

carnivorediet,"I’ve been ketovore since I was 14 years old.
As I got older, I eliminated more and more not carnivore foods (vegetables— I 100% got rid of fruit, grains, etc at age 14). For the last 1-2 years I’ve been only eating spinach, butter lettuce and the occasional cup or green beans or asparagus if it’s mandatory I order a side at the restaurant. However, a month ago, I completely ditched spinach (I always had a sneaking suspicion it was doing more harm than good to me) and bam, my stomach FEELS AMAZING! As someone who always hides her stomach behind baggy shirts, doesn’t want to wear bikinis, etc. this is a pretty huge deal for me. I’ve suffered from Ulcerative Colitis for most of my life and I had my large intestine removed when I was 21… So I’m no stranger to bloating because of those issues but just taking out that spinach from my diet has substantially decreased my bloat on the daily… Even when I am going through PMS, my body doesn’t feel like it’s retaining as much fluid. For the first time basically ever, I actually feel VERY confident in the body I work so hard for (I work out daily, eat insanely clean, etc) and I’m so happy I finally don’t feel 5-6 months pregnant constantly!

I was diagnosed with schizophrenia since I was 18 or 19.

I've dropped out of university 3 times. Every year slowly I got worse and worse at keeping myself together. I tried working jobs as well, but I was not able to do it. I struggled to do anything, I was not even able to maintain my basic health and hygiene.

The doctors were no help. They only ever cared to prescribe me drugs.  I tried them for a short period, but  I eventually stopped as I felt that they did not fix whatever that was causing me to deteriorate.

It was not until I changed my diet, from eating whatever I wanted to trying out carnivore, that my life changed around.

Within a couple of weeks half of my symptoms and depression went away. And the longer I kept at it, the better I got.

Now, 8 months in, I feel like a completely different human being and healthier than ever.

I have the energy to do almost anything. And for the first time I kept a job long term! (6 months now!)

Unlike most people I see online, I have gained a considerable amount of weight on this diet.

I used to be very skinny, and I still am, but somehow 15lbs heavier? On average I gain about 1-2lbs in body weight every month, and I'm still going... I've grown a considerable amount of muscle since I started the diet that people now ask me if I work out. (I do not.)

Although my schizophrenia symptoms hasn't gone away completely, I feel much more capable as person. I have the life in me change things around for the better.

I am not going to go back to school. But I am self-studying now to become a full-time software developer.

I would like to thank the community and online doctors who talks about this diet openly. Without you guys, I wouldn't have gotten better and healed my body.
