m325oca,t3_1hijze1,1hijze1,Is it just me or is stuff on your plate that you can't eat a bit annoying?  If the meat was still inside the tail then OK but serving up the empty tail?  What do I need that for?,

m2zapwp,t3_1hijze1,1hijze1,"Full recipe: [https://servedwithrice.com/lobster-tails-garlic-butter-pasta/](https://servedwithrice.com/lobster-tails-garlic-butter-pasta/) 

**Ingredients (served 2):**

* 2x 0.5lbs lobster tails
* 150g dried pasta (I used Tagliatelle)
* 4 tbsp butter
* 1 tsp paprika
* Several cloves of garlic
* Salt, pepper and lemon juice to taste

**Instructions**

1. Preheat oven at 200C/400F, and bring a pot of water to boil.
2. Melt butter in a large skillet on low heat. Add garlic and stir occasionally, until fragrant.
3. Using a pair of kitchen shears, cut along the top shell of each lobster tail.
4. Carefully remove the meat from the shell, but leave it attached to the tail. Lift the meat through the cut you made, and lay it on top of the shell.
5. Brush butter from the skillet onto the lobster tails. Salt and pepper the lobster, then roast on the top rack for 10-12 minutes on 200C/420F.
6. While lobster is in the oven, boil pasta in salted water until al dente.
7. Once pasta is done, drain and add to the skillet with the remaining garlic butter. Toss to combine, along with a bit of reserved pasta water.
8. Assemble and serve.

Cheers!",

I had to finish out my summer there and it was torture—it was a family member’s store so I was stuck with it, not a normal situation at all, most people have more options. Everyone there was nice about it, but it was so isolating and being completely devoid of all other options entirely.

lp17nie,t3_1fpys0z,1fpys0z,"# Blog post: [Best Biscoff Cheesecake ](https://chefsbinge.com/best-biscoff-cheesecake-recipe/)

# For the Base:

* 250 g Biscoff biscuits - 1 packet
* 100 g butter

# For the Cheesecake Filling:

* 500 g cream cheese - Philadelphia recommended
* 200 g thick yogurt - sour yogurt preferred
* 150 g Biscoff spread
* 40 g caster sugar
* 2 large eggs
* 1 tsp vanilla bean paste - or 1 tbsp vanilla extract

# For the Topping:

* 170 g Biscoff spread
* 100 g crushed Biscoff biscuits - reserved from base
* 5 Biscoff biscuits - halved (for decoration)

# Instructions:

1. Line the bottom and sides of a 22cm (9-inch) cake tin with baking paper. Grease the paper so it stays in place.
2. Crush 250g of Biscoff biscuits using a food processor or rolling pin until fine crumbs form. Set aside 100g of crushed biscuits for the topping.
3. Melt 100g of butter in a small pan over low heat.
4. Mix the remaining 150g of crushed biscuits with the melted butter until combined. Press this mixture into the bottom of the prepared cake tin, creating an even layer. Refrigerate for 20 minutes to set.
5. Preheat the oven to 150°C (300°F) fan setting.
6. In a large bowl, whisk together the cream cheese, yogurt, Biscoff spread, and caster sugar until smooth. Be careful not to overmix.
7. Add the eggs and vanilla paste (or extract) to the mixture and stir gently until just combined.
8. Once the biscuit base is chilled, pour the cheesecake filling evenly over the top. Smooth it with a spatula
9. Place the cheesecake on the lowest oven shelf and bake for 50 minutes, or until the center is set but still slightly jiggly.
10. Remove the cheesecake from the oven and let it cool on a wire rack for 1 hour. Then, place it in the fridge to chill for at least 1 more hour
11. Once the cheesecake is fully chilled, melt 170g of Biscoff spread in the microwave for about 30 seconds, until it reaches a liquid consistency.
12. Pour the melted Biscoff spread over the top of the cheesecake, letting it drip down the sides for an elegant finish.
13. Sprinkle the reserved 100g of crushed Biscoff biscuits over the top.
14. Place the cheesecake back in the fridge for 15 minutes to set the topping.
15. Before serving, decorate each slice with a halved Biscoff biscuit. The cheesecake will stay fresh in the fridge for up to 3 days. Smacznego!

INGREDIENTS

•             4 ancho chile peppers dried, seeds removed

•             4 guajillo chile peppers dried, seeds removed

•             2 chiles de arbol optional for spice

•             7 garlic cloves minced

•             1 white onion roughly chopped

•             4 roma tomatoes roughly chopped

•             1 cinnamon stick

•             20 black peppercorn

•             1 tbsp chili powder

•             1 tbsp cumin

•             2 tbsp paprika

•             3½ lb beef chuck roast

•             1 cup water

•             2 bay leaves

•             3 tbsp vegetable oil

•             1½ lemons juiced

•             16 oz oaxaca cheese see notes for other variations

•             corn tortillas

•             3 limes juiced

  
  
INSTRUCTIONS

 

1. Cut chile tops off and remove the seeds with a knife or spoon.

2. In a food processor, combine chiles, garlic cloves, white onion, roma tomatoes, cinnamon stick, peppercorn, chili powder, cumin, and paprika.

3. Blend or pulse until ingredients are nearly smooth and well blended.

4. Place beef chuck roast in crock pot.

5. Pour in birria sauce mixture.

6. Add 1 cup water to the top.

7. Add in 2 bay leaves and 3 tablespoons vegetable oil.

8. Slow cook on low for 10 hours or until fork tender.

9. Shred meat in a bowl using two forks.

10. Add 1 cup birria sauce from the slow cooker to the bowl. Save the remaining sauce for later.

11. To prepare the tacos, add a corn tortilla to a medium hot skillet.

12. Birria tacos have a signature crispy shell. To achieve this, in a nonstick pan, oil the pan, lay down the tortilla, top it with shredded cheese, flip it, let it get nice and golden brown and crunchy. Top the upward facing side with shredded beef, cilantro, onion, and lime juice then fold it in half.

13. Pour slow cooker sauce into a bowl and serve tacos with sauce to dip it into.

A couple suggestions (if you don’t mind) : you should try dry toasting (or roasting in the oven) the tomatoes, onion, and garlic before adding them. Also, be sure to use a fatty piece of meat. You can also add some short ribs in there for extra fat. The fat is important because you should dip the corn tortillas in it before toasting (as opposed to using regular oil) that way you get more flavor, and that signature red crispy shell.

ljdgush,t3_1eyhyxi,1eyhyxi,"**Prep Time: 10 minutes**

**Cooking Time: 15 minutes**

**Ingredients (serves 2-3):**

* 400g gnocchi
* 2 raw chicken breast fillets
* 100ml single cream
* Milk
* 2 handfuls baby spinach
* 1 chicken stock cube
* 1 tbsp dried sage
* 1 tbsp dried oregano
* 1 tsp dried chilli flakes
* White pepper
* Garlic paste
* 1 tbsp olive oil
* 1 tbsp grated Parmesan
* Hot water to hand

**Directions**

1. Cut the chicken breast fillets into strips and then \~2cm cubes
2. Season the chicken generously with white pepper and plenty of garlic paste (15-20cm if squeezed from a tube)
3. Thoroughly mix the chicken and garlic paste and ideally set aside for 10-20 minutes to let it penetrate.
4. Add the oil to a wok or large non-stick pan and heat very strongly.
5. When the oil is almost smoking, make sure the whole pan is coated and add the chicken. **Do not stir or toss.** Instead, use tongs to reposition the pieces of chicken so that each is in contact with the pan.
6. Cook without stirring, checking the bottom of the chicken pieces until they are golden-brown.
7. Quickly toss the chicken to seal it on all sides (don't cook it through yet) and then remove from the pan with a slotted spoon, leaving any oil and juices behind. Put the chicken in a pan or bowl and cover.
8. Add a little more oil if the pan is dry, and reduce the heat to moderate (it's a good idea to lift the pan off for thirty seconds or so to let it cool to avoid scorching the spices)
9. Add the chilli flakes, oregano, and sage to the pan and heat for a few seconds until fragrant.
10. Crumble over the stock cube and add a splash of hot water.
11. Add the gnocchi, tossing and stirring thoroughly untill all the pieces are glazed.
12. Add the single cream and stir gently until the gnocchi starts to absorb the liquid and the mixture thickens.
13. Gradually add milk, continuing to stir, until the sauce resembles a creamy soup and is bubbling, and the gnocchi has almost fully cooked.
14. Add the chicken and spinach to the pan, stir thoroughly to coat all the spinach, and continue to cook. **Loosen the sauce with a little hot water as needed to keep it at a creamy soup consistency.**
15. Once the spinach has wilted and the chicken just cooked through, quickly add the grated parmesan, stir, and add a final splash of hot water if needed. The sauce will continue to thicken after serving, so err on the side of keeping it loose.
16. Serve immediately.

**Notes:**

The chicken is ready to serve when the chunks peel easily in two with a fork and the meat within is white, glossy, and steaming. It will quickly become chewy if left on the heat much beyond that point, so be ready to plate up!

If preparing a larger quantity, do the browning of the chicken in batches, and empty any liquid out of the pan into the bowl with the chicken between batches. If you try to cook too much at once, you'll get a lot of moisture buildup in the pan and the chicken will poach rather than browning. Once all the chicken is browned, tip the juices back into the pan with the spices and continue with the recipe.

You can prep and refrigerate the marinated raw chicken in advance for even more flavour.",

 I just made the most delicious Chicken Shawarma with homemade Laffa Bread, and I can't wait to share the recipe with you! Juicy, flavorful chicken, wrapped in soft laffa, topped with fresh veggies, tangy pickles, and a drizzle of garlic sauce... it’s seriously next-level.

# Ingredients for the Chicken Shawarma

* 650 g boneless - skinless chicken thighs
* Juice of half a lemon
* 3 garlic cloves - minced
* 1 tsp minced ginger
* 1 tbsp extra virgin olive oil - for the marinade
* Half of the Lebanese spice blend
* Iceberg lettuce - shredded
* Cherry tomatoes - quartered
* Cucumber - halved and sliced
* Pickled element of the salad - lacto-fermented cucumbers or red sauerkraut
* Toum - Lebanese garlic sauce made of yoghurt, garlic, olive oil, and lemon juice
* Chilli sauce
* Optional: Drizzle of tahini sauce or a sprinkle of sumac for extra flavor

# How to Prepare Chicken Shawarma:

1. Prepare the chicken thighs by cutting each thigh into halves. Marinate the meat in a bowl with half the Lebanese spice blend, 1 tbsp extra virgin olive oil, lemon juice, minced garlic, and ginger. Allow the meat to marinate in the refrigerator for at least **2 hours or overnight (up to 24 hours for optimal flavor)**.
2. Oven Cooking: Skewer the marinated meat onto metal skewers and place them in a roasting dish. Preheat the oven to **250°C**. Grill the skewers for **10-12 minutes**, turning once halfway, until the meat is charred and cooked through.
3. Alternative Cooking Method: If you don’t have an oven or grill, you can cook the chicken in a cast-iron skillet on medium-high heat. Heat 1 tbsp of olive oil in the skillet and cook the chicken pieces in batches until well-charred and cooked through **(about 6-8 minutes per side)**. This method replicates the smoky effect of grilling.
4. Once the meat is fully cooked, remove it from the oven or skillet, take it off the skewers, and shred it with a knife.
5. Build your shawarma by layering the flatbread with meat juices, salad, shredded chicken, and sauces. For extra flavor, drizzle with tahini sauce or sprinkle sumac. Wrap it up, and for an authentic experience, use paper and tin foil.

lq4ttir,t3_1fv6m8g,1fv6m8g,"Ingredients (for about 3 - 5 servings):

• 1tbs of extra virgin olive oil (if you have EVOO with truffles it's even better!)   
• 2tbs of butter   
• 1 white onion   
• 1 carrot   
• 1 cup of celery   
• 450g / 1 pound of minced meat (I used 200g of ground pork to 250g of ground beef)  
• 1 cup / 240ml of milk   
• 1 cup / 240ml of dry white wine   
• 1 and ½ cup of canned tomato (basically one can)   
• Zest of sicilian lemon   
• Black pepper   
• Salt   
• Lots of water   
• Freshly grated cheese (parmesan or grana padano)

Preparation method:

1. Place the olive oil and the butter in a pan and wait for them to melt and heat up.

2. Add the chopped onion in a pot and turn on medium heat. Cook and stir the onion until it becomes translucent, then add the chopped celery and carrot. Season them with salt and pepper. Cook for about 2 minutes, stirring the vegetables to coat them well.

3. Add the ground meat, a generous pinch of salt, and pepper. Break up the meat with a fork, stir well, and cook until the meat loses its raw red color.

4. Add the milk and let it simmer gently, stirring constantly, until it has completely bubbled away.Add the peeled lemon zests, and stir.

5. Add the wine, let it boil until evaporated completely (it will take about 20 to 30 minutes). Taste it and season it as needed.

6. Add the tomatoes and stir well to coat all the ingredients. Taste it and season as needed.

7. When the tomatoes start bubbling, reduce the heat as much as possible to let the sauce cook slowly, with only an intermittent bubble rising to the surface.

8. Cook, uncovered, for 3 hours or more (6 hours for maximum flavor), stirring occasionally. Check it every 20-30 minutes. As the sauce cooks, you will likely notice it starting to dry out and the fat separating from the meat. To prevent sticking, add ½ cup of water whenever necessary.

9. In the end, however, there should be no water left, and the fat should separate from the sauce. Stir to mix the fat into the sauce, taste, and season it.

10. Add a ladle of the pasta cooking water if you want it to be more saucy. Add the cooked pasta into the bolognese pot and mix it so the sauce completely coats the pasta.

11. Serve with grated cheese and enjoy the best bolognese ever!",

m8c0g3b,t3_1i6gqec,1i6gqec,"# Ingredients for the Bread:

* 100 g Plain flour
* 1 tsp Baking powder
* 1 tsp Sugar
* 1/4 tsp Salt
* 1/4 tsp Black pepper
* 1 Large egg
* 50 ml Milk
* 1 tsp Butter - (for greasing the pan)

# Topping Ingredients:

* 4 Chipolata sausages - (cooked) I used Cumberland type cut in half.
* 2 Eggs
* 1 Large Tomato - thickly sliced
* 2 slices Streaky Unsmoked Bacon - sliced
* 50 g Cheddar Cheese - grated
* Black pepper - to your taste
* Oregano - for garnish
* Brown sauce - or any other sauce that you like

# Instructions:

1. Set your oven to **200°C (392°F)**. While it heats, grease your cast iron pan with butter to prevent sticking.
2. In a mixing bowl, combine the dry bread ingredients: self-rising flour, baking powder, sugar, salt, and black pepper. Whisk in the milk and egg until you have a smooth batter.
3. Spread the batter evenly in your greased pan. Arrange the toppings in the following order:– Crack the eggs onto the batter.– Add the cooked sausage halves.– Place the tomato slices.– Scatter the bacon pieces on top.– Fill any gaps with grated cheddar cheese.– Sprinkle with extra black pepper for that final kick.
4. If using a cast iron pan, heat the bottom on the stove for one minute to give the bread a head start. Then, transfer it to the oven and bake for **13–14 minutes** or until the bread is golden, the eggs are set, and the toppings are bubbling.
5. Remove the pan from the oven and garnish with fresh oregano. Drizzle with brown sauce for that unmistakable English breakfast flavor. Serve immediately, though I found it tastes just as delightful cold!

kqdypt7,t3_1aqns77,1aqns77,"Everybody loves spring rolls! There are many different varieties in Vietnam (and Asia) ranging from deep-fried to steamed or fresh using all kinds of wrappers. I will show you how to make these easy, fast, and healthy fresh spring rolls.

Full recipe with instruction video on how to roll these Vietnamese spring rolls: [https://misterspiceguy.com/recipe/fresh-vietnamese-spring-rolls](https://misterspiceguy.com/recipe/fresh-vietnamese-spring-rolls)

**Ingredients:**

* 6 sheets rice-paper
* 50 gram rice vermicelli
* 12 large shrimps
* 6 large lettuce leafs
* 50 gram cucumber, sliced in strips
* 1 carrot, julienne strips
* 15 gram mint leafs
* 15 gram cilantro
* optional: 10 gram thai basil

**sauce option 1:**

* 2 tbsp hoisin
* 2 tbsp peanut butter
* 1.5 tbsp thick coconut milk

**sauce option 2:**

* 2 tbsp fish sauce
* 2 tbsp water
* 1 tbsp of (palm) sugar
* 2 tbsp lime juice
* 1 finely diced red chili
* ½ clove finely chopped garlic

**Directions:**

1. Start with prepping all your ingredients. So wash your lettuce, cut your cucumber, julienne your carrot and cook the rice vermicelli noodles according to the package instructions. rinse under cold water and set all the ingredients to the side. Now it is time to boil your shrimp in soft boiling water for two minutes, then immediately cool them down in some ice water. I also like to cut them from tail to head down the middle, so you have a more even dispersion and this looks more beautiful in the end result. This is also the time to prepare your dipping sauce(s). For both recipes you only have to combine all the ingredients together!
2. Now it's time to roll! Start by soaking a rice wrapper in cold water for maximum 10 seconds and lay down on a flat and clean surface. Add your filling on top of the wrapper with enough space to the borders and start closing up your spring roll (you can find an [instruction video here](https://www.misterspiceguy.com/recipes/fresh-vietnamese-spring-rolls)). Finish all of them and serve them with you favorite dipping sauce. Enjoy!",

Pan-Seared Duck Breast with Carrot Puree, Long Stem Broccoli, Thousand-Layer Potatoes, and Honey Mustard Sauce

Ingredients

For the Duck Breast and Honey Mustard Sauce:

	•	2 duck breasts, skin scored
	•	Salt and pepper to taste
	•	2 tbsp Dijon mustard
	•	2 tbsp honey
	•	50 ml chicken stock

For the Carrot Puree:

	•	300g carrots, peeled and sliced
	•	200 ml vegetable stock or water (to boil carrots)
	•	30 ml heavy cream
	•	1 small pinch of nutmeg (optional)
	•	Salt and pepper to taste

For the Thousand-Layer Potatoes:

	•	500g red potatoes, peeled and thinly sliced
	•	100 ml melted goose fat (or duck fat)
	•	Salt to taste
	•	Small baking pan (approximately 15cm x 15cm)

For the Long Stem Broccoli:

	•	200g long-stem broccoli
	•	Olive oil for drizzling
	•	Salt and pepper to taste

Preparation Steps

1. Prepare the Thousand-Layer Potatoes (the day before):

	•	Preheat oven to 135°C (275°F).
	•	Layer the sliced potatoes in a baking pan, brushing each layer with goose fat and lightly salting.
	•	Cover with foil and bake for 2.5 hours until tender.
	•	Once out of the oven, place another pan on top and weigh it down to press the potatoes.
	•	Refrigerate overnight to set. On the day of serving, cut into 2 large rectangular pieces for each plate.

2. Prepare the Carrot Puree:

	•	Boil carrots in stock or water until tender (about 15 minutes).
	•	Drain and transfer carrots to a blender, adding cream and seasoning with salt, pepper, and a pinch of nutmeg.
	•	Blend until smooth, adjusting seasoning if necessary. Set aside and reheat gently before serving.

3. Sear the Duck Breast:

	•	Pat the duck breasts dry, score the skin, and season with salt and pepper.
	•	Heat a pan over medium heat. Place duck breasts skin-side down, allowing the fat to render and skin to crisp (about 6-8 minutes).
	•	Flip and cook for an additional 3-4 minutes, or until desired doneness.
	•	Rest duck for 5 minutes before slicing.

4. Make the Honey Mustard Sauce:

	•	Remove any excess fat from the duck pan, leaving about 1 tbsp.
	•	Add Dijon mustard, honey, and chicken stock, simmering gently until thickened. Adjust seasoning to taste.

5. Cook the Long Stem Broccoli:

	•	Blanch broccoli in boiling water for 2-3 minutes until tender-crisp. Drain and drizzle lightly with olive oil, seasoning with salt and pepper.

6. Finish the Thousand-Layer Potatoes:

	•	Cut the chilled potato block into serving-sized rectangles.
	•	Pan-fry in a little goose fat over medium-high heat until golden and crispy on each side.

Plating

	1.	Place a portion of carrot puree on each plate, spreading gently.
	2.	Arrange sliced duck breast atop the puree.
	3.	Add the crispy thousand-layer potato piece alongside the duck.
	4.	Place the broccoli next to the other elements.
	5.	Drizzle honey mustard sauce over the duck and serve immediately.",

And it was obvious what she'd done wrong: she rolled the dough out so thin that it would create a giant air pocket in the center. Meanwhile, the beignets served at the cafe itself were soft and pillowy and a bit chewy.

ldiigo6,t1_ldfosrm,1e4mcer,What do you recommend this with?,
ldiw1pr,t1_ldhm55p,1e4mcer,"Basmati is recommended for Persian rice.  At the very least it should be a long grain non sticky rice.

I personally always hated when my parents made this bc I dislike dill, but the rest of my family seemed to find it delicious.  My parents used to also add lima beans to dill rice to make Baghali Polo.

The only issue with op's version is the cook time is low, probably why the pictures in the link look like a sticky mess, either that or they didn't rinse the starch.  You normally steam basmati rice for much longer than 8 minutes.  The grains should be individually separated on their own, which is why you need long grain rice.  In the pictures on the website they clearly are not.

[This video](https://youtu.be/trsOyRIJmpA?si=g4OyaD2fZuwVVoLTis) plus his companion video on Persian rice is the correct way to make the dish, omit the beans if u wish to just make rice.",

llda225,t3_1f85c99,1f85c99,"INGREDIENTS:

**FOR THE LAMB:**

* 900 g lamb shoulder or leg - cut into chunks

* 40 ml olive oil

* 160 g onion - finely chopped

* 15 g garlic - minced

* 12 g fresh ginger - grated

* 1 teaspoon ground cumin

* 1 teaspoon ground coriander

* 1 teaspoon ground cinnamon

* 1 teaspoon ground turmeric

* 1 teaspoon paprika

* 1/2 teaspoon ground black pepper

* 1/2 teaspoon ground cayenne pepper - optional, for heat

* Salt to taste

**FOR THE TAGINE:**

* 250 g tomatoes - chopped (or canned diced tomatoes)

* 110 g dried dates - diced

* 60 g raisins

* 150 g tinned apricots - (if using tinned apricots, add the juice as well) (if using fresh apricots – pitted and quartered)

* 300 g new potatoes - halved or quartered if large

* 450 ml vegetable or chicken broth

* 22 g honey

* 1 cinnamon stick

* 2 bay leaves

* Zest of 1/2 lemon

* Fresh cilantro and parsley - chopped, for garnish

**Instructions:**

1. In a bowl, combine the lamb chunks with ground cumin, coriander, cinnamon, turmeric, paprika, black pepper, cayenne (if using), and salt. Mix well to coat the lamb evenly. Let the lamb marinate for at least 30 minutes (or overnight in the refrigerator for deeper flavor).

2. Heat the olive oil in a tagine or heavy-bottomed pot over medium heat. Add the onions and sauté until soft and translucent, about 5 minutes. Add the garlic and ginger and cook for another 1-2 minutes until fragrant.

3. Add the marinated lamb chunks to the pot and brown them on all sides, about 5-7 minutes.

4. Add chopped tomatoes, diced dates, raisins, broth, honey, cinnamon stick, bay leaves, and lemon zest to the pot. Stir well to combine, and bring to a boil.

5. Reduce the heat to low, cover, and simmer for about 1 hour, or until the lamb is beginning to tenderize and flavors are melding.

6. After 1 hour of simmering, add the new potatoes to the pot. Continue to simmer for an additional 30-40 minutes, or until the potatoes are tender and the lamb is fully cooked.

7. About 10-15 minutes before the end of the cooking time, gently stir in the tinned apricots (or fresh apricots, if using). Allow them to warm through and absorb the flavors of the dish.

8. Adjust seasoning with salt and pepper as needed.

9. Garnish with chopped fresh cilantro and parsley. Serve hot with couscous, rice, or crusty bread.",

**Ingredients**

* 2 ½ cups all-purpose flour
* 1 cup (2 sticks) unsalted butter
* 1 cup dark brown sugar packed
* ½ cup granulated sugar
* 2 large eggs cold
* ½ tablespoon vanilla extract
* 1 teaspoon salt
* 1 teaspoon baking soda
* ½ teaspoon baking powder
* 1 cup chocolate chips I like semisweet
* Finishing flake salt optional

**Instructions**

1. Preheat oven to 350℉. In a medium bowl, whisk together flour, salt, baking soda, and baking powder until well combined.
2. In a large skillet over medium heat, add butter. Butter will melt and then brown in 5-15 minutes (very dependent on the brand of butter so watch carefully). Once you start to smell and see brown butter begin to form, swirl the butter around in the pan for even browning. Brown butter is ready when it’s nut/mahogany brown.
3. Immediately pour the butter into a large heat-safe bowl, scraping down the pan to scoop out any brown bits. Add the granulated and dark brown sugars. Stir.
4. Let brown butter and sugar mixture cool for 10 minutes.
5. Add cold eggs and vanilla extract. Mix well.
6. Add the flour mixture to the butter mixture. Stir until just combined.
7. Fold in chocolate chips. Dough will be very soft and malleable.
8. While you can chill your dough for up to an hour, there is absolutely no need to (I actually like the cookies just as much or more without chilling the dough). Scoop 2 tablespoon-sized balls on a parchment-lined or greased baking sheet about 2 inches apart. Tip: keep bowl with dough in the fridge between batches.
9. Bake cookies for 10-14 minutes until they are just set in the middle and light golden around the edges. Don’t over-bake!
10. Sprinkle with flake salt if desired. Let cool for 5 minutes on the baking sheet before transferring to a wire rack to cool completely or enjoying warm! Repeat for other batches.",

lcapcbc,t1_l8vk570,1de95ae,"Whipped butter IS butter.  You can even make it yourself.

# Dough

* Pour the warm milk into a bowl, sprinkle in the yeast and whisk together. Cover with plastic wrap and leave in a warm place for about 15 minutes to become bubbly and active.
* Pour into the bowl of a stand mixer fitted with a dough hook. Start the machine and add the cooled, melted butter. Allow to combine with the yeast for 1 minute, then add the sugar.
* In a separate bowl, weight about 400g of flour, add the cardamom and salt and mix together. Start adding the flour into the milk mixture, a few spoonfuls at a time.
* Add the beaten egg. Keep kneading for 5 minutes. You may need to add more flour, you want the dough to be a bit sticky, but not so much that it sticks to your finger if you poke it. Once mixed, leave the dough in a bowl and cover the a dish towel. Leave to rise for around 30 minutes or until its doubled in size.

# Pastry Cream

* In a saucepan, heat the milk with vanilla.
* In a separate bowl, whisk together the egg and sugar then add the cornstarch.
* When the milk has just reached the boiling point, take off the heat and pour 1/3 into the egg mixture while whisking continuously.
* Once whisked through, pour the egg mixture back into the remaining hot milk. Return to the stove and bring to a gentle boil. Whisk continuously as the mixture thickens, for just a minute. Remove from heat and stir in the salt and butter.
* Pour into a cold bowl and place a sheet of parchment on top to prevent the cream form forming a crust as it cools.

# Skoleboller

* Preheat oven to 350 F.
* Dust your work surface with flour and turn out the dough. Knead the dough with your hands and work in more flour if needed. Cut the dough into 12 equal sized pieces. Roll out so the buns are uniform in size and place on a prepared baking sheet, well spaced out as they'll grow.
* Leave for 10 minutes to rest, then prod a large hole in the middle of each and flatten slightly. Hole should be around 1.5 inches in diameter.
* Add a large tablespoon of pastry cream to each bun. Leave for 15 minutes to rise, then brush sides of the buns with the beaten egg.
* Bake in the preheated oven for 10-12 minutes.
* When the buns have cooled slightly, make the icing by mixing the icing sugar with a little hot water until you have a syrup like consistency.
* Use a pastry brush to brush the icing around the edges of the buns, then sprinkle the edges of the buns with shredded coconut.
* Leave to set before serving.",

lmta1dy,t3_1ffax6j,1ffax6j,"# Ingredients:

* Ready-made puff pastry — 400 g (14 ounces)
* Apple — 3 pcs (use juicy, crunchy, sweet apples!)
* Cinnamon — ½ tsp
* Cane sugar — 4 tbsp
* Cornstarch — 1 tsp
* Water — 1 tbsp
* Egg yolk — 1 pcs

# How to cook:

1. Defrost the puff pastry beforehand. Wash and dice the apples.
2. Place the apples in a saucepan with 3 tablespoons of sugar and half a teaspoon of cinnamon.
3. Place the pan over medium heat and cook for a few minutes, stirring constantly, until the sugar has dissolved. Stir the cornstarch into a small amount of cold water until smooth and add to the apples.
4. Stir well and cook the apples for a few minutes until the juice has thickened (the whole mixture should be sticky). Then remove from the heat and let the apples rest.
5. Sprinkle the thawed dough with a little flour and roll out to about 0.5 cm (0.2 inches) thick. Then cut out circles (I used a glass and a knife to do this).I had 2 sheets of ready-made puff pastry which made 16 circles (I also used the leftover dough after cutting). It is important that you get an even number of dough circles.
6. Make small snowflake-shaped cuts on half of the dough circles (watch how I do it in the video).
7. Spread 1 tablespoon of the apple filling on each of the remaining circles (the ones without the cuts). Cover with a circle of the scored dough, pressing the edges together a little with your fingers and then running a fork around the circle to create a nice scalloped edge.
8. Brush the puffs with egg yolk and sprinkle with a little cane sugar (this will make the crust more golden).
9. Put the puffs in a preheated oven at 175°C (350°F) for 15-20 minutes (convection mode). After that, take the puffs out of the oven and let them cool down. Enjoy!

lmuplgs,t3_1ffax6j,1ffax6j,Wow! Question. Where can I buy ready made puff pastry?,
lmw9poy,t3_1ffax6j,1ffax6j,What spoon measures do.you use? I know there's something like a 5g difference between Australian and US tablespoon measures (but given the recipe using grams and Celcius I'm assuming you're not based in the US). Just wondering because it would work out as 80g sugar if I used my spoons but approx 60g if I weighed it out to US measurements so I'd be down a tablespoon of sugar.,
lmuow7s,t3_1ffax6j,1ffax6j,Yum,

Technically you can make your own puff pastry but unlike those other doughs mentioned, it's about a 4 hour labor intense process and you can usually buy the rolls for about 3-4 bucks.",

[Duck Breast with Blueberry Sauce video recipe](https://youtu.be/1bUmTi8jOYY)

Below is the text based recipe:

**Ingredients:**

• 1 Duck breast

• 1 Sweet Onion

• 2 Garlic Cloves

• 15g ginger

• 1 Granny smith apple

• 1 Orange

• 250g Fresh blueberries

• 35g brown sugar

• 18g sugar

• 1 Star anise

• 60g Red wine vinegar

• 1/4 tsp Salt

• 1/4 tsp Pepper

**Instructions:**

1. Place the duck skin side down in a cold pan
2. Turn the heat to medium-high to render the fat
3. Cook the duck breast for about 7 minutes per side
4. Remove the duck breast from the pan
5. Add onion and cook until it softens
6. Add garlic
7. Grate apple
8. Cook for 1 minute, then add the blueberries
9. Add orange zest
10. Add orange juice
11. Add ginger
12. Add 35g of brown sugar, 18g of sugar
13. Add star anise
14. Add 60g of red wine vinegar
15. Simmer until the sauce thickens
16. Slice the duck breast on an angle
17. Serve with sauce

**Tip:**

• Apples oxidize easily, so you can soak the peeled apples in water. Or, peel the apples while frying the onions to prevent the apples from oxidizing.

• Make sure to avoid the white part when you zest the orange.",

kqs3j8o,t1_kqq7vae,1amkgmq,"Please refer to my video guide as I showed how much zested orange I used in there definitely not the entire orange because it will be way too much and the sauce like you said will only taste like orange.

kpr1prl,t1_kpqvhix,1amkgmq,When you pan seared the duck breast you don’t need to add any oil. Because with the skin down you will render the fat just the skin alone. I can’t handle any fat as well. With the blueberry sauce it eliminated almost oily texture. Another option is to eat it without the skin.,

Once the shrimp par cook and you have a glaze to the bottom of the pan, add Chardonnay (it’s possible I’m wrong on what wine is used to deglaze) after the wine reduces you turn off the heat, add a fat glob of cold butter, and a fuckton of parmasan and the pasta with a little pasta water, and toss until it’s all well mixed and the pasta is held togeather by a thick butter/parmasan sauce.

Full recipe: [https://www.theflouredcamera.com/kung-pao-brussels-sprouts/](https://www.theflouredcamera.com/kung-pao-brussels-sprouts/) 

# Ingredients

* 2 lbs brussels sprouts
* 2 tablespoon olive oil

**Vinegar Mixture**

* ¼ cup Chinese black vinegar
* 2 tablespoon light soy sauce
* 2 tablespoon Shaoxing wine
* 3 tablespoon granulated sugar
* ¼ teaspoon salt
* 2 teaspoon cornstarch

**Kung Pao Sauce Base**

* 2 tablespoon vegetable oil
* 1 tablespoon white sesame seeds
* 1 teaspoon chili flakes
* 4 cloves garlic minced
* 1 tablespoon ginger minced
* 1 teaspoon Sichuan peppercorn ground

# Instructions

1. Cut the stems and halve brussels sprouts. Coat with olive oil and bake at 400 °F for 30 mins. At the 15 min mark, gently toss the brussels sprouts so they all bake evenly.
2. Mix Chinese black vinegar, light soy sauce, Shaoxing wine, granulated sugar, salt, and cornstarch in a bowl. Whisk so the cornstarch is mixed in evenly.
3. In a deep saucepan or wok, add vegetable oil, white sesame seeds and Chinese chili flakes. Fry on medium heat until the chili flakes brown a bit (but not black). This should take 1-2 minutes. If the oil starts to bubble, briefly take the wok off the heat.
4. Add minced garlic, minced ginger, and ground Sichuan peppercorn to the wok. If you have whole Sichuan peppercorn, ground with a mortar and pestle. Stir-fry for 30 seconds.
5. Add the vinegar mixture that you had set aside and set heat to medium-low. Stir until the mixture thickens enough to coat a spoon. It’ll thicken further as it cools.
6. Remove brussels sprouts out of the oven and add them to the wok with the sauce. Toss until brussels sprouts are evenly coated.",

li7j7w5,t3_1espvwd,1espvwd,"Cucumber season yields an abundance, so I’m turning my allotment cucumbers into kimchi!

# Ingredients for the Kimchi:

* 700 g Cucumbers - (pickling veriety)
* 14 g Salt - (2% of cucumber weight)
* 1 Medium-sized carrot - cut into 5cm julienne
* A handful of chives

# Ingredients for the Paste:

* 3 tbsp Gochugaru - (Korean chili flakes, use 2 tbsp for a milder version)
* 1.5 tbsp Minced garlic
* 2 tsp Minced ginger
* ½ Red Apple - grated
* 1.5 tbsp Honey - or sugar
* 1 tsp Minced Saeujeot - (Korean salted shrimp) (use more fish sauce if not available)
* 1 tsp Fish sauce - (use dark soy sauce for a vegan version)

# Instructions:

1. Start by trimming the ends of the cucumbers. Slice each cucumber in half lengthwise, then cut these halves into 5cm pieces. For added texture, you can further slice each segment into a triangular prism shape.
2. In a large mixing bowl, combine the cucumber segments with the julienned carrots and chives. Sprinkle the salt evenly over the vegetables, ensuring they are well-coated. This salting process draws out moisture, which is crucial for fermentation. Let the mixture rest for about **25 minutes**.
3. While the cucumbers are resting, prepare the spicy Gochugaru paste. In a separate bowl, mix the Gochugaru (Korean chili flakes), minced garlic, minced ginger, grated red apple, sugar or honey, minced Saeujeot (Korean salted shrimp), and fish sauce. Adjust the chili flakes if you prefer a milder taste. Stir until you achieve a consistent paste.
4. After the cucumbers have rested, gently squeeze out any excess moisture. Add the Gochugaru paste to the cucumber mixture, ensuring all pieces are evenly coated. Now, it's time to pack! You can use a traditional jar or opt for vacuum bags. Make sure to remove as much air as possible to promote proper fermentation.
5. Allow the packed kimchi to ferment at room temperature for approximately 2 days. You'll notice a slight tangy aroma, indicating the fermentation process is underway.After this period, transfer the kimchi to the refrigerator to halt fermentation and preserve the cucumber's crunch. While the cucumber kimchi is ready to enjoy immediately after chilling, its flavors will continue to develop over the next few days. Since cucumbers are more delicate than cabbage, it’s best to consume this kimchi while it retains its crispiness.

**Ingredients:**

* 2 cups cake flour
* 1 ½ cups fresh strawberries hulled and sliced
* 1 cup granulated sugar
* ½ cup (1 stick) unsalted butter softened
* ½ cup full-fat sour cream room temperature for 20 minutes
* 3 large eggs room temperature for 20 minutes
* ½ tablespoon vanilla extract
* ½ teaspoon baking soda
* ½ teaspoon salt

**Instructions:**

1. Preheat oven to 325℉. Grease a 9×5” pan. Set aside.
2. In the bowl of a mixer, beat butter, sugar, salt, and vanilla for 1 minute on medium speed. Do not over-beat.
3. Add one egg at a time, on low speed, until incorporated. Then add sour cream on low speed until incorporated, scraping down the sides of the bowl as needed.
4. Add baking soda and mix on low speed. Then add flour, and mix on low speed until just incorporated. Scrape down sides of the bowl as needed. Do not over-mix.
5. Use a spatula to fold in the strawberries, being careful to not over-mix.
6. Scoop batter into prepared baking pan. Bake for 1 hour and 15-30 minutes. If top of cake is browning too quickly, lay a piece of foil across the top of the cake. Cake is done when a toothpick comes out clean or with a few crumbs (not wet batter).

**Ingredients**

* 1 pound fresh tomatillos
* 1 small white onion peeled and quartered
* 1 jalapeño pepper halved and seeded
* ¼ cup roughly chopped fresh cilantro
* 1 large garlic clove peeled
* 1 tablespoon fresh lime juice
* Salt to taste

**Instructions**

1. Preheat oven to broil. If you have a high-broil setting, use that.
2. Remove the tomatillo husks, popping off any stems as well. Rinse the tomatillos thoroughly under running water to remove the sticky sap. Pat dry.
3. Place tomatillos and the halved jalapeño on a baking sheet. Prick each tomatillo twice with a fork.
4. Broil for 5 minutes. Use tongs to flip over the tomatillos and jalapeño halves.
5. Watching carefully, broil for another 3-6 minutes. The tomatillo skins should be lightly charred and should loosen a bit, just starting to fall apart.
6. Let cool for at least 10 minutes. While cooling, add onion, cilantro, garlic, and lime juice to a blender.
7. Add one or both of the jalapeño halves depending on your desired heat level. Add all of the tomatillos and any juice left on the pan.
8. Pulse blender, scraping down the sides as needed, until your desired consistency is reached. I like mine mostly smooth with fine chunks!
9. Stir in salt. Enjoy right away or chill in the refrigerator (recommended) before serving.",

l2z5m7n,t3_1cmbov7,1cmbov7,"[**Full Recipe and Video Here**](https://tastefullygrace.com/salmon-croquettes/)



**Ingredients**

* 1 pound fresh salmon fillet skinned
* ¾ cup panko breadcrumbs
* ½ medium red bell pepper finely chopped
* ¼ cup grated yellow onion see below for details
* 1 large garlic clove minced
* 1 large egg lightly beaten
* 1 tablespoon fresh chives finely chopped
* 1 tablespoon fresh Italian parsley finely chopped
* Salt and pepper to taste
* Vegetable or canola oil for frying
* Lemon wedges to serve



**Instructions**

1. Preheat oven to 450℉. Place salmon in a dry baking dish and bake for 14-18 minutes until the center starts to flake, or the internal temperature reaches 135-145℉.
2. While salmon is in the oven, grate a yellow onion with the coarse setting of a cheese grater. The grated onion will look like watery apple sauce. Add grated yellow onion, panko, bell pepper, garlic, egg, chives, parsley, and salt and pepper to a medium bowl.
3. When salmon is done, transfer to a plate and use two forks to shred salmon into little pieces. After it cools for a few minutes (so egg doesn’t scramble), add salmon to the bowl with other ingredients. Mix until well-combined.
4. Use a ¼ cup measure to make ¼ cup-sized balls, placing them on a large plate or baking sheet. You should be able to make roughly 11 balls.
5. Once the balls are formed, lightly push the balls down to make thick patties. Ensure the ingredients are tightly packed/squeezed together so the patties don’t fall apart.
6. Add ½ inch of oil to a large pan. Turn heat to medium-high and wait until the oil registers 325-350℉
7. Once the oil has reached temperature, very carefully slide croquettes into the pan (using a spatula), ensuring they don’t break apart. You can add as many as possible without overcrowding. Cook croquettes for 1-2 minutes per side until deep golden. If you turn the croquettes prematurely, they’ll fall apart.
8. Use a slotted spatula to remove the croquettes from the oil, placing on a paper towel lined plate. Sprinkle generously with salt.
9. Repeat until all croquettes are fried. Serve with lemon wedges.",

* 1000 ml water
* 5 g calcium chloride
* 200 ml water
* 20 g sugar (optional)
* 1 teaspoon natural lemon oil
* 1 g soy lecithin
* 1,5 g sodium alginate
* Yellow food coloring

# Directions

1. Prepare the calcium chloride bath: In a large bowl, combine 1000 ml of water with 5 g of calcium chloride. Mix thoroughly until the calcium chloride is fully dissolved. Cover and refrigerate to chill completely.
2. Prepare the lemon caviar mixture. In a separate bowl, combine 200 ml water, sugar (if using), lemon oil, soy lecithin, and sodium alginate. Add yellow food coloring to achieve desired color intensity. Mix thoroughly using an immersion blender until all ingredients are fully incorporated and the mixture is smooth. Cover and refrigerate for 24 hours to allow air bubbles to dissipate and the mixture to fully hydrate.
3. After 24 hours, remove both mixtures from the refrigerator.
4. Using a dropper or a small syringe, carefully drop small amounts of the lemon alginate mixture into the cold calcium chloride bath.
5. Allow the droplets to sit in the bath for about 1 minute, or until they form small spheres with a gel-like exterior.
6. Gently remove the lemon caviar spheres from the calcium chloride bath using a slotted spoon.
7. Rinse the caviar in clean, cold water to remove any excess calcium chloride.
8. Store the lemon caviar in a container with a small amount of water or lemon juice to prevent them from sticking together.
9. Serve immediately.

kxqy6tr,t3_1bu7y25,1bu7y25,"[Video and Full Recipe Here](https://tastefullygrace.com/baked-coconut-shrimp/)

**Ingredients:**

* 18 large raw, peeled and deveined, frozen shrimp about 1 pound
* ¾ cup sweetened shredded coconut
* ¾ cup panko breadcrumbs
* ⅓ cup all-purpose flour
* 2 large eggs beaten
* Salt and pepper to taste
* Dipping sauce to serve like sweet chili

**Instructions:**

1. Preheat oven to 400℉. On a baking sheet, mix together coconut and panko. Spread out in a single layer.
2. Toast for 4-6 minutes, tossing halfway through, until golden. Watch carefully! The outer coconut and panko will toast faster than the middle. Once out of the oven, season with salt and pepper, and toss again to distribute the toastier pieces. Set aside.
3. Thaw shrimp by placing them in a colander under cold running water for about 10 minutes, or until thawed. Alternatively, you can soak them in a big bowl of cold water for 20 minutes, dumping out the water and refilling halfway through.
4. Once thawed, pat the shrimp dry as best as possible.
5. Create an assembly line: the shrimp, then a bowl of flour, then a bowl of beaten eggs, then the coconut mixture, and then another baking sheet that’s lightly greased or lined with parchment paper.
6. Take 1 shrimp at a time: dip whole shrimp (but no tail if there is one) in flour and shake off the excess, dip whole shrimp (no tail) in egg and tap off the excess, and then dunk the shrimp in the coconut mixture pressing as much as possible on there. Place coated shrimp on the baking sheet.
7. Continue this process for all of the shrimp, placing them in a single layer (not touching each other) on the baking sheet. Tip: if you’re worried about knowing when the shrimp is cooked through, place 1 shrimp without breading on the baking sheet so you’ll know when it’s pink!
8. Bake at 400℉ for 10 minutes (no need to flip), or until the shrimp itself is pink and the tails curl in a bit. Enjoy with your favorite dipping sauce!",

**Ingredients:**

* 1 pound fresh salmon fillets cut into 2 or 4 pieces
* 3 tablespoons honey
* 2 large garlic cloves minced
* 2 ½ tablespoons soy sauce
* 2 tablespoons rice wine vinegar
* Red pepper flakes to taste
* Salt to taste
* 1 small bunch scallions chopped to garnish (optional)

**Instructions:**

1. Preheat oven to 450℉. In a bowl, mix together honey, garlic, soy, vinegar, salt, and red pepper flakes until well-combined. Set aside.
2. Lightly grease a baking dish or sheet, and add salmon.
3. Bake for 14-18 minutes, depending on the thickness of the fillets. Salmon is cooked when the center starts to flake, or the internal temperature reaches 135-145℉ depending on your doneness preference.
4. When salmon has 10 minutes left in the oven, preheat a large nonstick skillet over medium-high heat. Once fully preheated, pour honey garlic mixture into the pan.
5. Let glaze reduce and bubble rapidly for 3-5 minutes, stirring often. Glaze is ready when it has reduced by about half, and is darker and thicker but not burning.
6. Remove pan immediately from heat, setting aside. Glaze will thicken more as it cools.
7. Once salmon is done, gently slide salmon into the skillet, basting with the glaze. Serve with chopped scallions.",

How to make Lemon Lavender Cupcakes:

INGREDIENTS

* ½ cup butter
* 1 tablespoon dried lavender
* 1 egg
* ¾ cup milk
* 1 teaspoon lemon extract
* ½ cup granulated sugar
* 1 ½ cups flour
* 1 tablespoon lemon zest
* 2 teaspoons baking powder
* 1 teaspoon salt

# Frosting:

* 1 cup butter softened
* 4-5 cups powdered sugar
* 2 tablespoons milk
* 2 tablespoons lemon juice

# INSTRUCTIONS

1. Preheat the oven to 350 degrees. Place cupcake liners in a muffin tin and set aside.
2. In a small saucepan on low heat, melt butter and add dried lavender. Cook on low until lavender becomes fragrant, about 3-5 minutes, stirring occasionally so the butter does not burn.
3. Strain the butter through a fine mesh strainer into a small bowl. Discard the lavender.
4. In a medium mixing bowl, whisk together butter, egg, milk and lemon extract. Mix in sugar until dissolved.
5. Slowly add in flour, lemon zest, baking powder, and salt until just combined.
6. Fill each liner ¾ of the way with batter. Bake at 350 for 20 minutes or until a knife comes out clean. Remove from the oven and allow to cool.
7. In a medium bowl cream together butter, milk, lemon juice and powdered sugar until smooth. Pipe on frosting or spread on with a knife.",

**Ingredients:**

* 2 pounds baby potatoes red, yellow, or mixed
* 1 tablespoon extra virgin olive oil
* 1 tablespoon seasoning of choice see notes below for ideas
* Salt and pepper to taste

**Instructions:**

1. Bring a pot of water to a boil. Carefully add potatoes, and boil them for 10-15 minutes until just fork tender but not falling apart.
2. Drain the potatoes well.
3. Place them on a large, lightly greased baking sheet in a single layer.
4. Once they are cool enough to touch, use the palm of your hand to smash the potatoes as flat as possible without them completely falling apart. You can also use the back of a fork but I find that your palm works better!
5. Use a basting brush to brush each potato with olive oil, evenly distributing the 1 tablespoon of oil throughout.
6. Sprinkle seasoning, salt and pepper.
7. Bake at 450℉ for 30-35 minutes until the bottoms are crisp and golden. Broil them for 2-4 minutes after baking for extra crispy potatoes. Serve with more salt and dipping sauces if desired.",

[Make pic on Imgur](https://i.imgur.com/yZkB2YE.jpeg)

# Crawfish Étouffée

**Ingredients**

* 1 lb Crawfish Tails
* 8 tbsp Flour
* 8 tbsp Butter
* 1 cup diced Celery
* 1 cup diced Bell Pepper
* 1 cup diced Onion
* 2 tbsp minced Garlic
* 1 tbsp fresh Thyme
* 1 tbsp fresh Parsley
* 1 tsp Cajun Spice Blend
* 1/2 tsp fresh Black Pepper
* 1/2 tsp Salt
* 3 cups Chicken Broth with crawfish/veg scraps
* 2-4 cups prepared Jasmine Rice

The Cajun Spice Blend

* 3 Tbsp Paprika
* 2 Tbsp Garlic
* 1 Tbsp Sea Salt
* 1 Tbsp Onion
* 1 Tbsp Black Pepper
* ½ Tbsp White Pepper
* ½ Tbsp Oregano
* 1 tsp Cayenne
* ½ Tbsp Thyme

**Instructions**

1. Grind the spices for the spice blend or use store bought. If using store bought don't remove the fresh thyme and parsley.
2. Start a pot for broth. Simmer chicken broth and the crawfish heads/peels, onion scraps and a little of the celery scraps. Set aside at least 3 cups.
3. Cook rice per package instructions. I use a rice cooker at 1 part rice to 1.5 parts water.
4. In a heavy pan like a Dutch oven heat butter until bubbles stop and stir in flour. Stir for 5-10 minutes until color is blond. Light peanut butter is okay but  dark roux is not used for Étouffée. See tips.
5. Add the trinity onion, celery, and bell peppers and cook until celery is tender.
6. Add aromatics: fresh herbs, spices and garlic
7. Add 2-3 cups of broth and simmer for 30 minutes.
8. Add crawfish tails and heat through. They're already cooked.
9. Plate with rice and garnish with parsley and green onion. Serve with warm crusty bread.

Tip: The best tails are those saved from a crawfish boil. If using store bought get the pre-peeled tails not the frozen whole crawfish.

Tip: Sub the crawfish for shrimp. Never tried but I bet seared chicken chunks would be fine. Lump crab is always welcome.

Tip: For a more Creole style add some diced tomato to the simmer step and a Creole spice blend rather than the Cajun.

Tip: Roux requires constant attention. Never walk away from a roux. If you see small black specks consider starting over as the roux will be bitter.

Tip: Sub the roux butter for a nice vegetable oil in the same amount.",

ln82ndi,t3_1fh94ht,1fh94ht,"# Ingredients:

# For the Fresh Tomato Reduction:

* 1 kg fresh ripe tomatoes
* 30 ml extra virgin olive oil
* 1 tsp dried oregano
* 1 tsp salt - or to taste

# For the Pasta:

* 400 g Tuscan Sausages - sliced (or other good quality/outdoor bred pork sausages)
* 1 medium-sized onion - diced
* 2 garlic cloves - minced
* 300-350 g spaghetti - De Cecco or other good quality pasta
* 1-2 tbsp extra virgin olive oil
* Freshly grated Parmesan cheese - for garnish
* Freshly ground black pepper - to taste
* Fresh basil leaves - for garnish (optional)

# Prepare the Fresh Tomato Reduction:

1. Place the tomatoes in a large pot or bowl. Pour boiling water over them, ensuring they are fully submerged. Leave for **10-15 minutes** until the skins start to break.
2. Remove the tomatoes from the water, peel off the skins, and chop them, discarding the hard white core.
3. In a large, heavy-bottomed pot, heat 30 ml of extra virgin olive oil over medium heat. Add the chopped tomatoes, salt, and dried oregano.
4. Bring to a boil, then reduce the heat to low and simmer for **1-1.5 hours**, stirring occasionally, until most of the liquid has evaporated and the sauce thickens.

# Cook the Sausages and Pasta:

1. While the tomato reduction is simmering, heat 1-2 tbsp of olive oil in a large skillet over medium heat. Add the diced onions and sauté until soft and translucent, about **5 minutes**.
2. Add the minced garlic and cook for another minute until fragrant.
3. Add the sliced sausages to the skillet and cook until browned and fully cooked, about **8-10 minutes**. Set aside.
4. Cook the spaghetti in a pot of salted boiling water according to package instructions until al dente. Reserve about 1/2 cup of pasta water, then drain the pasta.

# Combine and Serve:

1. Add the sausage mixture to the tomato reduction, and stir to combine. If the sauce is too thick, use a little reserved pasta water to reach the desired consistency.
2. Add the cooked spaghetti to the sauce and toss to coat well.
3. Serve hot, garnished with freshly grated Parmesan cheese, black pepper, and fresh basil leaves if desired.

* 1 cup **Farmer’s cheese** or ricotta cheese
* 1/3 cup Granulated **white sugar**
* 1 tablespoon **Vanilla sugar**
* 2 **Egg yolks**
* 1 1/2 teaspoon **Baking soda**
* 1/3 cup **Sour cream**
* 2 cups **All-purpose flour** plus extra for dusting
* 1/2 liter **Vegetable oil** for frying

# INSTRUCTIONS 

1. **Cheese Mixture:** Press the cheese through a sieve into a bowl. Add granulated sugar, vanilla sugar, and egg yolks; mix well.
2. **Dough Formation:** Combine baking soda with sour cream and add to the cheese mixture. Gradually mix in the flour to form a sticky dough.
3. **Kneading:** Turn the dough onto a floured surface and knead briefly, adding flour as needed (the dough will be somewhat sticky).
4. **Shaping**: Roll out the dough to a thickness of about 1/2 inch. If the dough is sticky, dust the top with more flour. Cut out circles with a glass (about 2 1/2 to 3 inches in diameter) and make a smaller hole in the center with a bottle cap.
5. **Frying:** Heat the oil to 350°F (180°C). Fry the donuts in batches until golden brown, about 1 minute on each side. Remove and drain on paper towels.
6. **Finishing Touches:** While still warm, dip in glaze or dust with powdered sugar.",

**Ingredients**

* 2 pounds baby bella (cremini mushrooms) (roughly) between 1 ½ – 2 pounds
* 1 pound Italian sausage spicy or sweet
* ⅔ cup whole milk ricotta cheese
* ½ cup Parmigiano-Reggiano (or regular parmesan cheese) coarsely grated
* 2 medium shallots finely chopped
* 2 large garlic cloves minced
* 1 tablespoon fresh thyme
* 1 tablespoon fresh Italian parsley finely chopped
* Salt and pepper to taste

**Instructions**

1. Preheat oven to 375℉. Pop off each mushroom’s stem (you can use them for something else like stocks, sauces, stuffing, etc.!). Use a damp cloth or paper towel to clean mushrooms.
2. Place mushrooms, stem-removed side up, on a large, lightly greased or parchment-lined baking sheet.
3. Run a sharp knife along the outside of each sausage, popping the meat out of the casings into a medium pan. Over medium heat, use a potato masher or a large spoon to cut up the meat into small crumbles while it cooks.
4. Once the meat is cooked, use a slotted spoon to remove it from the pan, placing in a medium bowl.
5. Add the shallots and garlic to the pan and sauté in the leftover sausage juices for 3-4 minutes until hot and fragrant.
6. Use the slotted spoon to remove the shallots and garlic from the pan, placing in the bowl with the sausage.
7. Add parsley, thyme, Parmigiano-Reggiano cheese, ricotta, and salt and pepper to the bowl. Mix until well-combined.
8. Use a teaspoon to stuff each mushroom. I like to add as much filling as possible, making sure to tightly pack the stuffing into each mushroom “cup”. If the filling isn’t compact, some will fall out during the baking process!
9. Bake for 15-20 minutes until filling is hot. Let cool for at least 5 minutes before transferring to a plate to serve.",

To get around this, many countries require vaccinated chickens to be vaccinated against salmonella.The US doesn't have this requirement, so we instead advise against consuming raw yolks as a safety measure.

Studies have shown that both the washing/refrigeration method and the non-washing methods are equally effective at keeping eggs safe for consumption -- though the former keeps eggs fresh longer.

# Ingredients:

* 400g Lazanki pasta - (You can use any other type of square pasta, cut fresh lasagne sheets or pappardelle works good as well)

* 300g White cabbage 
* 200g White mushrooms 
* 2 Onions - medium sized, small dice
* 5 tbsp Vegetable Oil

* 2 Allspice berries
* Black pepper - to taste
* Salt - to taste

# Instructions:

2. In a large frying pan, preheat vegetable oil over high heat. Add sliced sausage and cook until browned, approximately **5 minutes**. Transfer the sausage to a plate, but keep the oil in the pan.
3. Reduce heat to medium and add diced onions. Fry until translucent, around **5 minutes**, then add mushrooms and increase the heat. Cook for an additional **5 minutes**.
4. Next, add diced cabbage and continue cooking for another **10 minutes**, then reduce the heat to medium.
5. Once the sauerkraut has cooled, chop it up and add it to the pan. Add fried sausage and combine all ingredients.
6. Cook pasta until al dente, then add it to the pan and combine. Season with salt and black pepper to your liking. Smacznego!

Ingredients

* 1 large aubergine
* Extra virgin olive oil
* Sea salt and black pepper
* approx. 180g leftover ragù
* 1/2 to 1 teaspoon of garlic granules
* 1/2 to 1 teaspoon of dried oregano
* 1 ball of fresh mozzarella (approx. 240g)
* 6 tablespoons of passata

NOTE: This is a recipe for leftover ragù. Whatever you have will do, but I'd recommend one that's heavy on the meat and light on the tomatoes. **Ragu alla Ferrarese** is my personal favourite.

# Step 1

Start heating your oven to 200°C. While it's warming up, cut your aubergines in half. **You can leave the stems on, or cut them off, at your discretion.**

# Step 2

Using **a small, sharp knife,** roughly trace a border around the edges of the aubergines (just under half an inch thick). **Score the flesh within that border to make it easier to scoop out and speed up the dicing process.** Then scoop out the scored flesh with a metal spoon.

# Step 3

At this point, you have two options depending on how much time you have and how soft you like your aubergine:

1. Sprinkle salt on your aubergine shells and put them to the side.
2. Garnish your aubergine shells with olive oil, salt and pepper, and put them in the oven for 10 minutes while you prepare the filling.

# Step 4

With your aubergine shells either cooking or resting, dice up the aubergine flesh, and cook in a small pan for 4-5 minutes with some oil, salt, pepper, garlic granules, and a little oregano.

**Soon enough, your aubergines (if you put them in the oven) will be ready to come out.** Don't forget about them!

# Step 5

Once the diced aubergine has softened, add your ragù to the pan and keep the heat on low for 2 minutes while you stir it through and combine it with the aubergine.

# Step 6

Now for the fun part. Scoop the aubergine and ragù mixture into your aubergine shells. Then pour on enough passata (around 3 tablespoons per aubergine half) to cover the filling.

**Slice your ball of mozzarella into fairly thick rounds** and layer it on top of the passata.

# Step 7

Drizzle with olive oil - paying extra attention to any exposed aubergine if your aubergine halves were not pre-cooked - and crack on some black pepper.

# Step 8

Pop your aubergine halves into **a small lasagna dish or baking dish with high sides**, and cook uncovered for approximately 25 minutes.

# Step 9

Carefully move your stuffed aubergine to a plate to cool for 5-10 minutes before serving. And you're done! Enjoy your ragù stuffed aubergine on its own or with a simple salad.",

# Ingredients

# Salsa

* 5 Dried Guajillo Chiles stemmed and seeded
* 2 Dried Ancho Chiles stemmed and seeded
* 2 Dried Morita Chiles stemmed and seeded
* 2 Dried Chipotle Chiles stemmed and seeded
* 2/3 cup Canned Diced Tomatoes
* 2 Garlic Cloves
* Kosher Salt to taste
* 1/4 cup Canola Oil
* 3 cups Water

# Chilaquiles

* 2 cups Canola Oil
* 12 Corn Torillas cut into 1 inch squares
* 6 Eggs

# Serving

* 1/2 cup Sour Cream
* 1/2 cup Crumbled Queso Fresco or Feta Cheese
* 1/2 cup Cilantro Leaves chopped
* 2 tbsp Scallions or Chives thinly sliced

# Instructions

# Salsa

1. Heat a large skillet to high heat and add all the dried chiles, cook, rotating frequently with tongs, until blistered but not burnt, 1-2 minutes. Transfer chiles to a heatproof bowl and cover with boiling water, let sit until softened, about 20 minutes.
2. Remove the chiles from water and transfer to a blender along with tomatoes, garlic, and pinch of salt. Puree salsa until smooth.
3. Heat the 1/4 cup oil in a large pot over medium high heat. Pour the salsa into the pot quickly, and bring salsa to a boil. Stir in the water, bring to a simmer, and let cook for 20 minutes. Add salt to taste. Set aside.

# Chilaquiles

1. When ready to serve, fry the tortillas. Set a paper towel-lined platter next to the stove. In a large skillet, preheat the 2 cups of oil until very hot, then add half of the tortillas pieces. Cook, stirring with tongs to flip and submerge the tortillas as needed, until very crispy, 6-8 minutes. Remove using a slotted spoon and transfer to a prepared plate. Repeat with remaining tortillas.
2. Transfer 1/4 cup of the frying oil to the skillet and crack the eggs into the hot oil. Cook the eggs ""sunny side up"" as this is the most attractive presentation.
3. Meanwhile, in a large mixing bowl toss the crispy fried tortillas with the salsa and mix to coat.
4. To serve, transfer chilaquiles to a large serving plate and top with sour cream, queso cheese, cilantro, green onions and a fried egg.",

It's not a ""seasoning packet"" it's like an instant sauce mix. All you need to add is butter and milk and it creates this sauce that vaguely resembles the taste of hollandaise.

I recommend everyone makes hollandaise from scratch - it's not super difficult, tastes 1000% better, just save it for last so it doesn't get too cold.

That said, I think that hollandaise is the wrong flavor here - I don't think the lemony-ness would go well with sausage. If we want a ""breakfast"" poutine, probably sausage gravy would be better.",

**Homemade Croutons:**

* 8 slices soft sandwich bread I like oatmeal or pumpernickel bread
* ¼ cup extra virgin olive oil
* 1 large garlic clove thinly sliced
* Salt to taste

1. Marinate chicken in balsamic, 1 tablespoon olive oil, and salt and pepper. *For grilled chicken,* preheat grill to high heat, and grill each side for 6 minutes (total 12 minutes) until chicken register at least 165 degrees. *For baked chicken,* bake at 425°F for 17-21 minutes. Set chicken aside.
2. Stack romaine leaves, and chop them into bite-sized pieces (see video for visual instructions). Place romaine in a large salad bowl.
3. In a medium bowl, whisk together ¾ cup olive oil, minced garlic, lemon, tabasco, Worcestershire, mustard, and salt and pepper to taste. Set aside.
4. **For croutons,** stack sandwich bread slices. Cut off crusts. Cut bread into roughly ½ inch cubes. In a large skillet, add ¼ cup olive oil, sliced garlic, and salt to taste. Preheat pan over medium-high heat until garlic starts to sizzle. Add cubed bread. Toast for 7-14 minutes, tossing often, until croutons are golden. Remove pan from burner, and remove toasted garlic slices if desired.
5. Toss in three-quarters of the dressing to the romaine. Lettuce should look shiny and well-dressed. Add more dressing if needed. Then mix in coarsely grated cheese.
6. Slice chicken. Either toss in chicken slices, or plate salad and top with chicken.
7. Plate, finishing with croutons, a little more grated cheese, and black pepper.",

**INGREDIENTS:**

# For the dough

* 4 cups **All-purpose flour** (500 gram)
* 1 cup **Warm milk** (250 ml)
* 2 tablespoons **Active dry yeast** or 50 gram fresh yeast
* 1/2 cup **Granulated white sugar**
* 3 large **Eggs** 2 for the dough, 1 for brushing
* 1/2 cup **Melted butter**

# For the filling

* 1 kg **Roasted apples**

# For the Streusel Topping

* 1 cup **All-purpose flour**
* 1/2 cup **Cold butter** cubed
* 1/3 cup **Powdered sugar**

# For the icing

* 1/3 **Lemon** juiced
* 2/3 cup **Powdered sugar**

**INSTRUCTIONS:**

# Prepare the Dough

1. In a large bowl, sift the flour. Warm the milk slightly, dissolve the yeast in it along with a tablespoon of flour and sugar, and let it sit for 10-15 minutes until frothy.
2. Whisk 2 eggs with the remaining sugar until fluffy. Mix into the flour along with the frothy yeast mixture. Gradually knead in the melted butter and continue kneading for about 20 minutes until smooth and elastic.
3. Cover with plastic wrap and let rise in a warm place for about 1.5 hours, or until doubled in size.

# Shape the Rolls

1. Punch down the risen dough and roll out on a floured surface to about 1.5 cm thickness. Cut out 18 circles using an 8.5 cm diameter glass, then make a smaller indentation for the filling using a smaller glass.
2. Place the apple filling in the center of each circle. Fold the edges slightly over the filling. Brush the edges with a beaten egg.

# Prepare the Streusel

1. Combine flour, cold butter cubes, and powdered sugar in a bowl. Rub together with your fingers until the mixture resembles coarse crumbs. Sprinkle over the filled rolls.

# Baking

1. Preheat the oven to 180°C (350°F). Bake the rolls for about 18-20 minutes or until golden brown. Rotate the trays if necessary for even baking.

# Prepare the Icing

1. Heat lemon juice slightly, then whisk in the powdered sugar until smooth. Drizzle over the cooled rolls.",

&#x200B;

**Ingredients:**

* 1 pound good-quality bacon diced
* 1 medium (roughly 1/2 pound) yellow onion chopped
* 2 large garlic cloves minced
* ¼ cup real maple syrup
* ¼ cup apple cider vinegar
* ¼ cup brewed black coffee
* ¼ cup dark brown sugar packed
* Salt and pepper to taste

**Instructions:**

1. In a medium pan, cook the bacon over medium-high heat until crispy (typically about 10-15 minutes depending on fat content).
2. Use a slotted spoon to transfer bacon to a separate bowl. Drain the bacon fat out of the pan, leaving the drippings (the tiny bacon pieces in the bottom of the pan).
3. Add the onion and garlic. Sauté over medium-high heat for 3 minutes until fragrant.
4. Add maple syrup, cider vinegar, black coffee, brown sugar, the bacon, salt and a generous amount of black pepper. Stir.
5. Reduce heat to medium-low, and simmer, uncovered, for 50-60 minutes. Stir occasionally. Jam is ready when the mixture thickens and resembles a syrupy, chunky jam. Keep in mind that the jam will thicken more when cooled, and you want some liquid so the jam isn’t dry!
6. Serve warm or room temperature.",

For the marinade:

- 5 tbsp sake
- 2 tbsp sugar
- 2 tbsp soy sauce
- 1 tbsp dark soy sauce
- 2 tbsp mirin
- 1 tbsp rice wine vinegar
- 1 tbsp chinese black vinegar
- 7 cloves garlic (finely minced)
- 2 tbsp ginger paste
- 1 tbsp hoisin sauce
- 1/8 tsp five spice powder

Other ingredients:

- 4 bone-in chicken thighs
- chicken stock
- 2 quarts mushrooms (sliced). I use a combination of portabello and shiitake.
- sesame oil

Directions:

1. Mix marinade ingredients well and allow chicken to marinate for at least 30 minutes. 
2. Preheat oven to 350F.
3. Saute mushrooms in sesame oil until golden brown. Set aside.
4. Place chicken thighs skin side down in an oven-safe pan (I use a cast iron) on stove top. Let the chicken and pan warm up to medium heat together. Set marinade aside.
5. When skin has browned (3-4 minutes), flip chicken and allow the underside to brown (1-2 minutes).
6. Add marinade to pan. Add chicken stock to pan until liquid covers 2/3 of the chicken, with only the skin sticking out on top.
7. Add mushrooms to liquid. Be careful not to cover chicken with them.
8. Carefully move the pan to the oven. Let it braise in the oven for 30-35 minutes, checking occasionally and spoon liquid over chicken.
9. Turn on the broiler to crisp up the skin again. Watch carefully, as it can burn. Should only take 1-2 minutes or even less.
10. Take pan out of oven and back to the stove top. Turn up heat and reduce liquid until sauce is thick.",

1. Mix the yoghurt with the gram flour in a bowl to get rid of any lumps to form a thick paste like consistency. Add the ginger, garlic chilli paste, paprika, chilli powder, garam masala, coriander powder, ground cinnamon, saffron and salt.

Thanks so much to u/love2bakecakes , the original recipe is [Alison Roman's Tiny Salty Chocolaty Cookies](https://cooking.nytimes.com/recipes/1020520-tiny-salty-chocolaty-cookies). I must have added the cinnamon and espresso and omitted the nuts, which must have thrown off my search. Appreciate y'all!

salted brownie cookies:

* 6 tbsp unsalted butter
* 2.5 cups confectioners sugar
* 3/4 cup cocoa powder
* 1/2 tsp salt
* 2 large egg whites
* 1 whole large egg
* 3/4 tsp cinnamon
* 1 tsp espresso powder
* 8 oz semisweet chocolate, chopped
* flaky sea salt for topping (optional)

1. Heat the oven to 350 degrees. Line two baking sheets with parchment paper.
2. Melt the butter in a small pot over medium heat, swirling, until it's starting to foam and brown, 3 to 4 minutes. (Whisk the butter from time to time so that the solids don’t stick to the bottom of the pot.) Let cool.
3. Whisk the confectioners’ sugar, cocoa powder, spices (cinnamon and espresso powder) and salt in a medium bowl, ridding it of as many lumps as possible.
4. Using a spatula, mix in the egg whites, whole egg and browned butter, stirring until you’ve got a good, smoothish mixture (any small lumps will take care of themselves), followed by the chocolate.
5. Using a spoon, drop silver dollar size blobs of dough (the texture is really somewhere between a dough and a batter) onto the baking sheet, spacing them about 2 inches apart (they spread a lot).
6. Sprinkle with flaky salt and bake until the cookies have flattened considerably and look baked through and a little wrinkled, 6 to 8 minutes. Let cool before eating so they can firm up.",

* Red pepper flakes optional
* Salt to taste

**Instructions**

1. Preheat oven to 425℉. Add basil, parmesan, pecorino, olive oil, pine nuts, garlic cloves, and salt to a food processor. Use the pulse setting to pulse pesto to desired consistency, scraping down the sides as needed. Set aside.
2. On a baking sheet, drizzle chicken with balsamic and sprinkle with salt (or marinate ahead of time if preferred). Bake chicken at 425℉ for 17-21 minutes or until the thickest part of the chicken registers at least 165 degrees.

3. Boil pasta until al dente, reserving ½ cup of pasta water when the pasta is almost done.
4. Add pesto, tomatoes, chicken, and red pepper flakes (optional) to drained pasta, and toss. Add a splash or all of the pasta water to moisten as needed. Toss again. Serve right away!",

kuz69wk,t3_1bfb943,1bfb943,"**Ingredients**

# For the Creamy Filling:

* 8 oz (about 1 cup) mascarpone cheese
* 3/4 cup heavy cream
* 1/2 cup granulated sugar
* 1 teaspoon pure almond extract
* 1/2 teaspoon pure vanilla extract

# For Assembling:

* 1 cup brewed espresso, cooled
* 1/4 cup amaretto liqueur (optional, for an extra almond kick)
* 1 package of ladyfingers
* Unsweetened cocoa powder for dusting
* Sliced almonds for garnish

# For the Espresso Soaking Syrup:

* 1/4 cup sugar
* 1/2 cup brewed espresso, cooled

**Directions**

# Prepare the Espresso Soaking Syrup

1. In a small saucepan, combine 1/4 cup of sugar and 1/2 cup of brewed espresso.
2. Heat over medium heat until the sugar is completely dissolved, and the mixture thickens slightly. Remove from heat and let it cool.

# Whip Up the Creamy Filling

1. In a mixing bowl, combine 8 oz of mascarpone cheese, 3/4 cup of heavy cream, 1/2 cup of granulated sugar, 1 teaspoon of pure almond extract, and 1/2 teaspoon of pure vanilla extract.
2. Use an electric mixer to whip the mixture until it becomes thick and fluffy.

# Assemble the Layers

1. Start by dipping the ladyfingers one by one into the cooled espresso-soaking syrup. Make sure not to soak them for too long; a quick dip is sufficient.
2. Arrange a layer of soaked ladyfingers at the bottom of your serving dish.
3. Spread half of the creamy filling over the ladyfingers.
4. Repeat the process with another layer of soaked ladyfingers and the remaining creamy filling.
5. Finish with a dusting of unsweetened cocoa powder and a garnish of sliced almonds.

# Chill and Serve

1. Cover your almond tiramisu with plastic wrap and refrigerate for at least 4 hours or, ideally, overnight. This allows the flavors to meld and the dessert to set.

For full recipe, tips, & tricks, visit: [https://maplewoodroad.com/mandarin-orange-cake-with-pineapple-frosting/](https://maplewoodroad.com/mandarin-orange-cake-with-pineapple-frosting/)

INGREDIENTS

Mandarin Orange Cake

* 15.25 ounce box of yellow cake mix
* 15 ounce can of mandarin orange segments
* ¾ cup vegetable oil
* 4 large eggs

Pineapple Cool Whip Frosting

* 12 ounces Cool Whip
* 20 ounce can of crushed pineapple
* 3.4 ounce box of instant vanilla pudding mix
* Extra orange segments and orange zest for decorating (optional)

INSTRUCTIONS

Mandarin Orange Cake

1. Preheat oven to 350℉.
2. Using a large bowl, mix all cake ingredients together. Yes, all of them (but remember: just the dry part of the cake mix), and give it a good stir.
3. Spray two 9-inch round cake pans with cooking spray and line the bottom of the pans with parchment.
4. Pour the cake batter evenly between the two pans and bake on the middle rack for 25 minutes or until a toothpick comes out mostly clean.
5. Let the cakes cool completely.

Pineapple Cool Whip Frosting

1. Using a stand mixer with whisk attachment or a handheld electric mixer, add all ingredients to a large bowl and whisk until it reaches stiff peaks. Due to the addition of pineapple juice, this may take about 3 to 4 minutes on the high setting.

Frosting and Decorating the Cake

1. Once the cakes have completely cooled, add about a half-inch layer of frosting to the top of one of the cakes, then carefully place the other cake on top of that.
2. Then, spread frosting on the top and sides of the cake and decorate with extra orange segments and a light sprinkling of orange zest.",

* 1 teaspoon tomato paste

* Salt and pepper to taste

**Instructions**

1. Preheat oven to 400°F. Lightly grease a large baking sheet.
2. In a dry pan, add the diced pancetta and cook over medium heat until just crispy. Remove the pancetta pieces from the pan with a slotted spoon, into a medium bowl.
3. Use the coarse setting of a cheese grater to grate yellow onion into the same bowl. Leave both the onion and its juices in the bowl.
4. Add the cheese blend, panko, garlic, olive oil, Italian seasoning, tomato paste, egg, fennel seeds, and salt and pepper to the bowl. Mix until incorporated.
5. Then add the beef and pork. Use your hands (best method) or two large spoons to mix together ingredients, until they’re well combined but not over-worked.
6. Form ¼ cup-sized balls and place meatballs about an inch apart on the baking sheet.
7. Bake for 16-20 minutes, until meatballs reach an internal temperature of at least 165°F. Serve with your favorite tomato sauce, or however you’d like!",

**Ingredients**

* 4 large flour tortillas
* 1.75-2 pounds boneless skinless chicken breast
* ½ cup ranch or blue cheese dressing
* ½ cup shredded cheddar cheese
* ⅓ cup buffalo sauce like Frank’s Original Red Hot
* 1 medium tomato diced
* 1 small head iceberg lettuce thinly sliced
* 1 small yellow onion thinly sliced
* Salt and pepper to taste

**Instructions**

1. Preheat oven to 425℉. Place chicken breasts on a baking sheet. Sprinkle with salt and pepper. Bake 17-22 minutes until chicken registers at least 165 degrees in the thickest part.
2. Let chicken rest at room temperature for 5 minutes. Use a fork and knife to shred and pull apart chicken into bite-sized pieces.
3. Transfer chicken to a bowl. Use paper towels to gently squeeze out extra juice, so that the chicken juices don’t make the wraps soggy.
4. Toss buffalo sauce into the chicken. Set aside.
5. Add a small handful of lettuce to the middle of a tortilla, then use tongs to add a scoop of chicken.
6. Finally, add 1-2 tablespoons of tomato, a sprinkle of onion, about 2 tablespoons of cheese, and 1-2 tablespoons of dressing. Finish with a drizzle more of buffalo sauce if desired. Don’t overstuff your wrap or you won’t be able to close it! Exact quantities of each ingredient depend on your preference.
7. Making sure the fillings are in the center of the wrap, fold in the sides of the tortilla over the filling. Fold up the bottom edge of the tortilla over the filling, holding the sides in place. Rolling the wrap away from you, tuck the filling in as you go. Aim for a tight roll, but not so tight that it tears the tortilla. Fold the side flaps inward before you finish rolling. See the video below for visual instructions! Repeat for other wraps. Enjoy!",

**INGREDIENTS**

* 32 oz cream cheese room temperature
* 2 cups sugar
* 6 eggs
* 1 can pumpkin (12 oz)
* ¼ cup sour cream
* ¼ cup orange juice
* 1 tablespoon cinnamon
* 1 tablespoon ginger
* 1 teaspoon nutmeg
* 1 tsp all spice
* 1 teaspoon salt
* 2 cups gingersnap cookies
* 4 tablespoon butter melted
* 2 tablespoon sugar

&#x200B;

**INSTRUCTIONS**

1. Preheat oven to 350 degrees and spray spring form pan with non stick spray.
2. Combine all ingredients for crust in bowl of a food processor and pulse until well combined and uniform small crumbs.

**Ingredients:**

* 8 large eggs
* 2 tablespoons Dijon mustard
* 2 tablespoons mayonnaise
* 2 tablespoons fresh lemon juice
* 1 medium shallot minced
* 1 large garlic clove minced
* ¼ teaspoon coriander
* Small handful fresh chives snipped
* Salt and pepper to taste

**Instructions:**

1. Bring a large pot of water to a gentle boil. Use a big spoon to quickly lower eggs into the water (so they don’t crack on the bottom of the pot). Immediately set timer for 12 minutes. Keep water at a gentle (not roaring) boil.
2. While eggs are boiling, prepare a bowl of ice water. Once the timer goes off, use a slotted spoon to quickly drop the eggs into the ice bath to stop the cooking process (preventing the yolks from turning green).
3. Let eggs chill for at least 10 minutes. Crack shells, rinsing eggs under cold water to ensure there’s no stray shells left behind.
4. Use the back of a fork to mash eggs to desired chunkiness.
5. Add in mayo, Dijon, lemon juice, shallot, garlic, coriander, a small handful of chives, and salt and pepper. Stir. Serve!",

ky0om1q,t3_1bvolk4,1bvolk4,"**Italianized Fried Rice**

This is a twist I made on the original chinese Fried Rice. I respected the original techniques (so it's also cooked in a wok), but I only used ingredients that are often used here in Italy.

  
**Ingredients (for one person)**

* 80gof smoked pancetta or cubed guanciale
* one serving of cooked rice, chilled overnight
* 2 green onions (both the green part and the white part)
* black pepper
* 2 eggs
* 40g of parmigiano reggiano
* 1 clove of garlic
* (optionally, if you want more umami) 2 anchovies

  
**Procedure**

1.  First, cooked the rice in a rice cooker (with salt) and let it sit in the fridge overnight
2. Fry the guanciale or pancetta in a wok with a little bit of olive oil. Start with a cold wok, to let the fat render out. When the meat is crispy, take it out, but leave the fat on the bottom.
3. Whisk the eggs with the grated parmigiano.
4. cut the garlic in brunoise and the white part of the green onions in rings of 2mm of thickness.
5. add the anchovies and the garlic to the wok on a very low flame and let them infuse in the fat. Grate some fresh black pepper and let it bloom with the garlic and anchovies for no more than 2 minutes (otherwhise it will get bitter). Then add the white part of the green onion and cook at low flame for about 3-4 minutes.
6. Add the eggs and parmigiano mixture and cook it briefly until half way scrambled. Then add the rice and put the flame to maximum. Separate the rice (you don't want any chunks) and stir vigorously until the rice and the eggs are cooked through.
7. When everything is cooked through, turn the heat off and add the green part of the green onions and stir them in.
8. Grate some extra black pepper and serve sprinkling some more green onions on top.

PS: I recommend to NOT use any soy sauce, since parmigiano and anchovies are naturally umami (parmigiano contains MSG).",

One may be a pig's leg, another a pig's belly, and another a pig's jowl, but they are basically the same category and basic preparation method, no? And China has a lot of pigs. Many, many pigs. And they also like to salt and dry cure their pig parts for many months. The spices/aromatics added may be different from Italy, but the end result is salt cured pork. 

I will grant that Chinese cured pork tends to be more dried out than European cured pork, and the Chinese products are never meant to be eaten straight but rather used as a flavoring layer in a composed dish. But I assure you that ham is a very common ingredient in fried rice in China, Taiwan, and Japan and using pancetta, eggs, scallions, and rice would yield a result that is arguably indistinguishable from a generic East Asian ham fried rice (I am Taiwanese, and I've been making ham fried rice my whole life). The addition of parm +/- anchovies is the only thing that gives it an Italian twist (but tiny salted fish are also a very common ingredient throughout Asia, although less commonly used in fried rice).

Indonesian fried rice (nasi goreng) uses fermented shrimp paste, which if you squint and don't look too close could be sort of like oil cured anchovies.
