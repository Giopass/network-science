EatCheapAndVegan,"From Target: 90 second rice $1.59 + low sodium beans $.99 = $2.58.

EatCheapAndVegan,"I‚Äôm so proud of me ahah ü§≠ 

I started with the basic idea I use to plan my weekly meals: 2 seasonal vegetables (squash and leeks), 2 protein sources (tofu and chickpeas), 2 carbs (rice and orzo), and 1 sauce (tahini). 

Then, I mix and match my plates differently every day. Because, yes‚Ä¶ I just can‚Äôt eat the same thing twice ü•≤ It‚Äôs my little annoying quirk‚Ä¶ but otherwise, I promise I‚Äôm super nice!

So, here are the elements to prepare:
‚Ä¢A baking tray with squash, chicken-style tofu, and chickpeas
‚Ä¢A pot of leek fondue
‚Ä¢A tahini sauce
You can also cook the rice and orzo ahead of time like me ! 

Store all the components in separate containers OR assemble your meal boxes however you like.
 Here are my 5 meals using this meal prep: (Of course, you can simplify by alternating Monday and Tuesday‚Äôs meals throughout the week.)

- üçõ Monday: Bowl with chicken-style tofu, roasted squash, rice, mixed greens, and tahini sauce.


- üçõ Tuesday: Bowl with orzo, leek fondue, roasted chickpeas, and tahini sauce.


- üåÆ Wednesday: Tacos with chicken-style tofu, mixed greens, corn, and tahini sauce.


- üç≤ Thursday: Chicken-style tofu in coconut curry sauce (reheat in a saucepan with coconut milk, curry powder, salt, and pepper), served with orzo and either roasted squash OR leek fondue.


- ü•ò Friday: Hearty soup with the leftovers (heat roasted chickpeas, leeks, orzo or rice in a saucepan with vegetable broth and soy cream).

EatCheapAndVegan,"This is nothing like the seitan you find in stores, it looks and tastes almost exactly like a chicken breast, and like tofu it will pick up pretty much any other flavor you add to it. This has become a staple for me, I make a double or triple batch on weekends and it keeps well in the fridge. Best of all, it has a full DV of B12 in one piece!

Credit to Edgy Veg for the base recipe here: https://www.theedgyveg.com/2014/01/20/vegan-buffalo-wings-recipe/ I make a few modifications, and my quantities are for a double batch of ""breast"" size pieces.

**Ingredients**
* 2 cups Vital Wheat Gluten
* 1 teaspoon salt
* 4 tablespoons nutritional yeast
* 4 tablespoons tahini
* 1.5 cups of water
* optional: 2 tablespoons tamari (can sub broth, soy sauce, coconut aminos, or just skip it)

**Instructions**
1. Mix the dry ingredients (VWG, nutritional yeast, salt). The Edgy Veg recipe adds poultry seasoning and onion powder, I skip these to have a more bland final product.
2. Combine tahini in 1.5 cups of water. It helps if the water is warm but cold is fine too.
3. Add the tahini in water mixture to the dry ingredients and stir gently.
4. Once the water is added to the VWG, it will start pulling together into a sticky mass as in pic 3. Knead very gently a few times, just enough to incorporate all the VWG. Knead more for tougher seitan, knead less for softer seitan. Divide the mass into approximately 12 pieces. Take each piece and fold gently a few times until it has a smoothish outer layer.
5. Once each piece is shaped, lay them all into a deep baking dish and cover with water--all pieces should be fully submerged for baking. This takes the place of boiling or simmering in other seitan recipes.
6. Add 1 to 2 tablespoons of tamari, soy sauce, or coconut aminos to make it soy free. This adds a savoriness to the final seitan pieces but you can skip it if you plan to cook it with other sauces.
7. Bake at 350 F for one hour! After an hour, drain off the water and save it to use as homemade broth, and let the seitan pieces cool for a few minutes. You can then use as a chicken replacement in another recipe, or cover and store in the fridge for up to a week.

**Lemon Pepper Marinade**
* zest of one lemon
* juice of two lemons (about a half cup)
* one clove of garlic, minced
* 1/4 cup oil of your choice
* 1/4 cup water
* pinch of salt
* one tablespoon black pepper (this is a lot of peppery flavor, I LOVE black pepper but feel free to use less, or more!)

Combine all ingredients and pour over the seitan pieces. Cover and refrigerate for at least 2 hours, or overnight.

When you're ready to cook the seitan, heat up another tablespoon or two oil over medium heat, and stir fry about 8 to 10 minutes on each side until lightly browned. Serve and enjoy!

This recipe is fantastic for batch cooking, and is endlessly customizable for your preferences. Add seasoning to the dry ingredients, or add a bit more tahini for a more succulent ""breast"" just bake it a little longer to fully cook through, maybe an extra 10 to 15 minutes. You can add barbecue sauce, buffalo sauce, teriyaki, etc. I'm not exaggerating when I say this seitan can take the place of chicken breast in literally any recipe. I've been using it in a lot of recipes my family made before I went vegan and it holds up.

The last slide is nutrition info from Chronometer based on the proportions given above. 135 kcal per piece, and a full DV of B12! I've tried a lot of variations on this, happy to answer any questions. üíöüå±",Basic Seitan Recipe - only 5 ingredients!

EatCheapAndVegan,"Over the last 15 years, I've rarely been able to make tofu palatable, it always had an intense soy flavor that I despised.

I've spent the last 2 years experimenting with tofu regardless because the 1lb packs are like $1.65 at Aldi, I can't resist.

This last year specifically has been a huge boon to my tofu prep skills. 9 months ago I discovered blanching tofu to remove the soy smell and flavor, and I've steadily been incorporating tofu ever since.

Today, I discovered that even soaking the tofu in heavily salted water overnight will do the same job as blanching. I cubed super firm tofu and soaked it overnight in another product I've always hated; Lawry's seasoning salt lol.

The intense saltiness and sourness of Lawry's makes the intense soy flavor and soy smell basically disappear, the two worlds cancel each other out and it's a beautiful marriage after rinsing.

I LOVE TOFU NOW. Just polished off a big ol sweet potato stuffed with tofu cubes and baked beans lol.

EatCheapAndVegan,"This is a super cheap, quick and filling meal! I always have a bag of potatoes hanging out in my cupboard, so this is a meal I make when I have nothing else planned and want a fast dinner. Kind of like a healthier version of fast food.

Any kind of potato will do, if you want red and starchy or yellow wax potatoes, both are delicious! Boil a pot of water, around 6 quarts if you're making dinner for 2, more if you're serving more people. Roughly chop about 1 lb of potatoes with skin on, no need to peel, and toss into boiling water. Boil for around 15 minutes and test with a fork for doneness. The fork should pass all the way through a potato chunk with no resistance. Once they're cooked through, drain off the cooking water.

To the drained potatoes, add about a half cup of unsweetened plant milk, half cup of nutritional yeast, about 1/4 cup of white vinegar, and salt and pepper to taste. If you have a seasoned vinegar that's even better. Mash with a potato masher, or a large wooden spoon to your desired consistency. Let cool for a few minutes, then serve with tortillas and taco toppings--shredded lettuce, sauteed peppers, jalapenos, onions, mushrooms, rice, etc. Beans are a great addition, but potatoes are an underrated source of protein with 15g per cup!

This is highly customizable to your preferences of course! I tend to leave larger chunks of potatoes but smooth is great too. Add a clove of garlic when mashing the potatoes, or roasted garlic. The vinegar is not really optional though, this is the ingredient that takes potatoes from a side dish to main meal material.",Mashed Potato Tacos,t2_rdvc5bo,0.87,291,1729463604.0,1729463604.0,56,cheapandbrittle,1g8azy2

EatCheapAndVegan,"I know not the best pic but it's got a lot of thick rich flavours and was way better than expected.
Ingredients:
Dark roux (flour and oil toasted in a pan until chocolate brown)
6 cups vegetable stock
2 tablespoons tomato paste,
One whole white onion, diced
Three cloves garlic
Vegan soy sauce
Thyme, oregano, smoked paprika, and chipotle powder. (Alternately use Cajun seasoning and add cayenne until heavily spicy)
Silken or soft tofu.

Cook Three tablespoons of flour with a generous amount of oil in a pot until dark rich brown stirring constantly to prevent burning
Slowly pour in the vegetable stock while whisking, adding in batches and mixing until incorporated then add the tomato paste, dry spices, onion and garlic.
Cook until onions are soft and then taste for spices. Go heavy on the spice as this is meant to be served over rice with tofu. 
Start your rice and turn heat on sauce to low. Gently Add your silken/soft tofu and ensure each piece is fully covered in sauce. Cover the pot and leave on low until rice is ready, then serve.

EatCheapAndVegan,"I don't know about you, but I am usually broke in January. It just seems like one helluva long month until the next cheque. I am not a great one for New Year's resolutions, because me and the entire boardroom in my head are usually at loggerheads about the starting date. It just never happens in January for me.

I did however start taking stock of my pantry. All those half packets of grains, pulses and freekeh (what was I thinking?) must be worked away before I buy any more dry goods, spices and exotic ingredients. This year is all about saving resources in every way possible! Money, energy, the planet and my sanity. I refuse to confess how many packets I counted today. That long wishlist of recipes have in any case become as obsolete as jogging the memory of why I made those eccentric food purchases in the first place. 
Nope! This is the year of streamlining how I do things in the future. I am trimming down my cooking operations, buying habits and hopefully slimming down my ever expanding waistline. 

There is also a dirty little secret to lay bare! I have an incurable fetish for fresh vegetables, and it has to stop. I simply buy way too much too handle, and I am resisting the lure of their voluptuousness, the shiny bright colours, oh and those crispy greens. Bugger it! I have instituted a new rule: The Holy Trinity is not negotiable - they shall always be readily on hand - carrots, celery and onions. The rest must have a definate plan. No more limp aubergines or wrinkly peppers lurking in a foot deep refrigerator drawer.

So, today another frugal stock clearing recipe for my Italian cooking adventure: 
FRIDGE CLEAR-OUT RISOTTO!
* 1 limp carrot: cut into small dice
* 1 celery stick: cut into small dice
* 1 chopped onion
* half a steamed butternut: chopped up
* garlic cloves finely chopped: quantity of your own discretion. I like a LOT!
* 2 veg stock cubes dissolved in 1 liter of boiling water
* some fresh herbs: I used thyme and bayleaf
* approximately 1 and a half cups of arborio or carneroli rice: if you are skint use plain longrain rice - it also works, and bugger the risotto purists.
* a good glug of EVO or cooking oil.
* salt and black pepper to taste
**** TOP TIP: you can any use other vegetables you have available.
Your Fridge - Your Risotto! Own It!

Prep done, now let's cook!
1. Heat up a good glug of oil in a pot, add the onions and saut√© until translucent.
2. Add the rest of the Holy Trinity, i.e. carrots and celery and cook until tender, then add the garlic.
3. Add the raw rice and stir until heated through and well coated with oil.
4. Add some stock just to cover the rice, and let it simmer away. At this point add the butternut or veg of choice and stir through.
IMPORTANT INFO: it takes exactly 35 minutes to cook a good risotto from start to finish.
5. When the stock has been absorbed into the rice, add more liquid to just cover the rice and simmer away, stirring once in a while.
6. Add the fresh herbs and a tablespoon of tomato paste if you like. To me it just enhances the flavour of the butternut, but totally up to you.
7. Keep doing this until all the liquid is absorbed.
8. Dish up and give a swish of olive oil if you want that typical richness so characteristic of a risotto. Not great for the waistline but irrisistably delicious. Season with salt and pepper.
Buon appetito!

ANOTHER TIP: take care adding delicate veg such as peas, asparagus, mange tout, and broccoli. Add them towards the last third of the cooking time. You will want to retain their bright colour and crispness.

EatCheapAndVegan,"I've been using 24-hour, no-kneed dough to make daily mini-baguettes which cost 10-15p per baguette to make. (Flour, salt, yeast, water)
They're great for having with soup, using as sandwiches (self-marinated tofu slices has been a very successful one recently), or just toasting with peanut butter on

They freeze amazingly well

On the days where I've got leftover baguettes, I'll use the dough to make pizza with too - it's such good pizza, so much cheaper than anything you can buy and is much tastier and healthier

I also bulk make pesto and tomato sauces for the bases and freeze them in bags (flat so you can break them up into chunks for meals)

If anyone wants the recipe, it's this:
1. 450g-500g bread flour 
2. A sachet of active yeast (or 1-2 tsp)
3. Some salt (I use 2-3 teaspoons, but do whatever you like)
4. 330ml-350ml of water
5. Mix all ingredients roughly in a bowl, don't need to be fancy with this, just make sure there's no dry bits left
6. Cover and leave between 8-24 hours (I've left it for 48 and it basically turned into sourdough starter)
7. Scrape the dough onto your surface, leaving the air bubbles (use plenty of flour on the surface 
8. Cut into rough baguettes, put onto a tray to bake
9. 220c for 25/26 mins
10. Scrape the surface flour back into the bowl, don't bother washing it up, then add more flour/yeast/salt/water and you've got dough for tomorrow 

At step 7 I've kept some dough back before and used it instead of yeast in the next batch and it made sourdough - bit of a cheats way to do it but works great for a tangy baguette ","Bread and pizza, 10-15p per portion",t2_vbvqlw46,0.98,115,1736212723.0,1736212723.0,8,vgdomvg,1hvfn69
