m1qw239,t3_1hcth5f,1hcth5f,"I lost my mother recently and now I'm cooking for myself every day for the first time. Your gift - and it is a gift - means I'll have options available in the future as I grow more experienced and more confident, new ideas to keep my choices broad. Thank you; I wish you peace and rest in the time to come.",
m1r88f2,t3_1hcth5f,1hcth5f,"u/TerrysApplianceSvc, 

I'm sorry about your situation. 

I love your website URL. I'd be happy to take the URL and your content on your behalf, unchanged, to preserve your legacy. Based on genetics I have thirty years left in me if I don't get hit by a bus. I'm training a niece for legacy Internet presence. 

I took a quick scan of your website and there a couple (pizza sauce and matzo balls) I plan to test and might roll into my own cookbook. Mine is targeted at a very niche audience of long distance cruising sailors and I give it away for free. If you'd care to share your name with me I'll credit you accordingly, otherwise just the website. 

For the website or your name you can reach me [dave@AuspiciousWorks.com](mailto:dave@AuspiciousWorks.com) . 

I lost my brother in law (ish - complicated family) to brain cancer a couple of years ago. I was holding his hand when he passed. I hope you have someone to hold your hand when your time comes. 

sail fast and eat well, dave",

m1rqydo,t3_1hcth5f,1hcth5f,"Thank you so much. You’ll live on through these recipes.

I hope this isn’t weird to ask but, would you be able to post a pic of you? I would like to print your recipes and make a book that I can add to my small home library and I would like to add a page dedicated to you.

I’m Mexican and one of our beliefs around death is that as long as you are in someone’s memory then you are still with us. Once the last person that remembers you is gone, then so are you. That is why we make altar’s with our ancestors pictures during Day of the Dead. It’s a way to keep them around for generations so that while they may be physically gone they can still be known by their future family and will always be alive in our hearts.",
m1quw22,t3_1hcth5f,1hcth5f,"What the hell is this ninja onion junk. How dare you do this to me. D: 

Really hope you get to enjoy your time, and I'm gonna make as many of these as I can I think. Hoping you're able to stick around a lot longer than the doctors say. <3",
m1qvrgi,t3_1hcth5f,1hcth5f,Thank you for this. I hope that you have a wonderful rest of your time here with us on earth and that you have lived a happy and full life.,
m1qwb3l,t3_1hcth5f,1hcth5f,Thank you. I'm calling these Terry's recipes.,
m1quyp3,t3_1hcth5f,1hcth5f,"Thanks for sharing, I already know some of these, and, based on your flavor profile, may i suggest you try: [https://tasty.co/recipe/creamy-tuscan-chicken](https://tasty.co/recipe/creamy-tuscan-chicken)

it uses cream sauce, which is fat, and most likely bad for you, but since you already have an expiration date, you might want to try it anyway. I hope you try to get at least 364 more great food experiences to match it. 

I'm not trying to be cynical here, but my best friend had similar news a few years back, and he tried turning it around:  making every day a good day, or at least a not too bad one.  You can have a lot of good days in year, more than some people have in their 80 yr long life. Enjoy the time you have, or as my friend rationalized it ""I'm really trying to die from decadent living, good food and booze, before the cancer gets me"" It's something that stuck with me.  Carpe diem/Seize the day.",
m1qv2t1,t3_1hcth5f,1hcth5f,"Thank you for these. As with all recipes that are passed down to me, I will think of you as I make them. I think this is part of why cooking is such a sacred art to me.",
m1qydcj,t3_1hcth5f,1hcth5f,Your good people Terry. Give Russell a scratch on the head on my behalf please.,
m1qzjiz,t3_1hcth5f,1hcth5f,I love that you’ve done this. I insisted that my nonna sit with me while I wrote down all of her recipes so that her legacy wouldn’t be lost. I learned how to cook by watching her and helping her in the kitchen as a child. I didn’t want to forget her or her cooking so it became a thing that every Sunday she’d cook and I’d watch as an adult this time and write it all down as a recipe. Now every time I cook something from that collection she’s in my mind and heart again. Thank you for doing the same.,
m1r0ymp,t3_1hcth5f,1hcth5f,"A few months back, a friend asked me about some hamantaschen I'd brought to work ~10 years ago. Only time I'd ever made them, didn't have the recipe anymore. 

Yours sound about identical and I can't wait to make them. Thank you for putting this together, and I hope your time left is full of peace and love!",
m1rih5h,t3_1hcth5f,1hcth5f,I’ve been making your latkes at least once a year for Oktoberfest and at other times and my sons all love them. If they ever have offspring they will surely continue to enjoy your recipe for many years into the future.,
m1rqhc1,t3_1hcth5f,1hcth5f,"Thank you for sharing these. It’s my 29th birthday tomorrow and we’ve got friends round, I have the day off tomorrow to prep and I’m cooking for them all. I’ll make sure they go to great use and use one/several of your recipes and think of you tomorrow as I do

m1rkddo,t3_1hcth5f,1hcth5f,"Thank you internet stranger for sharing a part of yourself.

I feel much the same as you, that those we have lost can live on in the food they made and the good times that come from that.  You are obviously Jewish and I'm an Atheist but every time I make one of my late mother's recipes there is a phrase from that runs through my head, ""Eat this in remembrance of me"".  

I will make one of your recipes and eat in remembrance of you.",

Cancer fuckin sucks. I appreciate you for your list, and will download it.  I have my son and his family over on Sundays to feed them, so I’ll raid your recipes for that.

m1rebkg,t3_1hcth5f,1hcth5f,"The most precious thing I inherited from my mom and grandmas were their recipes and recipe file boxes. I'd be honored to have yours, too. 

I think the saddest thing about my eventual passing is that I won't have anyone to pass my years of secret recipes to. Perhaps I need to start building my own digital archive to gift similarly.

I hope your doctors are dumb and you end up making my recipes after I'm gone because you're still kicking.",
m1rkusw,t3_1hcth5f,1hcth5f,"The French onion soup sounds divine. I am a little curious if I scoop out each batch of caramelized onions before cooking the next batch or the first (and so forth) stay in the pan the whole time.

I’m a dummy, so things like “twice cooked shrimp are bad” and “you have to warm up pita bread because cold pita bread is bad” and “DONT LIFT THE LID!” are all perfect advice for me.

E: The PopOvers will be the 1st recipe I will try to make. I've made them once before, but they didn't turn out right. I read your instructions & your notes. Looks like I had the batter cold before cooking. That's where my mistake was. Thanks for that 'Notes' on your recipe. I'll check it out!",💕

It took a bit of running around to find the hominy up here in the Great White North, but luckily there's a neat little Latin grocery store close by carries it. 

OP, I hope you're doing as well as you can be considering the circumstances. Just one of your recipes has already introduced me to some new ingredients that I'm excited to explore more.

So sorry to hear of your brain cancer. You sound like such a cheerful and friendly person, and remind me of some of my favorite patients who also had terrible brain tumors. I always try to remember them for the kinds of lives they led and the conversations we shared that weren’t focused on their disease. Sometimes those conversations were just a few 10 minute spans in the emergency room and hospital. Yet they are hard to forget.

Although we have never met, I like to think your recipes would serve the same purpose. Hoping your prognosis turns out to be better than predicted. Thank you for sharing your site.",

m1v14lp,t3_1hcth5f,1hcth5f,"Hey Terry, 

Thank you so much for sharing your recipes, I'm going to work my way through a bunch of them as honestly there's so much deliciousness there. 

I noticed [lemon chicken and rice soup](https://www.bupkis.org/index.php/recipes-2/soups-2/lemon-chicken-and-rice-soup) and you unlocked a memory, this is going to be the first recipe of yours I try. It's summer here but I'm cooking it soon anyway. 
When I was a kid, my mum used to make ""splodge"" which my dad and I loved especially. It wasn't a soup, it was cooked rice with a bechamel like lemon sauce and cooked chicken folded through it. 
My dad passed away this year and I miss him greatly but when I play a song that reminds me of him or cook something I know he would've loved it makes him feel a little less far away. 

As someone who adores rice in soup, I feel like your recipe has brought 2 of my favourite things together in a way I hadn't dreamed of. I'm not sure you'll ever read this, but if you do, thank you. It's 3am, this singular tear sitting on my cheek is a happy one filled with thanks to you for your kindness and a happy family memory unlocked. 

I will cook your recipes and think of my dad, but also you and your kindness.

Wishing you all the best from me here in New Zealand ❤️",❤

While I appreciate your candor towards finality I'm not sure I could handle it as well as you have.

But looking at the upvotes, I imagine if your website can sustain the reddit 'hug of death' DDOS attack' then your recipies, ideas and thoughts put to paper likely won't leave.

I hope you can put your website into a 'trust' with basic hosting and ownership to extend your legacy for friends, family and internet to continue to enjoy.

Hopefully you can find cheap affordable hosting for an extended time period after you have left this mortal coil.

Perhaps somewhere on this earth your recipies can be saved and kept alive.

Perhaps printing your favour into book form for archival and gifts to friends and family.

A self published recipie book.

It's never too late to leave something behind for others to appreciate.

""A society grows great when old men plant trees in whose shade they shall never sit""

Perhaps a legacy as simple as a cookbook for those you love and cherrish to hold on to you a little longer.",

m2adk5i,t3_1hcth5f,1hcth5f,When my grandma died my relatives threw away her recipes. Many of them were handwritten by her mother. Thankfully I can at least fake my way through a good number of my favorites but many dishes are lost forever. I am always going to be heartbroken over this.,

m6olkdz,t3_1hcth5f,1hcth5f,Terry we will never forget.,
m6zwol5,t3_1hcth5f,1hcth5f,"I'm late to the Bupkis party but I had to say thank you.  What a simple but true, honest, and meaningful legacy.   

A few thoughts ... First, funnily enough, I always figured it was ""bubkis"" but maybe this shiksa is just subconsciously revealing my love of Babka!?  Second, these recipes look ""scrummy"" (as somebody else said) and you are clearly an amazing human.  I wish I/we could cook for you ... or scuba with you ... or ask you whether to fix my Whirlpool washer or get a new one ... and compare recipes.  Instead, I will make and share these recipes with love.  May your recipes be a comfort.  

LBNL, I encourage you to read Being Mortal and Talking About Death Won't Kill You, if you have not.  I cannot imagine they have not already been recommended to you and -- as a smart, thoughtful, and straightforward kind of guy -- you have probably read them (and more).  However, if you have not, I found them invaluable to understand so much of what modern medicine and modern (American) society does not face, handle, or orchestrate very well any more about death.  I love that your neurosurgeon was candid in discussing the sand in your hourglass and I hope it far outlasts the predictions.  Both also available as audiobooks.  I hope your sand lasts long and your plan comes to fruition for however you want to pass to the next adventure.  Onward.",
m725x9b,t3_1hcth5f,1hcth5f,"Hey, you still hanging around? Made a meal today",
m7g48kj,t3_1hcth5f,1hcth5f," Souper big hugs! (Pun and spelling intended) I love some Monty Python. I was able to gift my wickedly dark and delectable sense of humor to our youngest. We still enjoy food and funny together, at 28 he/they will be moving back in this weekend. Don't tell him/them but I'm kinda happy to have him/them back home. 
My mother in law died very, very suddenly right in front of me at our rinky dink hospital. ER doc gave an 80 year old woman who smoked 2 packs a day for 58 years blood thinners and then a strong breathing treatment was given....well. Tur in s out she had stage 4 lung cancer and really bad COPD. You get broken lung cancer nodules very close to your bronchial tubes and before you or she knows it you've drowned in your own blood to the horror of your only daughter in law. 
 Okay my story aside other than food and family and downloading your recipes is there any else you have done or been that you would like us to enjoy for you after you're gone? A special shop or restaurant we can go and have a coffee, tea or something in your honor. 
I definitely think I'd like to know some kind of time frame before I pass. Don't get me wrong I'm glad it was very quick for my mom in law because I've watched someone pass from lung cancer and multiple myloma and neither is pretty. 
 I hope you are able to make even more memories over great food with good people!!!! I'll look for you on the other side one day! Thank you so much for sharing your recipe collection.",

I have my eye on a few of your recipes, I like your style. At the very least, your McMuffin recipe is going to be what I cook for my turn at breakfast. 

You can count on a toast to your good self at approximately 10:30am GMT on the 19th or 20th of this coming April. It probably won't be champagne, but it may well be a nice lambrusco depending on how the weather is looking. Worst case scenario would be a Shannon Swirl. A dubious concoction of room temperature sparkling white Australian wine rounded off with Solpadine.

I also love to cook for my wife, other family members and friends. I bet we would both agree that some of the happiest moments of our lives is when someone we love pushes away from the table and says ""that was great"". It's just such a satisfying feeling to make other people happy with one of the most basic needs in our lives.

I have bookmarked your site and will definitely be trying some of your recipes (but not the ones with broccoli) when we move into our new home that will be ready very soon.

I wish you all of the very best for a miracle cure if that might be of any possibility or otherwise a very peaceful and pain free rest of your time.",

I’ll share one of mine. My wife and I love going out to new restaurants. Shortly after we started dating  we couldn’t get a reservation at a place we wanted to go and ended up stumbling into somewhere else. It’s out of business now, thanks pandemic, but had this amazing scallop and eggplant. I decided to try my hand at copying it from the photo and recollection of the taste and my wife says I nailed it and it was the first thing she posted to social media in 2 years (and how her extended family found out she had a boyfriend) and the next thing she posted were engagement photos a couple years later. So, it’s safe to say, it’s a delicious recipe.

Scallops And Eggplant

Prep Time: 15 min  | Cook Time: 15 min  | Total Time: 30 min  | Servings: 2 

Ingredients:
6 large scallops
salt and black peoper
2 chinese eggplant
3 tablespoons minced fresh lemongrass, tender inner bulb only
1 green onion
1 tbsp chili sauce
3tbsp ginger
1 clove garlic
1/2 small Thai red chile, minced
3/4 cup Asian plum sauce
1 1/2 tablespoons hoisin sauce

2 tbsp unsalted butter
2 tbsp soy sauce
2 tbsp rice vinegar
1tsp garlic powder
2 tsp red pepper flakes
1 tsp sugar
1 sprig fresh thai basil
1 pinch furikake
1 teaspoon black sesame seeds

Directions:
Pat scallops dry, sprinkle with salt and black pepper and let stand while prepping to rise to room temp.
Slice eggplant into 5cm tall disks, matching the number of scallops. Salt the top and bottom of each slice and set on a plate lined with paper towels for 15 minutes. 
In a small saucepan, heat the 1 tablespoon of oil until shimmering. Add the lemongrass, green onion whites, ginger, garlic and chile and cook over moderate heat, stirring, until fragrant and just starting to brown, about 3 minutes. Add the plum, hoisin, and chili garlic sauces and cook, stirring, until thickened and reduced to 3/4 cup, about 8 minutes. Puree until nearly smooth with an immersion blender or in a food processor. 
In a large skillet, sear the eggplant in oil for 3-4 min per side  until golden brown and then add the sauce and enough water to cover 1/2 the eggplants. Cook until a fork tender. 
In another pan sear the scallops in oil for 2 min, add a pat of butter, flip and sear for another minute. Remove to a small plate.
Then add ginger, crushed garlic, red pepper flakes, sugar, soy sauce,rice vinegar, and a few white parts of the green onions into the remaining oil and stirred for like 1 minute to make a sauce. 
To plate, add 3-4 eggplant disks to your plate, add a spoon of the remaining sauce in the pan, then top the eggplant with a scallop and spoon the scallop sauce on top. Sprinkle with flake salt. And top with the green parts of the green onion.",

I kinda know what you mean about it being a sort of gift, having an idea of what's coming. My mom was like that -- she always was interested in medical stuff, and educated herself about what to expect. One important thing she was able to do: she told each of us that she forgave us unconditionally for anything we'd ever done to hurt her, and asked that we forgive her for anything she ever did to hurt us. It felt so peaceful. 

Wishing you peace and joy, because you've got it: ""everything else is mostly all nonsense.""",

Couple things about popcorn!

Canola oil is fine and has a very light texture, or tea seed oil if you really want to ~~waste high quality oil~~ get fancy! Peanut oil is good though, and I've used grape seed oil without issue.

Butter - There's a lot of 'pure' butter out there with too much water in it, and microwaving it will boil the H2O and cause it to spit everywhere in your microwave. An alternative is to slice the butter in half lengthwise and drop it in the pot you made popcorn in, with the stove turned off and (obviously) after you dump the popcorn out. The residual heat will quickly melt the butter and steam off some of the water--just keep swirling the pot around so the butter doesn't burn and turn gross.",

I also love finding personal recipes, the ones that are not from succesful websites and cookbooks. Nothing wrong with that, but personal recipes give me the feeling of original homemade food, like I accomplished something ""real"".

Also a good reminder in the edit. I have been preocuppied with my own mortality and the need of loved ones earlier and more than I should have due to circumstances. But it is always good to get a reminder not to get broody and stuck on what may be or the future. To go and enjoy and appreciate what you have now, who are with you now and to make sure you live while you can.",

Have you ever heard of the three deaths? 

The first death is when your soul leaves your body and your heart stop beating. The second death is when your friends and family gather together to consign you to the grave. The third death, is hopefully sometime far into the future, when somebody speaks your name for the last time. Us internet friends will be doing our part to keep you from your third death. 

Hoping the rest of your life is full of happiness and the quality stays high. I lost my mom to cancer a few years ago so believe me when I say: Fuck Cancer!

Thank you, Terry. I've downloaded and saved your recipes, and will think of you in gratitude when I share them with my friends.

“Do you not know that a man is not dead while his name is still spoken?” -Terry Pratchett

And this is a beautiful way to ensure your name is spoken for a long time.

And fuck cancer.",

m1sasky,t3_1hcth5f,1hcth5f,"Thank you for sharing this. It would be nice if there was a way to filter by vegetarian and non-vegetarian recipes, but I understand this is not a small ask. 

If you want to spend the time to make the change, I think adding the words:

""Tags: Vegetarian"" 

somewhere on the page of every recipe (or even just the word ""vegetarian"") would allow me to type ""vegetarian"" into the search function to find all the recipes you've tagged that way. 

It's not *really* that much of a pain as it is, but I think the same method would work for adding tags for other dietary restrictions too, should you want to do that. (example: adding ""No Shellfish"" to wherever you decide to write the tags would help people with shellfish allergies)",
m1saxy3,t3_1hcth5f,1hcth5f,"Hi. So many comments here, I don't know if you'll see this one.

gf and I have not been together long, but we do know we LOVE cooking with each other. I promise you, we will be picking some of these recipes and making them and somehow sharing the outcome of each one we make with you.

Thou shalt give thanks before the meal and kiss the hand that feeds thee. Thou shalt not neglect to share the fruits of the earth with thy neighbor. Thou shalt not neglect to feed the old and the sick. And, except in condition of necessity, thou shalt not eat in haste, in distraction, or alone.”

I love your sense of humor and am thrilled to now have Bupkis and also the knowledge of where the phrase comes from.  I look forward to trying the recipes you have recorded.

In exchange, here is the link to one of my own favorite recipes:  [Fire-roasted tomato bisque.](https://www.foodandwine.com/recipes/fire-roasted-tomato-bisque)

I’m not sure if you have heard of it, but [Internet Archive’s Wayback Machine](https://web.archive.org/) allows people to upload websites to their servers as a way to preserve them for posterity should anything happen to the original websites.  The idea of leaving your love for cooking as a legacy for others to enjoy is simply spectacular.

To quote the Bard:

“Nor shall death brag thou wand’rest in his shade,
When in eternal lines to Time thou grow’st.
    So long as men can breathe, or eyes can see,
    So long lives this, and this gives life to thee.”

Me and my family will enjoy these recipes for decades to come.

If I were to write a cookbook it would be like:

""Mueller quit putting the macaroni recipe on their box, try their website.

Sausage and cheese biscuits: preheat oven make biscuits. At some point make sausage patties

Peach Cobbler:

Preheat oven to 375, melt I sticker in 13x7 pan

Mix 1 cup flour, 1 cup sugar, 1 cup milk

Pull in melted butter pan, remember you forgot to drain the cans the can of peaches

Do that,

 pour in two cans of peaches (I dunno, like 14 ounces each) you might could use cherries, I dunno

Pour over mixture

Cook for like 25-30 minutes. 

I dunno, it was my grandma's recipe and I never got it exactly right, but if you put vanilla ice cream on top it's close enough.",

I printed the recipes and put a post it note labeled ""Terry's Appliances Services on it"", note that it's from Reddit and today's date.

I have been here over a decade, no posts from me in months, but for this I had to comment!  I have 2 adult kids, money means nothing, laughs, friends, family, and memories mean the world!

Terry, I'll never eat another Matzo Ball and not remember typing this, I'm old too, but you will live in my memories, and my family's memories (kids love to cook as well, you are now in the family cookbook :)).

My husband was stationed at Fort Drum a few years ago (we miss it so much up there!) and I cannot tell people enough how friendly and warm the people up there are.

Your post just reminds me of the sense of community and sharing that we experienced while living up there.

Op, these recipes will be your legacy. Before you and in these final days When you die just know that you have impacted thousands of peoples lives. These recipes some will be so good they’ll write them down and pass them on to their next owners. The next generations etc. 

I’m gonna go to the dollar store buy a cute lil notebook and some color pens and write down the  recipes I like and make a cute lil cookbook. 

Tho the first page will be my personal favorite banana bread recipe. 

Thank you op. For making an impact in my life though good food.

Some people make their mark like authors with books, actors with films, politicians with power, businessmen with money, models with looks, and murderers with vendettas. 

You made your mark with these recipes. A baker who made their mark with food. 🤤 ty",🤤

m1tzjjc,t3_1hcth5f,1hcth5f,"Terry, Ive been thinking of making an offline repository of stuff that I want to preserve if the Internet ever goes down Stateside. Things to host on a mesh network, for people to discover and learn from. I'll make sure your recipes are among the collection ♥️",♥
m1tzx3u,t3_1hcth5f,1hcth5f,"Well done. We put so much effort into creating content that it is a real legacy.

Two years ago, a friend asked if I could help someone who was in a similar situation as yourself. He had spent twenty years creating a website of well researched walks and photos of our local area, over 600 detailed walks. He didn't know me, but was desperate to find anyone who could help keep it alive. I was able to help out and take it on, together with a few others, and he died a few months later. The site was so huge (50,000 files, 16gb) and all written with Frontpage, so was a real nightmare to maintain.

That site is still up, and I've also been transposing the walks one at a time into a more modern web site that will be easier to maintain but mostly to get more people using them - that site launches in a couple of weeks.

This has made me ponder the future for these sites and others. With the likes of Github and Cloudflare pages and static site generators, it's possible to host these sites for free with little maintenance and also to make the code available for others so there is some longevity. The only problem I haven't yet solved is domain renewal and find someone trustworthy to share it with. How have you considered hosting when you're gone?

I like your site, and liked the warmth of it a lot. It was lovely to meet your animals, and a good idea to include the zip of the source.",

My mom did a kind of a crazy thing when she was ill enough to need hospice care, but had many good hours a day. She was a complete introvert, but she got out her phone and called two or three friends a day to tell them what she loved about them and how much she enjoyed them and that she’d be gone soon, but didn’t want them to feel like she didn’t care enough to let them know. 

She had been very quiet about her 3+ year cancer journey. It hit everyone differently. Several called back and told her that they were so surprised they couldn’t think of what to say. Then they told her what they loved about her and it really helped her feel connected. 

She was 84. She’d lost friends that she never got a last conversation with and she didn’t want to leave anyone wishing they’d talked. I thought it was a great idea and I hope I remember it when I am in her situation if I get the chance. Like you said, some people don’t get the opportunity that you have and my sweet mom did. Use it to its fullest! Hugs to you, Terry!",

My plan is to do something similar to what you're doing. It isn't just a pipe dream, either.

It’s a short video, I highly recommend you check it out. 

My family member with stage 4 cancer is a chef and was initially very against sacrificing any of their favorite foods with what little time they’ve got left, but since leaning into it and creating some amazing low carb recipes, they’ve outlived even the most optimistic timeline provided by their oncologist. I’ve tried some of their tasty keto creations and they’re mind blowingly good!",

m1x2doo,t3_1hcth5f,1hcth5f,"My dad was a skilled cook - when I was a baby, he went to culinary school for fun - and he created any number of recipes over his lifetime. He never wrote anything down and rarely told anyone his recipes, so when he died at the age of 85, most of his creations died with him. I know one of his recipes (baked mac and cheese), and I have given it to as many people as I can, but everything else is lost. Rather than hubris, I think it was laughable to him that anyone would want this type of legacy - and I wish he had known that we would have loved to have his recipes. Ok, knowing my dad, *some* of it was hubris...

I worked in a kitchen for a bunch of years. Our chef was a big deal chef, USA culinary team gold medalist. That's where I cut my teeth in the food industry, as a kid (16 years old). 

Your recipe for spicy BBQ sauce reminded me of a ""dish"" he would make for us from time to time. He called it ""ghetto gourmet chicken tenders"". He would fry some frozen chichen tenders, next door was the saute station.  He would take a hot saute pan and add a splash of butter, fresh garlic and red pepper flakes and get the flavors moving. Add a splash of white wine (""Zeus juice"", cheap boxed wine, the nectar of the gods) to deglaze the pan, then a hefty splash of sweet baby rays and toss the cooked chicken tenders in and a splash of franks. It doesn't sound like much, but when chef made it we all ate well and it was delicious. 

Thanks for bringing back that memory. Thanks you for these recipes.

Food is love.",❤

m23a6yk,t3_1hcth5f,1hcth5f,"Terry,  

Thank you for your unparalleled generosity and decency.  I feel incredibly privileged to be here today, sharing the same time in history with you, when we all could have been born much earlier or later.  There are quotes from Ruth Reichl that has really resonated with me over the years with respect to how I feel about the time I spend in the kitchen:

“And so I did what I always do when I’m confused, lonely, or frightened: I disappeared into the kitchen. “ I still believe, to the core of my being, that when you pay attention, cooking becomes a kind of meditation….  I learned the secret of life is finding joy in ordinary things.”  While we are complete internet strangers, I immediately jumped at the opportunity to try out part of the treasure you selfishly shared with us.

I’m not really big on turkey and always opt for beef over it, but the technique of adding an English muffin to your turkey burger piqued my interest. I just got done eating it and would like to tell you it was excellent!  It is jam packed with umami from the minced Bella mushrooms.  Salting the patties after taking them off the pan brought the flavor to focus.  Thank you. Take care and be well.  I appreciate you so much and you are a huge inspiration.

ETA: I wanted to post a picture but I guess that ability is not enabled in this subreddit.",

I feel honored to be able to cook them",
m24lb7r,t3_1hcth5f,1hcth5f,"In case you are still lurking around here, I just wanted to say thank you for this...from one malfunctioning brain to another. 

I had *just* set off to learn to cook when I began having seizures out of nowhere in my early 20s. Come to find out I have non cancerous masses in my brain. I ended up having well over a thousand seizures over nearly 10 years that inhibited my ability to do everything…drive, work, cook, speak, you name it. I could barely communicate. I had a somewhat experimental type of surgery in late 2022 that seems to have cured me. Even my team of doctors are calling it a miracle. I was supposed to have end stage dementia before 50 and am less than 20 years from that now. 

Gradually I’ve gotten back on my feet again. Back to work, back to doing a few things I enjoy doing. In the last few months I’ve started trying to relearn to cook. Mind you, I can barely boil water now 🤣 These will serve as some good lessons for me. 

The work that I’ve been able to return to also happens to be nursing. You don’t sound like you need advice, and you’ve probably got this ball rolling already, but I’d encourage you to talk through your wishes with your loved ones. Please make sure they know what you want as the time comes nearer, and get it in writing. Encourage your person to make difficult decisions if they align with your wishes. So many times I’ve been forced to deny people peace in the end because these wishes were never discussed, decisions are not agreed upon among family members, or feelings of guilt override what is truly best for the patient. 

Prayers for comfort for you and your loved ones ❤️",🤣❤

m251bg6,t3_1hcth5f,1hcth5f,"Hi OP, thank you for sharing this :) what an honor it will be to make the same recipes that brought you joy. 

Your message really struck a chord with me. My relationship with food has been difficult through my life due to eating disorders, but last few years I’ve realized there’s nothing that brings me more fulfillment than cooking, eating, and sharing delicious and new foods with the people I love. In Chinese culture food is a very integral part of love. You ask the ones you care about if they’ve eaten. As a child, the feeling of adults bring you peeled and sliced fruit is the ultimate form of love you know in a culture that doesn’t often say “I love you” between family members. At funerals you all go have a meal together as one big family after the ceremony. Food is so much more than sustenance - and I’m so thankful I got a glimpse into your life through this post and the recipes you share :)",

The purpose of life (Leo Rothstein)

I think the purpose of life is to be useful, to be responsible, to be honorable, to be compassionate. It is, after all, to matter, to count, to stand for something, to have made some difference that you have lived at all.",
m1ulmr3,t3_1hcth5f,1hcth5f,"This is great!I'm very sorry to hear about your diagnosis, but what a wonderful legacy. I'm definitely using this website. Here is my Banana bread recipe. It won a banana bread competition unanimously this year: 

Banana Bread:

1/2 stick butter- melted

▢1/2 cup brown sugar

▢1 cup white granulated sugar

 2 teaspoons cinnamon measured

▢2  eggs

▢2 teaspoons vanilla extract

▢ 3 ripe bananas- mashed

▢1 3/4- (never exceed 2 cups flour)

▢2 teaspoons baking powder

▢1.5 teaspoon salt 

I use a stand mixer, but this can easily be done in a Bowl. Mashing the bananas is the hardest part. I grew up doing it all by hand. 

 Line breadpan w parchment paper, then pour wet batter into pan- 
Sprinkle a little white sugar on top before it enters oven 

Bake 350 for 45-60 mins- check to see if done in middle w toothpick. Cook times vary based on humidity, individual oven placement, and banana content. ",

m1w4rfn,t1_m1vvaoz,1hcth5f," It's all just practice and tweaking things until you like the way they came out. 
There's no such thing as ""bad cook "" no matter what you want to make you just have to pick something that interests you and find detailed instructions on how to make it.. 

That's actually one of the reasons I put my website together. No matter what I wanted to make the recipes I found on the internet were not detailed enough and what I made never came out like I expected it to. This is why a lot of the stuff you find in my website has an exceptionally high level of detail for example what to look for when buying the ingredients, or tasting the tomatoes in the can or a bunch of other stuff 

Also the simpler the recipe, the less forgiving it is. For example it's much more difficult to pull off a perfect cheese omelette than it is to make the pozole. This is because the pozole has a whole bunch of ingredients and people taste them all at once and if one of them isn't quite exactly like you would want it nobody will ever know. If you screw up the cheese omelette it's apparent immediately. 

Anyway don't let cooking intimidate you. Find something you like and work at it like it's a science experiment until it comes out exactly like you want it, then have some friends over!",

I never wanted to fall into the trap of my grandmother's oldest cookbook that has a recipe for cookies called hamantaschen that calls for ""some""  sugar or whatever the ingredient was. But despite my best intentions I fell into the same trap

I took his magic sheet pans that never Warp, and some really cool spoons and spatulas and some other doodads they've never seen anywhere else but we're really nice for cooking like a beautiful set of mushroom brushes, and the giant roll Saran wrap. I think of him every time I cook it's a beautiful way to preserve a memory.",

m1sskx9,t1_m1sb8sm,1hcth5f,"I’m crying too. My friend died in hospice a few months back. I was honored to be part of her last journey, but she (I swear) literally waited to pass until her husband and mother weren’t in the room AND their daughter was at a friend’s house an hour away. I wish someone had been holding her hand—her husband never wanted to see anyone die but he promised her she wouldn’t be alone. In the 30 seconds between him shutting off the webcam to the bedroom and him going into the room, she took her last breath. 

I think she knew it would be the best time for her to go. My dad did something similar when he died 22 years ago. 

OP, I hope you have lots of support and that you receive care that limits your suffering but allows you to spend time with your loved ones. I don’t even cook, but found myself here. Thank you for sharing your story and your recipes.",

m1tof4z,t1_m1sskx9,1hcth5f,People often wait to let go until their loved ones are away. It happened years ago in my family and since then I’ve heard more stories like this than I can count.,
m1u2aid,t1_m1tdrre,1hcth5f,"I haven't written them down. I should. 

Let's see what I can do. 

The boats I move are nice but not superyachts. It's actually a pretty big market. A colleague was moving a boat from Newport to St Martin while I was going from Annapolis to Bitter End in BVI. He stopped for a break at Bitter End and we had a joint crew dinner. My colleague had provisioned entirely from the frozen food aisle. I had done better. \*grin\* Stories were told over dinner and the next morning the other crew sent an emissary to collect all our leftovers and extra food. 

One of my repeat crew members is a professional chef. He always makes a big deal out of not being expected to cook just because he's a chef. Then he disappears into the galley and wonderful things happen. On one trip he made a wonderful delicate ginger dressing by grinding up ginger snap cookies. 

My principal role is skipper. I cook because I enjoy it and because I got tired of bad food. Sometimes my other responsibilities interrupt meal preparation and I have to turn everything off and tend to other things. Recovering can be a minor challenge. 

Space is cramped in the galley of just about all boats. Two burners, tiny ovens, small sink, small top-loading refrigerator. Cooking underway is like cooking in an earthquake that doesn't stop. If our departure point is close to my home, I cheat. I make some things like lasagna and chicken pot pie ahead and freeze them. Meatloaf is easy enough to make on board but I'll cheat with that also. 

For lots of reasons, etiquette is a factor for me. Among other life shaping events I did an analysis of Emily Post and Amy Vanderbilt over three editions each. I never recovered. On one trip my crew made fun of me for trying to eat green peas with a fork. I've given up and now eat them with a spoon like everyone else. 

Those come to mind.",
m1u2u7i,t1_m1t8g06,1hcth5f,Interesting. I used to run ntp Stratum 4 on a home server which I thought was cool. No one else did. Now I just pull time from GPS which is plenty close enough for my simple needs. I have to have GPS for navigation anyway and at sea I usually don't have an Internet connection anyway. Starlink rocks by the way. I love trips with Starlink on the boat.,
