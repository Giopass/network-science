https://www.newsweek.com/fact-check-starbucks-ceo-apologized-israel-support-1859521

lum62mq,t1_lum042a,1gfzn0m,"For the people that actually believe this here‚Äôs a break down of what happened:

Starbucks Workers United (SWU) put out a statement supporting Palestine/Hamas after the October 7th massacre of 1,200 innocents . They have a similar logo, and Starbucks in their name. People have single digit IQs and thought this was Starbucks saying it. This led people to boycott Starbucks, graffiting swastikas on a store and calling them anti Semitic. A republican representative even said something along the lines of ‚Äúif you drink Starbucks, you‚Äôre okay with murdering Jews.‚Äù

In an act of damage control, Starbucks asked SWU to take the statement down, but SWU refused, so Starbucks sued for copyright infringement to get the statement taken down. This led people to believe Starbucks was anti Palestine, instead of just being anti ‚Äúmaking political statements strongly supporting either side because that causes severe backlash.‚Äù As you can see from the current situation, the same shit would‚Äôve happened had the union supported Israel and gotten their statement removed. The union also pushed this narrative about the company as well.

The only official statement Starbucks has made on the conflict is essentially ‚Äúwe want the killing of innocents on both sides to stop.‚Äù",
luowv29,t1_luotka5,1gfzn0m,"""There are, a couple of ways that spending money at Starbucks could potentially provide¬†*indirect*¬†financial support to Israel. First, this is through the activities of Howard Shultz, former CEO and current major shareholder. Despite leaving the company in 2023, his influence within Starbucks is still significant given how long he served as CEO and his substantial ownership stake. Shultz remains one of the largest shareholders with almost 3% of the company's total shares. Going back to the early 2000s, Starbucks faced boycotts under Shultz‚Äôs leadership due to his (failed) attempt to expand stores in Israel and for his pro-Israel views. For example, as CEO in 1998, Shultz received the ""Israel 50th Anniversary Friend of Zion Tribute Award"" from the Jerusalem Fund of Aish HaTorah for ""playing a key role in promoting a close alliance between the United States and Israel."" More recently, in 2021 Shultz supported Israel by investing in Israeli cyber-security start-up Wiz.

In another example of indirect financial support for Israel, some of Starbucks‚Äô biggest shareholders are also major investors in military companies with ties to Israel:

1. The Vanguard Group holds approximately 90.5 million shares of Starbucks (7.7%),¬†and is also a top shareholder in Elbit Systems, Israel‚Äôs largest weapons company.
2. BlackRock holds approx. 84.3 million shares of Starbucks (7.2%),¬†and is also a top shareholder in Lockheed Martin, which produces fighter jets for the Israeli military and boasts of being ‚Äúproud of the significant role it has fulfilled in the security of the State of Israel.‚Äù

This means that, in theory, the profits of Starbucks could indirectly support Israel by being reinvested into companies that produce weapons for the Israeli military. However, these linkages are not because of the actions of Starbucks or its current leadership, but instead reflect the actions of its major investors.""",

But even if I simply focus on the aspect of veganism, you're just flat out wrong and this way if thinking is damaging to veganism, hurts the animals. Seek out the truth. Israel is a good ally to veganism, with many state-of-the-art vegan startups and a large population of vegans.

https://www.israel21c.org/israel-has-most-vegans-per-capita-and-the-trend-is-growing/

lv1g1bt,t1_lv11xq3,1gfzn0m,"And that's where you are wrong. Except the going to Starbucks part, I never tried to tell anyone here that Starbucks is some sort of a great company that deserves praise or that you should now visit.

Still, it simply and objectively **is** great news for the animals, and it's a problem if vegans don't see it. Vegans cannot focus inwards, we have to face reality and work towards practical solutions. If the majority of the vegan movement learns to isolate themselves from the nonvegan world, we will stop growing. There's no one else but us who can stop animal consumption once and for all.

In this particular case, if vegan activists, or whoever made this change possible, simply ignored Starbucks because ""it's evil"", nobody would bother to force Starbucks into it, and Starbucks customers would keep consuming the same amount of cow milk. Thanks to this change, many more will try, and some % will stay with vegan milk instead. Mere 2% out of ~100M is 2M. Reduction of 2M cow milk drinks per week is very significant. And who knows, might be much more than 2%, there's vegans, people with IBS, lactose intolerant people, those who simply like the taste better... And it also makes vegan milk closer to normalization.

Whenever you start thinking about politics, union busting, and human conflicts... you make veganism about humans. It's not about humans. Yes, humans are also animals, but this should be only used as ""we're not above them"", instead these people use ""humans are animals"" as a way to defend the way they care about humans more than animals. Humans are the singular reason for all the unnatural animal consumption, slavery and torment. In this regard, humans have the right to zip it. Instead, plenty of vegans dare to drag animal rights down with their own agendas. Using them as usual.

And I'm not trying to say I'm this perfect vegan who only does things that help animals the most. Oftentimes I'm clueless as to what is the best decision, I have eaten a few cow-milk products by accident. But there are people who conflate veganism with socialism/communism/anarchism, with a fight against capitalism... and those things are obviously only their own agendas they dillute veganism with. It has nothing to do with veganism... that's just so selfish, egocentric and ridiculous.

Even Adolf Hitler was a vegetarian. Nothing stops literal Nazis from being vegan. I'd love it if our world was such that even as they sent humans into gas chambers, none of the victims nor the perpetrators would ever think of eating an animal... And conversely, none of the far-left movements inherently support veganism or animal rights. There are far-left vegans, but majority of the far-left are not vegans, so how do they dare to equate those two and claim it's in the best interest of the animals.

Our western democratic regulated pseudocapitalism, especially in the recent years, has done so much for veganism - more than a small group of people could ever do on their own. We have prepared a fertile ground, but it was large companies who planted the seeds, harvested the crops and sold the results to all people, vegans or not. I don't care their motivation is profit, I know that, but we still need them. Communism won't develop lab-meat, anarchism won't fill malls with vegan alternatives, we're on the right path imho and we are getting much closer to victory than ever. Vegan food and lab meat are more profitable than dealing with all the hassle of AG. They *will* help us, despite being greedy bastards. There's no way small local family vegan shops can ever do what these huge conglomerates do. If they happen to trample over human rights a little, I honestly don't care in this context, we deserve much worse. If we really want to help the animals, we need to use them.

All revolutions are extremely unpredictable and risky. If only humans suffered because of those risks, so be it, but people wishing for a revolution risk the future of the animals as well. Anyone who wishes to mindlessly tear down all of our current progress without thinking about the consequences, without any real plan for the days after everything's broken, they're not only a lousy vegan, they're just another enemy of animals.

Questions- Do you believe Israel has a right to exist? And if not, what do we do with 7 million Jews who live there? Put them in concentration camps? Force them to live in an Islamic theocracy where they will be treated worse than second class citizens? Kill them?

To me the ONLY path forward is one where the neighboring Islamists accept Israel is there and not going away and they come to accept it. Any other path is going to be bloody as hell. 

It is a fact that if Islamist theocrats put down their weapons, the fighting stops. But if Israel puts down their weapons, you'll see what genocide really is, real genocide, not this fake, hashtag culture genocide that falls far short of the definition of that word.",
lv2ztaz,t1_lv2kur6,1gfzn0m,"Never said they're all terrorists. But they are largerly indoctrinated and that's a problem. It also makes it easier for them to be recruited as terrorists, but they're not all terrorists. There's still a big step between being radicalized and actively participating in terror attacks.

Also notice that I put a lot of blame on *our* people. From what I know, I put most of the blame on the UN/UNRWA. They were in a unique position to push against indoctrination, radicalization and fake history in Gaza, instead they made things worse. UN/UNIFIL should have prevented the southern parts of Lebanon from becoming a military base cowering behind civilians, they have done nothing of sorts.

Basically, the neutral parties that were supposed to prevent conflict either incited conflict or silently watched as a conflict grew closer and closer.

I also don't support Netanyahu, and I suspect he didn't do all he could to prevent conflict. I wouldn't go as far as saying he let October 7 happen, but I think he could have done more to bring the area closer to peace. Although, he probably had no way to do that even if he wanted, given that the ""neutral"" powers were in fact anything but. Hard to say how extensive his crimes are, but once he leaves the office, I believe he will be tried and I hope his crimes will be made known then.

Of course, a huge amount of blame needs to be attributed to the Islamic Republic of Iran, Russia, Qatar and anyone else who helped feeding all the various terror groups in the area, and worked towards even more radicalization of local population.

Finally, if we assume all these things and the post October 7 conflict as inevitable, most of the remaining blame belongs to Hamas and Hezbollah. They willingly and repeatedly use civilians as living shields, refuse to allow civilians to use the extensive underground tunnels as shelters, refuse to return the hostages even though that would make it pretty much impossible for Israel to continue. If you haven't noticed, many Israelis repeatedly flooded the streets, calling for a ceasefire.

As in, many Israeli Jews, i.e. Zionists, called for a ceasefire much louder than many others, even though it was very unfavorable for them. Especially before the Philadelphi Corridor was fully taken, which I believe was a critical success without which I'd see many of the deaths as futile. Now, at the very least, a neutral force can prevent further smuggling and trafficking, making it virtually impossible for Hamas to rearm and bounce back.

Not that I see the civilians as acceptable sacrifices, I absolutely do hate that they had to die. But I also see Israel putting a lot more effort into limiting the number of civilian casualties, despite the insane conditions. Urban warfare in such a concentrated piece of land just can't be done ""cleanly"", not without going there on foot, which would mean huge losses for very limited Israeli army.

This is, by the way, one of the other faults of Netanyahu imho, he should have arranged for the US and perhaps others to send their troops, eliminating hamas mostly through personal combat. I hear (from a Zionist) it was possible, but Netanyahu was too reluctant to support a two state solution.

The only other remaining option was simply sitting down and doing nothing, while Hamas prepares for another October 7. That's simply inacepptable and I don't recall any other country from being prevented from defending themselves. Again, others have done less to prevent civilian casualties, Shock and Awe from Iraq says hello.

One more thing, even if they somehow managed to kill only combatants, the number would still be over 20000 or more. If you pay attention, you may notice that the UN specifically avoids saying things like ""combatants"" or ""soldiers"", they always say ""people"" or something, to make it seem that Israel killed civilians. Once you notice it, their propagandistic way of communicating things is obvious.

You don't have to believe what Israel says without question either, of course. But somehow we're in a situation, where the public doesn't believe what Israel says at all, but respects without question everything the UN says, despite it publicly and openly showing its affection for dictatorships and terrorists.

Furthermore, the links between Qatar and Hamas, Russia and Hezbollah (probably also Hamas), Qatar and Al Jazeera and between Qatar and school protests are publicly known facts, yet people completely ignore it all. China also invited Hamas and Fatah and helped them make progress towards some sort of union, because of course they did...

Simply put, there's a new ""axis of evil"", and that is Russia-Islamic Republic-China, along with their minor allies and countries that try their best to play both sides (e.g., India). The UN is mostly consumed by this axis and their proxies. Hamas and Hezbollah are their pawns, and so are all Palestinians at the moment.

I don't wish them anything bad. But I cannot imagine them deradicalizing themselves just like that, they need a new government and actual neutral oversight. Absolutely doesn't need to be Israeli, can't give you a link but Mossad had a statement or commentary where they clearly voiced their opposition to Israel being the one doing the oversight.

""From the river to the sea"" would mean nothing else than giving land to our enemies, because ultimately it would be the Islamic Republic and Co who would give the orders, but more importantly it would mean the destruction of Jewish future. I'm tempted to say genocide, because that's mostly what it would be, but I'd rather stay away from this term. Radical Islamism would take over and enact the same ethnic cleansing of Jews that happened in every other country that radical Islam took over (again, tempted to say ""colonize""...). Nobody in their right mind can imagine Islamism treating Jews fairly, there's no historic example of any such thing and no reason for it to happen now.

That, more or less, is the objective truth, at least as far as I know and as far as I am able to articulate it in a single post.

If nothing else, I hope you can see I'm not just simply someone who hates Muslims and who knows nothing about the conflict. I don't claim I know everything either, but having seen ""free Palestine"" activists not knowing what ""river"" and which ""sea"", I'm pretty sure I know more about it than many of those who which for a genocide of Jews, who now terrorize Jews all over the world, simply for existing, with their excuse for that being that Israel exists, which makes them guitly and deserving of hate or even death, according to many chants in the ""pro Palestine"" events.",

Again, not telling you what to do, but if your f says ""let's go to Starbucks"" and you say ""no, they're evil"", what is the chance of them accepting it and never visiting again? Now compare that with the chances of you going with them and convincing them to try coffee with vegan milk instead. Especially considering that vegan milk is objectively not some sort of a worse option now, not regarding price, not regarding taste. I'm still convinced almond milk is way better than cow milk, oat milk at the very least marginally so.

Don't you think the other option is much more likely? I believe that among the people who already like Starbucks, the group of regular customers who could be in some way convinced to switch to vegan milk in their latte is orders of magnitude larger than the group you could successfully convince to stop visiting Starbucks altogether.

Frankly, people in general do not care about them being a shitty company. That's the reality. Many companies do worse things and yet they still have customers, people just don't give up on their conveniences and preferences, even if those things are dripping with blood a little (metaphore for shitty behavior of your choice, from union busting to child labor). That's the way humanity is and you cannot change it (without a complete overhaul of education at least).

Also, even if you somehow managed to turn people against Starbucks and it would go under, some other company will readily take its place and your victory would mean nothing. Unlike the case where you, I dunno, visited Starbucks and handed out free vegan lattes to the customers, who, in the case of Starbucks going under, would look for another place with vegan lattes.

Can't you see what I'm arguing for is not really just my opinion, but my honest attempt to seek out the best outcome for the animals?

It's easy for a vegan to choose to ignore practical solutions for the sake of their ideals, because they won't suffer for it, they sacrifice the lives of animals just to uphold their own ideals. Every 0.01% decrease in animal consumption means millions of animals being spared from the hell that would otherwise await them.

So again, not trying to say you have to support companies you hate. But you need to consider them, their impact, and if such an opportunity arises, you need to talk with them and try to convince them to make at least a few small steps.

Simply calling them evil and closing the door yourself might feel good for you, but it's not the smartest decision if you really think about the animals first. It's a selfish decision.",
