m3p43d4,t1_m3ofkvb,1hlqlgq,If they have Muslim or Jewish people in the shelter they probably wouldn't be able to eat the grilled cheese sandwiches if they were seared in lard. Butter is a safer option in that scenario.,

I've never made a large batch of grilled cheese, but I think that would be easiest. 

If you really wanted to serve quickly you could pre-toast a bunch of bread then just broil two halves with cheese to serve. Bread would probably be a bit chewy or dry depending how long and how it's stored.",
