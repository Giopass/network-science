Ingredients:

For the Ravioli Dough:

- 300g all-purpose flour
- 100g semolina flour
- 1 tsp salt
- 200ml warm water
- 2 tbsp olive oil

For the Ravioli Filling:

- 200g firm tofu, crumbled
- 2 tbsp nutritional yeast
- 1 clove garlic, minced
- 1 tbsp lemon juice
- Salt and black pepper, to taste

For the Roasted Red Pepper Sauce:

- 3 large red bell peppers
- 2 tbsp olive oil
- 1 medium onion, finely chopped
- 3 cloves garlic, minced
- 200ml vegan cream cheese
- 1 tbsp nutritional yeast
- 1 tsp smoked paprika
- 1 tsp dried oregano
- Salt and freshly ground black pepper, to taste
- 1 tsp lemon juice

For Garnish:

- Fresh basil leaves, chopped

Method:

1. Preheat your oven to 200°C. Cut the red bell peppers in half and remove the seeds and membranes. Place them on a baking tray lined with parchment paper, cut side down. Roast for 20-25 minutes, or until the skin is charred and blistered. Once roasted, place the peppers in a bowl and cover with cling film for 10 minutes to steam. Peel off the skin and set the roasted peppers aside.

2. In a large frying pan, heat 1 tablespoon of olive oil over medium heat. Add the chopped onion and sauté for 5-6 minutes until softened and translucent. Stir in the minced garlic and cook for another 1-2 minutes until fragrant.

3. Add the roasted red peppers to a blender, along with the sautéed onion and garlic. Spoon in the vegan cream cheese, nutritional yeast, smoked paprika, and dried oregano. Blend until the mixture is smooth and creamy. Season with salt, black pepper, and lemon juice to taste.

4. To make the ravioli dough, combine the all-purpose flour, semolina flour, and salt in a large bowl. Make a well in the centre and add the warm water and olive oil. Mix until a dough forms, then knead on a floured surface for 8-10 minutes until smooth and elastic. Wrap in cling film and let it rest for 20 minutes.

5. While the dough is resting, prepare the filling. In a medium bowl, combine the crumbled tofu, nutritional yeast, minced garlic, lemon juice, salt, and black pepper. Mix well until evenly combined.

6. Once the dough has rested, divide it into two equal portions. Roll each portion out on a floured surface until it is very thin (about 2mm thick). Place small spoonfuls of the filling, about 4cm apart, on one sheet of the rolled dough. Place the second sheet of dough over the top, pressing around each mound of filling to seal. Use a knife or ravioli cutter to cut out individual ravioli pieces, ensuring the edges are sealed well.

7. Bring a large pot of salted water to a boil. Cook the ravioli in batches for 3-4 minutes, or until they float to the surface. Drain and set aside.

8. Pour the blended roasted red pepper sauce back into the frying pan and warm it over low heat. Add the cooked ravioli to the sauce, gently tossing to coat each piece in the creamy sauce.

9. Divide the creamy ravioli between four bowls. Garnish with chopped fresh basil leaves for a burst of colour and flavour.
