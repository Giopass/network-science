It was 1989. I was a freshman, playing college football.  We had won our conference for the first time and as a reward, we were treated to a BBQ by the husband of the team secretary, who just happened to be a professional competitive BBQ chef.  

As we are about ready to start.  The guy comes out of his 20ft long BBQ trailer with the stereotypical hog on a plate with the apple in its mouth.  He sets the hog on the table in front of us.  Then he grabs the ears of the hog and lifts it.  As he does, the meat LITTERALLY falls off the bone and onto the plate.  He then takes the skin and bones in his hands and walks back into to trailer.  I have never seen anything as mouth watering.",

lad0fhh,t1_labp7xg,1dolx4j,Looks like one. But if you look closely at the bottom of the knife just near the handle there‚Äôs a cut off where the metal is a little small.  This cut off is designed this way for safety measures. My company makes this knife. I was super curious if this was one of them,
lad3zfm,t1_lad21g7,1dolx4j,Thanks,

lafdm0f,t1_laetimt,1dolx4j,Not sure what it being for a sandwich has to do with resting your meat. But I know resting your meat longer will help your problems with soggy bread,

ladzq9v,t1_ladmqqd,1dolx4j,"There are also wooden chopping boards made of end pieces of wood that resemble a checker board that hold less bacteria because of the angle of the grain and it being resistant to chipping, this is just what I‚Äôve read about so I don‚Äôt physically know if this is true.",
ladppdc,t1_ladmqqd,1dolx4j,Last time I looked it up the worries about either type of cutting board wrt bacteria is pretty overstated. Less bacteria than you think ends up in those plastic grooves and wood tends to release a natural bacteria resistant substance when cut. I mean either way you have to keep it clean but it's less of a problem than people assume.,

ladnv3t,t1_ladkw3b,1dolx4j,"I agree, reddit is harsh. It is a good looking brisket and it takes a lot of skill to even get to that point so it's rude of me to say they don't know much. But if your restaurant is serving it to paying customers it's disrespectful to reduce the quality of the food by cutting it before it's done resting and squeezing the juices out. Just my $0.02. If it was your own personal brisket I probably wouldn't have cared enough to say anything",

lafndt4,t1_lafjw4h,1dolx4j,"The squeeze you saw in this clip is not going to dry out a fatty brisket, especially being served minutes later. This brisket was going into sandwiches so we actually cut it and put it on a draining pan to get some of the juice out. I‚Äôm sure I‚Äôll get roasted for that on here but there is a puddle of liquid still at the bottom of a pan and it gets extremely hot and hard to handle and if it‚Äôs too juicy it makes the bollio we serve it on turn into slop.",

lafxmej,t1_lafdm0f,1dolx4j,I assumed he doesn‚Äôt need it to be any more moist than it already is. Since it‚Äôs for sandwiches you won‚Äôt want brisket dripping with fat and juices and resting it longer would cause that more so.,
