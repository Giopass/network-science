kv13l2u,t3_1bfjyi4,1bfjyi4,Hell yea brother,
kv47acr,t3_1bfjyi4,1bfjyi4,"That‚Äôs awesome. Myself 4 weeks strict carnivore and now adding eggs and fish. Tired first 3 days, then an insane energy boost. That disappeared after a week and had on and off days. Taking care of the right supplements electrolytes for me, now back on track. Needed 8 hours of sleep before and still tired after waking up, now after 4 hours I‚Äôm sharp as a knife and keep going for rest of the day. Bodyfat to 9%, shredded as a mf. Kept my training on point with discipline even though some days was so tired (2/3 times a week). This is the key guys, experiencing any difficulty in life mentally or physically‚Äî> be strong and do strict carnivore for 1 month then see how you feel",
kv1izwm,t3_1bfjyi4,1bfjyi4,"So glad to hear your doing better! I‚Äôm curious if you‚Äôve told your doctor how you‚Äôve improved and if so, how did they react?",
kv198pk,t3_1bfjyi4,1bfjyi4,Awesome üòé,üòé
kv2e38r,t3_1bfjyi4,1bfjyi4,congrats! i'm interested to read about your recipe rotation,

kv1a79u,t3_1bfjyi4,1bfjyi4,"Your numbers are so similar it‚Äôs scary. I started at 306.6 although I began on January 8th and I‚Äôm down about 43lbs since!

My A1C was out of control and very high and it went down to 6 after a month (tested in February). I can‚Äôt wait to see what it‚Äôs like in May once 3 months pass since the last test. 

Interestingly my liven enzymes normalized after just one month while both AST and ALT were high due to my fatty liver prior. Crazy considering how much fat I‚Äôm eating. 

Congrats and good job!",
kvc3f1f,t3_1bfjyi4,1bfjyi4,"So good to hear stories like this, Congrats!!",
kvc4s6n,t3_1bfjyi4,1bfjyi4,"Nearly the same.  Long Covid sufferer, got up to 325.  Started eating only beef as an elimination diet due to Histamine Intolerance.....I didn't even know Carnivore was a thing.  Three months in and I am down to 288 and feeling MUCH better.  I have been taking blood tests every 3 months for a couple years as they try to fix the LC.....After 2 months of Meat/Fish only diet blood tests showed lowered Cholesterol, Inflammation, and Glucose....Even cleared up my liver function......The doctor that wanted to put me on 3-4 New meds won't return my calls after she read my blood tests and I told her how I got there.",
kvd1j9h,t3_1bfjyi4,1bfjyi4,What a great post! Congratulations and thanks for sharing your story‚Ä¶ especially love reading about your supportive medical team. You‚Äôve got this in the bag!,
kv1g9lp,t3_1bfjyi4,1bfjyi4,Congrats!,
kv2h592,t3_1bfjyi4,1bfjyi4,Well done üëç,üëç
kv38n3j,t3_1bfjyi4,1bfjyi4,"Please take pictures. I know you may feel self-conscious, but people react to images. Great progress btw! Keep going and keep up the updates!",
kv3hy61,t3_1bfjyi4,1bfjyi4,This is awesome! Stay after it!,
kv4ktl3,t3_1bfjyi4,1bfjyi4,Let‚Äôs go man! This is what I love to see. Did your cardiologist suggest carnivore?,
kv5t917,t3_1bfjyi4,1bfjyi4,Did you experience any gastrointestinal changes? Or changes in bowel movements?,
kvew5ce,t3_1bfjyi4,1bfjyi4,Fantastic. Keep it up!,
kvzi24w,t3_1bfjyi4,1bfjyi4,"Inspiring!  Thank you!

Starting today March 22nd.  146 kilos.",
kv38cii,t3_1bfjyi4,1bfjyi4,What were your symptoms before heart attack if you don‚Äôt mind me asking?,
kvb3gco,t3_1bfjyi4,1bfjyi4,sorry new to this subs. can u share your daily meals plan?,
kvegjiw,t3_1bfjyi4,1bfjyi4,Anyone have any info on T1D and carnivore? Been wanting to try but just not sure how and where to start.,
lasaiag,t3_1bfjyi4,1bfjyi4,Looking forward to hearing any updates. I hope you have continued making progress on carnivore,
kv75wyf,t1_kv47acr,1bfjyi4,Carnivore. This is the way.,
kv2sjuu,t1_kv1izwm,1bfjyi4,"I told my doctor I‚Äôm eating ‚Äúa low-carb, medium protein, high fat diet.‚Äù He high-fived me and told me he‚Äôs glad I embraced keto. He wanted to give me statins because my LDL was two over recommended. I told him we‚Äôll hold off. 

He is a great doc who works to cure people from type 2 diabetes with diet. We don‚Äôt agree on meds (he wanted to help me lose weight faster with Ozempic) but I appreciate his support.",
kv1kuwv,t1_kv1izwm,1bfjyi4,"I'd love to hear that too cuz I'm waiting to hear that, ""this diet will kill you"".",
kv2tycs,t1_kv2e38r,1bfjyi4,"We keep things simple because my wife joined me in this WOE. We rotate between:

- pot roast with the yummy broth 
- cheeseburger casserole 
- steaks: ribeyes or strip loin
- flanken ribs (Korean style ribs) these are short ribs cut crossways in thin strips
- bacon and eggs with hamburger patties
- ground beef with fried eggs
- a tin of sardines 2-3x a week
- bone broth 3x a week
- 5% Greek yogurt when I want a little something something. Usually my dessert on game night with friends each week. Not more than once a week. 

I supplement with LMNT and berberine. 

This keeps things fresh. We usually eat once day.",
kv75q1n,t1_kv1a79u,1bfjyi4,The same to you. I marvel at how quickly our bodies respond to good nutrition.,
kv5jh53,t1_kv4ktl3,1bfjyi4,"He did not. I was lurking here before my heart event and was fixing to start but got interrupted. He is not opposed and like my GP, recommends keto over the American Heart Association‚Äôs heart healthy diet. He‚Äôs also the one who explained that the heart‚Äôs preferred fuel are long chain fatty acids, like the saturated fats in red meat.",
kv75hm9,t1_kv5t917,1bfjyi4,"Some. Loose for the first week or so. Now, they are less frequent and reduced in volume. No gas or bloating.",
kvzl0lp,t1_kvzi24w,1bfjyi4,Today is a good day to begin!,
kv5ith9,t1_kv38cii,1bfjyi4,"Fatigue, getting winded walking up from the basement and chest pains. The chest pains increased with time as my health deteriorated. It happened fast over 3-1/2 weeks.",
kvbyqdt,t1_kvb3gco,1bfjyi4,"I responded to an earlier comment with what we rotate for meals. I generally eat once a day so I defrost a couple of choices to have ready. Flanken ribs, ribeyes, ground beef with eggs are my go tos. I like things simple",
kvjj0wp,t1_kvegjiw,1bfjyi4,"YES! Well more keto than carnivore but a book called Diabetes Solution by Dr. Richard K. Bernstein literally changed our lives (T1D diagnosis 15 months ago). He is a T1D himself and a huge advocate for low carb, high protein, and normal blood sugars. He has a YouTube series called Diabetes University. Also Facebook groups like typeonegrit and letmebe83 have been very helpful.¬†
We primarily use R insulin now to match the slower BG rise from protein/fat, and basal is probably half of what it was at diagnosis. God bless!¬†",
lbhpnsn,t1_lasaiag,1bfjyi4,"Thank you for asking!

As of July 3, 2024, I am at 277. My blood sugars remain at a consistent 105 average. My skin is clear, and I have gained enough energy to begin a daily calisthenics workout.

I had a setback regarding my heart. I received steroids in April for a respiratory infection. They wreaked havoc on my body. My blood sugars went ape crazy - over 287 the first day! The course also caused my heart to go into AFib. The first episode lasted over 4 days.

A long story short, I had an ablation procedure in early June. My recovery has been steady and solid. I continue to eat carnivore. I am certain if I was not doing so, my life would be vastly different right now. My body is recovering. One benefit of the surgery is that my bloodwork confirms my trend towards health. My cholesterol, my blood sugar, etc. all show a healthy baseline. First time in a decade.

Of course, I wish I had lost more weight, but I'm optimistic. I am getting stronger and healthier, bit by bit. While not as fast as I prefer, it's in the right direction!",
kv768l0,t1_kv1kuwv,1bfjyi4,Had a friend who is a nurse tell me to be careful cause saturated fats will kill you. I sent her a link to a study affirming the heart‚Äôs preference for long chain fatty acids as fuel. Silence.,
kv391is,t1_kv2tycs,1bfjyi4,i was thinking of buying some canned tuna. but isn't canned tuna/sardines processed?,
kv9u4yl,t1_kv2tycs,1bfjyi4,How do you prepare your flanken ribs?  I have some in the freezer and my husband says they look like dog bones.,
kvcaicl,t1_kv2tycs,1bfjyi4,Why only eat once a day? Would 3-4 times be too much on this type of diet?,
kv73glo,t1_kv5jh53,1bfjyi4,Well that‚Äôs great man. I‚Äôm glad you survived your heart attack and I‚Äôm very happy to learn your cardiologist and GP are supportive of a real heart healthy diet.,
kvzl1v4,t1_kvzl0lp,1bfjyi4,SONS OF ODIN CALL,
kv5jwac,t1_kv5ith9,1bfjyi4,Thanks‚Äî glad you‚Äôre ok now,
kvcjjyk,t1_kvbyqdt,1bfjyi4,thanks. will read this subs more,
lbli9m3,t1_lbhpnsn,1bfjyi4,"while recovering, there is a mild, productive state of insulin resistance --- itpart of how the body restores and repairs tissues. while that is ongoing, there will be less or no net lipolysis (drawing down from your fat stores)¬†

sorry about your respiratory infection üò£ but glad you got the care you did (is it too much to say it sounds like it was lifesaving! üôÇ) and be patient about weight loss, there's a lot going on right now with your healing.¬†

one benefit, since you say you have the energy to return to calisthenics, the mild IR (insulin resistance) within the context of the low and stable BG and insulin of carnivore, can help with increasing muscle, repairing muscle tissue after lifting. focus on how you feel, your energy levels, and your exercise/strength gains rather than the scale :)¬†",üò£üôÇ
kvc3q5e,t1_kv768l0,1bfjyi4,"It‚Äôs amazing isn‚Äôt it. How can they just be so blind and ignore the amazing results that come from it.
Hopefully someday they will embrace it help to understand why it works so well, and figure out even more facts about it.",
kv5ik6g,t1_kv391is,1bfjyi4,"I buy water packed with bones. They‚Äôre gutted and canned. Ingredients are sardines, water, and salt. That‚Äôs it",
kv5ap9l,t1_kv391is,1bfjyi4,"Tuna contains quite a bit of mercury, but it probably fine once a week. There's nothing wrong with sardines. Mainstream media will, of course warn you about sodium and cholesterol, but you know better. Just get the ones packaged in water if you are against vegetable oils and mustard",
kv5ods7,t1_kv391is,1bfjyi4,Try mackerel,
l86yaup,t1_kv391is,1bfjyi4,I prefer canned salmon. Better flavor and nutrition imo,
kvby6ib,t1_kv9u4yl,1bfjyi4,"Lay them flat on a baking sheet. Cook 40-45 minutes at 350¬∞. Salt and enjoy. That‚Äôs how we do it. 

Flanken ribs are short ribs cut crossways. Nice and fatty with a rich flavor. Our packs at Costco come 6-8 a pack. We each eat a pack for a meal.",
kvcnu3k,t1_kvcaicl,1bfjyi4,The basic rule of carnivore is eat when you‚Äôre hungry until you‚Äôre comfortably full. I generally don‚Äôt get hungry but once a day,
kv75j98,t1_kv5jwac,1bfjyi4,Me too!,
lblj0im,t1_lbli9m3,1bfjyi4,Thank you for this information and the encouragement,
kvbytkm,t1_kvby6ib,1bfjyi4,Thanks!,
kvd1ldd,t1_kvcnu3k,1bfjyi4,Interesting. I‚Äôll look more into it.,
