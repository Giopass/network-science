Sorry to bother you all. It seems like everybody has years and years and years left, right up until they don't.

**Edit**

It turns out that at the end of the road, the things that really mattered were good times with friends and family, And these were almost all in the kitchen. 

I've gotten to be relatively old, and finding out what I have certainly was not a happy thing, but given the number of my friends over the years that died with no notice from a heart attack or vehicle accident or whatever, this weirdly seems like a bit of a gift that I know what's coming and have *some* idea of a timeline. Although not a really good idea. 

Go home make yummy food and have your friends and family over. Actual happy memories are all that matters, money, power, status, everything else is mostly all nonsense.

**Edit**
This outpouring support and sympathy is more than I could ever have imagined! Thank you all I really appreciate it; However in the [immortal words of Monty Python ""I'm not dead yet""](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EfOW9QrLs0o) 8-)

Right now I only have major annoyances but no show stoppers. 

I plan to continue enjoying family and friends and cooking as much as I can, it's just harder and slower now because the surgery kind of wrecked my left side. On the other hand[terrible pun intended] I'm right handed,  so I can still do a lot of stuff, it just takes longer. 

**PS if any of you are cooking for anybody that has cancer and has no appetite, I can tell you from first-hand experience that [the banana bread](https://www.bupkis.org/index.php/recipes-2/favorites/banana-bread) goes down really easily and sits really well.**

The weird part about all this was that I initially found it and made it for someone else who had cancer about 25 years ago, And now we make it for me.

I also can't express enough gratitude that due to the efforts of friends I've never met all over the world the things that made me happy during my life will continue to make others happy for decades or maybe even hundreds of years in the future. The internet which is the very definition of ""not permanent stuff"" is now the eternal keeper of the things in life which mean the most to me which were food and friends and family.

Please note that I have read and appreciate each and every one of your replies. I have not answered them all because doing things online while missing large chunks of my brain is quite a bit more difficult than it used to be. But know that I read them all and you're all appreciated and I thank you all.
