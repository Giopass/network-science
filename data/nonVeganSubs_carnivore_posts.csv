carnivore,"In mid-January, I (59M) experienced a mild heart attack. They found 99% blockage in my left anterior descending artery, AKA ""The Widow Maker."" They applied a stent and sent me on my way. I began eating carnivore the last week of January.

I began at 310 lbs with type 2 diabetes. My A1c was 8.6. I was weak, and could barely walk around the house.

As of today, 

\- I weigh 293. I've lost 4-1/2 inches around my belly. 

\- I fit into pants I hadn't worn in a year and a half.

\- I walk 2-1/2 miles a day and began sprinting once a week last week. I sprint on a dead treadmill right now.

\- my blood sugars are completely under control. My average glucose over the last three weeks is 109. I use a continuous glucose monitor.

\- the bloat is gone. I can wear regular socks instead of compression socks without cankles at the end of the day. First time in 4 years.

I'm excited and curious to see what happens at 6 months. 


Update: I realized I wrote “strict carnivore” when I should have written simply “carnivore”. Sorry about that. ",6 weeks on carnivore update,t2_7rmpes6b,1.0,242,1710525068.0,1710525068.0,60,Cable_Special,1bfjyi4
