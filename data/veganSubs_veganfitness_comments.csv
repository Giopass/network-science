m4mm2b9,t1_m4m0dtq,1hq08ma,"Hell of a transformation, I am sure it was difficult, congratulations!",
m4lzbj2,t1_m4ls518,1hq08ma,"So push pull legs Monday / Weds / Fri and work days and off days were a mix of high incline walking at 4mph for 15 minutes then running at 7.5mph for the other 15 minutes. 

Lifting wise, I do 6 sets per exercise, classic pyramid light to heavy

This morning was pull so I did - 

Cable curls

Cable lat pulldowns

Cable rows

Deadlifts 

T bar rows

Face Pulls

Seated rows

Pull ups

Preacher curls

Concentration curls

Overhead Tri Extensions

Cable shrugs

So volume was around 120,000lbs~ish for the day and I do slight variations to hit slightly different accessory muscle groups that are looking fluffy

I basically went cold turkey into full plant based diet then adapted other pieces of the vegan lifestyle. I started off with something called the portfolio diet because my cholesterol was so high and after a couple months of doing that and bringing my LDL from 300 down to 80, I was on a roll. Nuts, tons and tons and tons and tons of oatmeal and overnight oats (this is predominantly what zapped my cholesterol so quickly), avocados, bean tacos, bean salads, veggie chili, veggie soups, LOTS of homemade fermented foods like kimchi, miso, tofu, natto, sauerkrauts, etc to establish happy belly monsters (I went down this rabbit hole 😂)",😂
m4lzuav,t1_m4ly3oy,1hq08ma,A little over 2 years!,
m4m6o1i,t1_m4m3pm2,1hq08ma,Ohh good call thank you!!,
m4n61r6,t1_m4mx7nb,1hq08ma,The diet certainly helped but I log and logged just about every bite of food religiously. It helped me stay on track and gain insight into how I was eating.,
m4n7yrt,t1_m4n7dhi,1hq08ma,"There's still times where I have junk here and there as it's important to be flexible in food specifically. My base food is mostly raw stuff, as close to the core ingredient as I can go. There was a minute where I was doing something called benecol butter for a couple of months because it was helping reduce my cholesterol, but then I just started making my own butter at home vs spending the $9 a tub on the stuff.",
m51flol,t1_m5191tn,1hq08ma,Yes indeed! I went into depth on this topic on the other post 😅,😅
m4n643u,t1_m4mtjt8,1hq08ma,You got this!!,
m4mml0s,t1_m4lzbj2,1hq08ma,How did that change from the start till now? What was your exercise routine like at the beginning? I’ve done vegan for a couple years of my life. It was definitely the healthiest I’ve ever been.,
m4pp8bs,t1_m4lzbj2,1hq08ma,Hell yes thanks for sharing this. I applaud you for such an amazing accomplishment!,
m4r3vg6,t1_m4lzbj2,1hq08ma,Like how much oatmeal?,
m4p5kqk,t1_m4n61r6,1hq08ma,That’s amazing. What was your calorie count throughout?,
m4n8ycs,t1_m4n7yrt,1hq08ma,"Nice, I’ve slowly begun making improvements but I have so much further I can go in terms of eating better. My biggest issue is that I’m always hungry even after what should be considered a good meal. That may be food addiction more than anything but I need to figure it out.",
m4n6vpz,t1_m4mml0s,1hq08ma,"So in the beginning my exercise was OK because I felt that it was important to ease myself into things vs jumping in and overdoing it. While I became more adept at moving and lifting, I started to do more and more to keep up. 

There were so many points where I had to break plateaus and those were probably the more challenging aspects of this entire process, but they worked really well for me. Things like running more, or running at all 😂",😂
m4r4ex0,t1_m4r3vg6,1hq08ma,"1 cup dry every morning - comes out to a lot 😂

It's about 400 calories per bowl for me. I use sprouted oats from Costco.",😂
m4p5xr9,t1_m4p5kqk,1hq08ma,"2500 per day, for the past four months it's been about 3500 a day cutting slow",
m4n94ku,t1_m4n8ycs,1hq08ma,"For me, part of it was mental and part was physical.",
m4nj58o,t1_m4n6vpz,1hq08ma,Thanks,
m4p6ab2,t1_m4p5xr9,1hq08ma,Im 54. A lifetime of heaviness. A vegan of two years. Lots of motivation from reading this thread.,
m4n9xoj,t1_m4n94ku,1hq08ma,"Yeah, there are definitely meals out there that fill me up specifically a green smoothie that I drink, but I struggle to replicate that with solid foods I think the mental aspect is a huge thing as well for me especially. Boredom, being in my feelings, whatever it is I think at times get the best of me",
m4pao7g,t1_m4p6ab2,1hq08ma,It's never too late mate. You got this!,
m4na4v4,t1_m4n9xoj,1hq08ma,Boredom was it for me! I was also diagnosed with ADHD which really helped my brain get you a healthy place once I was actually medicated for it.,

l3tuy3f,t1_l3nzyes,1cpj682,"I little bit of coincidence. We are avid documentaries nerds, environmental friendly activity lovers, and foodies. The week before marrying, we watched Cowspiracy without knowing what to expect. By the time we finished watching, and our jaws dropping, we looked at each other and said, does this mean we need to ditch meat. (By the way my husband is Argentinian and I lived there for 10 years, so we used to love a good BBQ). 
So, we immediately started changing our wedding menu (it was a very informal 3 days camping wedding in the middle of Mexican natural park, close to our home… as we used to live in Mexico City, at the time). So we replaced the BBQ for tons of homemade falafel, etc). 
Everyone was so pleased with the vegan menu we offered and it was such a success that it reassured us about our decision and never went back. Little by little I started to get in shape and started to enjoy the perks of a plant-based diet ( like not feeling bloated as soon as I finished a meal, feeling light, loosing weight, and opening my foodie spectrum to so many other untried vegetables and the rich Mexican inherently vegan gastronomy). 
We never went back and 4 years later we ditched our corporate job, I took a master in gastronomy and another one in plant-based nutrition and started a vegan food blog with the intention of sharing all the perks of following a plant-based diet and veganizing most to of the recipes that we were missing.",

l3u6q3j,t1_l3loh2u,1cpj682,"Well... I'd say start ditching what is easier to ditch for you. In our case we had a goal: become 100% vegan, but did not want to feel like if we failed with a meal, everything was going to go to hell. So We ditched rd meat and poultry immediately. My hb left Argentinean meat, only for bi Argentinean events, while we lived in Mexico. After a couple of months, he just couldn't eat it anymore. We had eggs or cheese, only in social events when we couldn't or didn't want to be a pain in the a\*\*. Like cake, or things we were unsure about. Then we just naturally found our ways to do it. Our favorite recipes are the ones we have in our food blog (ourplantbasedword.com), we we love curries (Indian and Thai, we found them very quick to make and being crowd-pleasers). All our non-vega friends love them, so everyone is happy. Also, they are great to cook in large quantities, so we always freeze them in portions, to have super yummy meals readily made. We also make lots of types of vegan pesto sauces, to be able to put flavor in our food quickly.

We ray to eat a lot of high protein foods, so we dedicate a portion of the blog to that, as we train 4-6 times per week, so that makes it easier to meet our fitness goals.",
l3tyjvb,t1_l3ol4st,1cpj682,I am glad you find in inspirational. Whenever I used to fall out for something not vegan my body immediately reacted with bloating or a number of symptoms. I think that helped a lot.,

I don't think I ever got around to having dinner that night. I was not in the same room when he died, but I was in the house, we were very much together and if there is more song & dance after this life I anticipate he will be saving a dance for me.",

I completely agree, you enjoy your time together until it’s over, but the part where you step out of this life and experience what’s next is a solo mission.
The process of death is way more bearable to do with the one(s) you love by your side. The shared experience of those last days make it a lot “easier” for the ones left behind, so it’s a win-win.
Sudden death is never easy, unfair and harsh.. especially at a young age.
I hope you’ll get that song and dance when you get there, but don’t forget to enjoy the time you have here! Take care!!",

I'm just curious. In my situation, I'm seven years older than my husband. I monitor my health indicators annually, and interestingly, my metabolic age is seven years younger than my chronological age. It's become a running joke between us that we're practically the same age, considering the -7/+7 balance.",
