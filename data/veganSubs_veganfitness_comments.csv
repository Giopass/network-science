Would lovw to know what your common workout split was in terms of cardiovascular vs strength and the break up of it?

Also, how did you transition into F/T vegan, what did your diet look like and how much did it change when you became vegan initially? 

Thanks",

m4mm2b9,t1_m4m0dtq,1hq08ma,"Hell of a transformation, I am sure it was difficult, congratulations!",
m4lzbj2,t1_m4ls518,1hq08ma,"So push pull legs Monday / Weds / Fri and work days and off days were a mix of high incline walking at 4mph for 15 minutes then running at 7.5mph for the other 15 minutes. 

Lifting wise, I do 6 sets per exercise, classic pyramid light to heavy

This morning was pull so I did - 

Cable curls

Cable lat pulldowns

Cable rows

Deadlifts 

T bar rows

Face Pulls

Seated rows

Pull ups

Preacher curls

Concentration curls

Overhead Tri Extensions

Cable shrugs

So volume was around 120,000lbs~ish for the day and I do slight variations to hit slightly different accessory muscle groups that are looking fluffy

I basically went cold turkey into full plant based diet then adapted other pieces of the vegan lifestyle. I started off with something called the portfolio diet because my cholesterol was so high and after a couple months of doing that and bringing my LDL from 300 down to 80, I was on a roll. Nuts, tons and tons and tons and tons of oatmeal and overnight oats (this is predominantly what zapped my cholesterol so quickly), avocados, bean tacos, bean salads, veggie chili, veggie soups, LOTS of homemade fermented foods like kimchi, miso, tofu, natto, sauerkrauts, etc to establish happy belly monsters (I went down this rabbit hole 😂)",😂
m65eptb,t1_m4mnj7v,1hq08ma,"Unfortunately he’s on steroids lol, look at post history.",
m4lzuav,t1_m4ly3oy,1hq08ma,A little over 2 years!,
m4m6o1i,t1_m4m3pm2,1hq08ma,Ohh good call thank you!!,
m4n61r6,t1_m4mx7nb,1hq08ma,The diet certainly helped but I log and logged just about every bite of food religiously. It helped me stay on track and gain insight into how I was eating.,
m4n7yrt,t1_m4n7dhi,1hq08ma,"There's still times where I have junk here and there as it's important to be flexible in food specifically. My base food is mostly raw stuff, as close to the core ingredient as I can go. There was a minute where I was doing something called benecol butter for a couple of months because it was helping reduce my cholesterol, but then I just started making my own butter at home vs spending the $9 a tub on the stuff.",
m51flol,t1_m5191tn,1hq08ma,Yes indeed! I went into depth on this topic on the other post 😅,😅
m4n643u,t1_m4mtjt8,1hq08ma,You got this!!,
m4mml0s,t1_m4lzbj2,1hq08ma,How did that change from the start till now? What was your exercise routine like at the beginning? I’ve done vegan for a couple years of my life. It was definitely the healthiest I’ve ever been.,
m4pp8bs,t1_m4lzbj2,1hq08ma,Hell yes thanks for sharing this. I applaud you for such an amazing accomplishment!,
m4r3vg6,t1_m4lzbj2,1hq08ma,Like how much oatmeal?,
m65hzwr,t1_m65eptb,1hq08ma,Oh… lol. He does seem to be well into the PEDs. Hopefully he hasn’t traded one cause of death for another,
m4p5kqk,t1_m4n61r6,1hq08ma,That’s amazing. What was your calorie count throughout?,
m4n8ycs,t1_m4n7yrt,1hq08ma,"Nice, I’ve slowly begun making improvements but I have so much further I can go in terms of eating better. My biggest issue is that I’m always hungry even after what should be considered a good meal. That may be food addiction more than anything but I need to figure it out.",
m4n6vpz,t1_m4mml0s,1hq08ma,"So in the beginning my exercise was OK because I felt that it was important to ease myself into things vs jumping in and overdoing it. While I became more adept at moving and lifting, I started to do more and more to keep up. 

There were so many points where I had to break plateaus and those were probably the more challenging aspects of this entire process, but they worked really well for me. Things like running more, or running at all 😂",😂
m4r4ex0,t1_m4r3vg6,1hq08ma,"1 cup dry every morning - comes out to a lot 😂

It's about 400 calories per bowl for me. I use sprouted oats from Costco.",😂
m69m6bc,t1_m65hzwr,1hq08ma,"Yup, not sure why this wasn’t mentioned in the original post either.",
m4p5xr9,t1_m4p5kqk,1hq08ma,"2500 per day, for the past four months it's been about 3500 a day cutting slow",
m4n94ku,t1_m4n8ycs,1hq08ma,"For me, part of it was mental and part was physical.",
m4nj58o,t1_m4n6vpz,1hq08ma,Thanks,
m4p6ab2,t1_m4p5xr9,1hq08ma,Im 54. A lifetime of heaviness. A vegan of two years. Lots of motivation from reading this thread.,
m4n9xoj,t1_m4n94ku,1hq08ma,"Yeah, there are definitely meals out there that fill me up specifically a green smoothie that I drink, but I struggle to replicate that with solid foods I think the mental aspect is a huge thing as well for me especially. Boredom, being in my feelings, whatever it is I think at times get the best of me",
m4pao7g,t1_m4p6ab2,1hq08ma,It's never too late mate. You got this!,
m4na4v4,t1_m4n9xoj,1hq08ma,Boredom was it for me! I was also diagnosed with ADHD which really helped my brain get you a healthy place once I was actually medicated for it.,
