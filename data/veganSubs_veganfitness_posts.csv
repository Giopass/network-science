veganfitness,"Went from 350 pounds to 194 where I am now.

I was very heavy my entire life and decided that when my son was born, I'd need to change my ways for his benefit, and the benefit of my loving family. Becoming vegan was the hardest decision of my life but the one that brought me the best results I could have ever imagined. 

I went from a 62 waist to a 32 where I am now and I've really gotten heavy duty into powerlifting and body sculpting in general.

My health changed CONSIDERABLY once I was not stuck eating animal products, the weight melted off, my body just became incredibly optimal in so many ways. To me, this is my way of life, as it should be, I'm so thankful to plants!!! 😁",Journey from 350 to 194 ,t2_5opq1sjsd,0.98,2579,1735599962.0,1735599962.0,123,Moobygriller,1hq08ma
veganfitness,"The same day we got married we decided to go vegan. We have become the healthiest versions of ourselves since then. We started the day with a vegan protein-packed breakfast consisting of homemade yellow lentil crepes with charred tofu-seitan strips, soy milk cappuccino and apple celery juice; the hit the gym, had a wonderful kale salad with homemade hummus and a marinated tofu steak for lunch and now getting ready for the beach and going 🕺🏼 tonight! My kind of anniversary!
