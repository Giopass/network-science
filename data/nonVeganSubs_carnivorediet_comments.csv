l37bj7t,t3_1cndy74,1cndy74,"A tip for the electrolytes:

Get a good free form taurine supplement. I at 120lb female take 1g every 4-6 hours. 

Taurine is an osmolyte, it balances electrolytes. It is also heat sensitive.

And a tip for histamine intolerance:

If you can stomach it, try some kidney. Its high in DAO which helps to break down excess histamine.",

l3a5la7,t3_1cndy74,1cndy74,"As someone who had stage 2 non-alcoholic liver induced cirrhosis due to fatty liver and on top of that had Psoriasis and Psoriasis Arthritis, I was taking a ton of meds with horrible interactions,prescribed by the same doctor. I threw up almost daily. I'm no longer on any meds and no inflammation.  Nothing. My rheumatologist berated me for eating meat, but when I told him that I'm no longer taking my meds, he was surprised to find out that I wasn't in pain anymore. I was still sick and still in pain on meds. I once took a morphine derivative and sat down after a while, looking at the wall while drooling. I couldn't control my body at all and the pain was still there! When I told him that I was still in pain, he prescribed stronger doses or another medicine. No more! No, thank you! I'm good being pain free and meds free! So up yours, Big Pharma!",

Question has anyone had bad stomach issues from butter. There’s a lady that eats sticks as a snack. I have had it for a few days and I’m so sick. I didn’t know what was going on until I realized I haven’t been eating dairy and then I added butter and I’m swollen like a balloon. Also I am new to this. How do I transition to totally meat without having side effects.",

lqv6b0q,t3_1cndy74,1cndy74,"I’ve been carnivore 3 weeks now. First two weeks my stomach started becoming flat less bloated. For some reason this past week it’s the opposite.

I have a runny stomach and it feels and looks pretty bloated.

I Mainly eat steak, eggs and bone broth. 

I also find that I don’t have as much muscle definition as previous.

I lift weights. So staying toned and muscular is important to me. I moved into carnivore as I was mostly always bloated and had inflammation often showing up in a rash. 

I do have black coffee pre workout. Usually train fasted.

My skin feels tighter but my muscle feels soft and not hard. I’m still young (40) so I’m not in menopause. 

Any advice would be appreciated

I’ve tried everything for histamines….DAO, kidneys, BPC157.  I’m not sure what’s going on with beef really.  Even unaged beef causes a reaction.

My treatment caused nodules on my thyroid.  I seem to get histamine symptoms early on which then causes the nodules to swell.  I was certain unaged beef would be the answer but no.  

Every so often I throw in a big fat steak because one has no effect.  I mean I’m sure it does, but I don’t notice.  No itchy eyes or sneezing.  And……steak 😋",😋

l38m5gq,t1_l37fmcs,1cndy74,"My last fibroscan was 5 years ago and was 5.6.  Normal range is 2 to 7 and average is 5.2.  At end of treatment it was 12.7….just getting cirrhotic.

They don’t follow up any more, they only did follow up appointments because I was on an experimental Hep C drug.  Standard care for Hep C patients was very poor when I was being treated, so I signed up for a research program with Kings College hospital in London.

With my current knowledge, I may not have done that.  But I trusted they would fix it 😬

I did get the best diagnostics and doctors there though.  Standard care they just use ultrasound to scan the liver, which isn’t good enough.  When I had mine, they said it was fine.  3 weeks later after a fibroscan, they were apologetic about the diagnosis because my liver was compromised and promising they’d do all they could. 🤷‍♀️

So, good in some ways…..but heaven only knows what I took for 6 months.",😬🤷♀

In hindsight I think I would have benefited from just diving in rather than transitioning slowly.  So that’s what I would advise.

Go to basics…fat, meat and water only.  Once you’ve stabilised on that you could start adding different foods in to see what effect it has.  But one food at a time otherwise you won’t be able to distinguish the problematic food.",
lqw4inq,t1_lqv6b0q,1cndy74,"So 3 weeks isn’t long.  I had a lot of tummy upsets for a year on and off.

What do you eat that isn’t steak, eggs or bone broth?

Also, bone broth is full of histamines, so you may be sensitive to that.

It sounds like you may not be eating enough too.  How much in weight are you eating daily…meat and fat?

Don’t be afraid of eating until you’re thanksgiving dinner stuffed, even if you’re trying to lose weight.

The CRUCIAL golden rule I wish I’d learned earlier, is if things are going wrong….go back to the basics…

Meat, fat and water ONLY.

Don’t add stuff or take supplements, it complicates things too much.  As long as you’re eating enough things should fall into place.",

I definitely don’t want to put weight on. But want to keep slim and toned

I usually have a steak at breakfast with 6 eggs. Dinner roughly the same and this makes me feel pretty full.

I don’t take any supplements since starting. I came from a low carb keto diet 

Just feel bloated and like I’m retaining water. 

I train 5days a week mainly weights.",

l38nvra,t1_l37iat8,1cndy74,Grass fed/ finished and even unaged beef.  So I don’t know what the issue is really.  I say histamines because it starts with itchy eyes and sneezing but unaged beef shouldn’t have any more histamines than lamb….so maybe it’s something else.,

I can’t stress enough how much eating a lot on this woe will not make you fat or put on weight.  If anything, the more fat you eat, the more weight you’ll lose.  Fat is thermogenic.

But histamines cause bloating so maybe knock the bone broth on the head for a while and see if it gets better.",

Since taurine is heat sensitive and not found in plants, its only found in RAW meat, which almost everyone on earth overcooks their meat, resulting in a global taurine epidemic.

6 x eggs and around 150g sirloin steak with the fat that’s on it.

I do love working out, so weights is my favourite and I do the stepper once a week. 

But at the moment I’m not feeling comfortable, don’t like my clothes feeling tighter and stomach bloat.
