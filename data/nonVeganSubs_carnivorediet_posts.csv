carnivorediet,"14 years ago today, I signed off my will and went to make funeral plans.  Doctors had nothing to offer except maybeâ€¦.. a big maybeâ€¦.a liver transplant when my liver failed.

Other than that, a slow decline to deathâ€¦.maybe 5 years, maybe more or less.  Trouble was, I was only 47 and not ready to get my coat.

I found George Henderson on the forum Iâ€™d joined, who told me the quickest path to health was keto. And he was right and Iâ€™ve never looked back.

I was keto for about 9 years and now carnivore for 4 1/2.  Still have some issues, my electrolytes are a bit skittish and I struggle to maintain weight.

I canâ€™t eat beef because of the histamines, so Iâ€™m a lamb and salmon eater with buffalo/goats milk and beef suet.  

So here I am at 61.  I swam 5 miles in Ullswater yesterday, been hiking miles this week.  A photo of me on the 60th birthday I thought Iâ€™d never have.

Excuse the scary eyes in this, Iâ€™m not a selfie expert.

So, yeahâ€¦..up yours big pharma ðŸ–•",They were wrongâ€¦..,t2_ckh3xiptt,0.96,1154,1715198630.0,1715198630.0,233,Done-with-work,1cndy74
