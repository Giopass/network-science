lmzpj0o,t3_1fg4sjz,1fg4sjz,"Those are vegan lions, Instead of eating boars and zebras they look for vegan alternatives instead.",
ln14hx4,t3_1fg4sjz,1fg4sjz,"I was just explaining this on another sub where it showed two eagles wolfing down chicken chicks, that vegans have Disney lenses on and don’t understand that there’s predators way crueler at killing their prey than humans.",
lmzo7j2,t3_1fg4sjz,1fg4sjz,This will never not be the funniest thing I’ve seen so far,
ln10x3b,t3_1fg4sjz,1fg4sjz,"""Hey Marty, thanks again for letting us eat you after you die.""",
ln0k2po,t3_1fg4sjz,1fg4sjz,We commend your scarifies for our children Mr Zebra. Thank you.,
lndrr9u,t3_1fg4sjz,1fg4sjz,Best anti vegan award goes to you,
ln22owq,t3_1fg4sjz,1fg4sjz,"I almost never laugh at these kinds of posts, but holy shit that’s hilarious.",
ln1qh29,t3_1fg4sjz,1fg4sjz,"If they arranged a funeral for a chicken before, then its true what this picture says.",
ln7zkiv,t3_1fg4sjz,1fg4sjz,I saw a comment online from a vegan saying how evil and unfortunate it is that animals kill each other to survive. They said that carnivores had been cursed and were forced to be evil and that nature designed them wrong. Uhh what? You can’t argue or debate with nature? It’s just how the world works,
lnkys8l,t3_1fg4sjz,1fg4sjz,"Lol animal liberationists (openly vegans) always believe in Disney fairy tales from a babies to their ripe old age

![gif](giphy|bC9czlgCMtw4cj8RgH)",
ln55z1v,t3_1fg4sjz,1fg4sjz,😹😹😹😹,😹😹😹😹
ln6x35u,t3_1fg4sjz,1fg4sjz,Wait your telling me animals dont die like this in the wild. Lions aren’t vegan. Who knew,
ln11vjd,t3_1fg4sjz,1fg4sjz,"I like to follow subs with viewpoints differing from my own to understand both sides of arguments (why I follow republican subs etc) usually I stay quiet and just lurk….but I just can’t. this sub is ridiculous lmao. Like, you don’t actually think that a single vegan thinks this… do you?",
ln02jik,t1_lmzpj0o,1fg4sjz,"That is the world that vegans are striving for! Unfortunately (for them), it will always remain a fantasy.",
ln1sqhw,t1_ln14hx4,1fg4sjz,Show them the good old crocodile spin of death into drown/neck break combo,
ln1o7kt,t1_ln14hx4,1fg4sjz,Komodo Dragons come to mind.,
lo4ib4y,t1_ln10x3b,1fg4sjz,Great film! 😆,😆
lo4id1x,t1_lndrr9u,1fg4sjz,"Thanks, I guess 😜",😜
ln3dpma,t1_ln1qh29,1fg4sjz,"That funeral will go down in history, for sure! 😆",😆
lnpueov,t1_ln7zkiv,1fg4sjz,"Yeah, next time they'll debate who's the better mayor of Funky Town🤣🤣🍖🍗",🤣🤣🍖🍗
lnamn17,t1_ln6x35u,1fg4sjz,"Unfortunately not, it seems! 🤷‍♂️😆",🤷♂😆
ln220js,t1_ln11vjd,1fg4sjz,"You should know, that this sub actually has a sense of humour 😜",😜
ln1r359,t1_ln11vjd,1fg4sjz,You wouldn't say the same when you realise vegans have uploaded on youtube videos of themselves giving public lectures in which they assert vegans must also try to reduce the suffering endured by wild animals at the hands of their predators and their aggressive mates!!!,
ln1ppcs,t1_ln11vjd,1fg4sjz,So you are a vegan republican ? Something doesnt feel right...,
ln6evnw,t1_ln11vjd,1fg4sjz,"I don't think they think that vegans think this, they just think that this thought of vegans thinking this would be funny.",
ln7gl9t,t1_ln11vjd,1fg4sjz,"Sorry. There must have been a misunderstanding. Never at any point did I think that vegans ""think"". Of course that is preposterous.",
ln9zheb,t1_ln11vjd,1fg4sjz,Never heard of satire? Or that it can use exaggeration?,
ln72ra1,t1_ln02jik,1fg4sjz,"Because animals eating animals, is a instinct for most animals
Even in chickens",
ln2h7cq,t1_ln1sqhw,1fg4sjz,Oh yeah the crocodile death roll. Yep they do that to rip meat off or drown and break bones on their prey.,
ln2h8t7,t1_ln1o7kt,1fg4sjz,I mentioned that actually.,
ln6ejod,t1_ln1o7kt,1fg4sjz,Pretty sure Komodo Dragons inject their preys with poison and let them slowly and painfully die from it. Then they smell their prey and eat them,
ln222os,t1_ln1r359,1fg4sjz,“Send bears to jail” was one of my favourite quotes— from Vegan Gains himself 😆,😆
ln1r5x7,t1_ln1ppcs,1fg4sjz,"Nah dog…read my comment, it’s the opposite. But what if I told you I am friends with more than a few young, gay republicans? Would your head explode?",
ln9s1et,t1_ln6ejod,1fg4sjz,They often eat them alive too after poisoning them. It’s brutal.,
ln6f116,t1_ln222os,1fg4sjz,Wait actually? Was it sarcastically or was he dead serious? Can you send me the clip?,
ln1thw9,t1_ln1r5x7,1fg4sjz,"From the looks of it, it doesnt look that you are an anti-vegan either, which is quite suspicious... I'd say that if all it takes is to have a few republican gays in your pocket, why bother coming here in the first place ?",
lnh3tqb,t1_ln9s1et,1fg4sjz,Yet vegans still think that harmlessly gathering eggs from a chicken is worse than that.,
lo4ijbw,t1_ln6f116,1fg4sjz,He was dead serious. It was with a debate with Jimbob on YouTube. The crucible.,
