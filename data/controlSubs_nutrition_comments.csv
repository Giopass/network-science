Discussion in this subreddit should be rooted in science rather than ""cuz I sed"" or entertainment pieces. Always be wary of unsupported and poorly supported claims and especially those which are wrapped in any manner of hostility. You should provide peer reviewed sources to support your claims when debating and confine that debate to the science, not opinions of other people.

**Good** - it is grounded in science and includes citation of peer reviewed sources.  Debate is a civil and respectful exchange focusing on actual science and avoids commentary about others  

**Bad** - it utilizes generalizations, assumptions, infotainment sources, no sources, or complaints without specifics about agenda, bias, or funding. At best, these rise to an extremely weak basis for science based discussion. Also, off topic discussion  

**Ugly** - (removal or ban territory) it involves attacks / antagonism / hostility towards individuals or groups, downvote complaining, trolling, crusading, shaming, refutation of all science, or claims that all research / science is a conspiracy

But ya, all those other places act like they have a fiber allergy that can only be cured with grease.",
kjx7wqc,t3_1acvhko,1acvhko,El Pollo Loco isn’t bad if you stick to the chicken and sides. Chick-fil-A has some healthy options as well.,
kjx2grd,t3_1acvhko,1acvhko,Those fit meals plans are becoming pretty popular. You can order as much as you want and get it delivered to your house. Keep a few in the fridge for nights you don’t feel like cooking. Test out a few of them see which on you like don’t like so you’ll know what to keep around the house,

Pretty sure it's healthier than most vegan fast-food such as beyondmeat burgers. But yes, I also do often wish we have access to rapid healthy food on the road. I hope it will change in the future. I don't understand how fast-food restaurants are surviving theses days with the increasing cost and the common knowledge about nutrition.",

kjxo38o,t3_1acvhko,1acvhko,"When I was not trying to gain weight / was trying to lose weight I found Starbucks to be one of the few decent options. Egg bites / egg white breakfast wrap / turkey bacon breakfast sandwich with some apple chips on the side was ""okay"" enough for a quick brunch / lunch in a pinch. 

Not healthy, but healthier.",
kjxo9bh,t3_1acvhko,1acvhko,It’s extremely frustrating that all the west coast healthy fast food chains just assume ALL people in the Midwest WANT to eat like shit. No. It’s because we aren’t even given any other options.,
kjyjmvg,t3_1acvhko,1acvhko,"Subway is unbelievably bad tasting—sawdust with day old chopped red onion, no matter what you order and I refuse to eat it unless it’s only thing offered at business meetings run by sociopaths.  I live in a similar food dessert,not many options for eating out that aren’t serving deepfried heart attacks even when dining in with servers.  I have to request that my grilled  chicken and vegetables be drained thoroughly at my local cantina. Yep I’m in the south. Im betting you’re looking for after work not get out of the car into the frigid temps and wind chill after a long day healthy options, and your pizza places dont have a salad option just variations on the same prefab pizza crust that add lots of fat or sugar to the party. Your best bet is probably take out from appleby’s if you’re lucky,  or stop off at a grocery and see what hot food or cut veggies they have and or order that for grocery pick up, provided you can anticipate when you’re gonna have one if those days.My town of 6000 does have walmart and a local grocery with pickup options at minimum.  There is nothing else available other than Wendy’s that remotely fits your criteria.  

Sometimes I get drive thru chicken tenders from  somewhere and just throw it together with salad greens and whatever veggies I have on hand that don’t require intensive prep.  Best I can do to avoid eating something worse.

Those who know know, those throwing shade could consider an empathetic pov as an alternative.",
kjxqxlc,t3_1acvhko,1acvhko,By design fast food has to be low in fibre so it's less likely to go off and can stay frozen for long times.,

kk04434,t3_1acvhko,1acvhko,Chipotle! Some have drive thrus. You can order ahead.,
kjx16mu,t3_1acvhko,1acvhko,Why does it have to be drove through? There are SO many healthy casual takeout places. You can call ahead so it’s ready when you get there and pick it up. That’s arguably even faster than a drive through. Al Wazir is one example. California chicken cafe is another - you can order online and drive up to the curb and they’ll hand you your order.,
kjxb788,t3_1acvhko,1acvhko,Seems like it is time to open a salad to go franchise around your way,
kjy0yrv,t3_1acvhko,1acvhko,When we got a Panera I thought it would be a good option but it seems they're unable to recruit and train staff properly. Got some dicey takeout a fww times even though the food is pretty simple so I just keep the freezer stocked with batch cooking so I can always have a meal ready fairly quickly when I don't feel lije cooking a full meal,
kjy254f,t3_1acvhko,1acvhko,The reason they only exist in a few large cities is that anywhere else they'd go belly up in a month. The demand simply isn't there.,
kjy8aad,t3_1acvhko,1acvhko,"My go to’s are Panera for salad and soups, chipotle for salad or burrito bowls, Boston market for their sides (steamed veggies and chicken), kfc has pretty good grilled chicken, I also like to stop at the hot food bar at Whole Foods.

kjyhrsf,t3_1acvhko,1acvhko,"We are in the PNW. In the Seattle area, we have Taco Time. It isn’t ideal, but they have some reasonably healthy salads and fat free beans. You can also get a grilled chicken wrap on a whole wheat tortilla. I feel your pain. My wife and I both have careers and two young kids. At the end of the day, cooking sometimes is the last thing I want to do.",
kjymwbl,t3_1acvhko,1acvhko,"Pollo Tropical came to my state for a few years and its my favorite fast food place. Then i lived in miami for a bit and got it all the time, i miss it every day",
kjyn3hh,t3_1acvhko,1acvhko,"the unhealthy stuff is addictive and cheap - I agree with you, but I also get why it's less available. Have you tried batch cooking so you have something ready on-hand throughout the week?",
kjytero,t3_1acvhko,1acvhko,"I'm with you. The best I can suggest is Panda. You can eat decently healthy there without rice or noodles. Bugs me they insist on calling their vegetables ""super greens"" but that's besides the point.",
kjywxe5,t3_1acvhko,1acvhko,"I’ve seen a reel that combines the 
Chik-fil-A kale salad with their grilled chicken as a nutritious meal. I haven’t tried it bc I always think about getting it on a dang Sunday.",
kjz0eds,t3_1acvhko,1acvhko,"Haha! True.

I see so many people order Chicken Ceasar Salad wraps because they think they are a healthy option. [https://www.wendys.com/en-uk/menu-items/caesar-chicken-salad](https://www.wendys.com/en-uk/menu-items/caesar-chicken-salad) \- more than half the calories are from fat.",
kjzqi19,t3_1acvhko,1acvhko,Wouldn't ordering pickup at a restaurant essentially be what you're looking for?,

kk6er4r,t3_1acvhko,1acvhko,I often thought about this. Why can't I get a banana in a drive-thru?,
kk71juw,t3_1acvhko,1acvhko,"Sometimes I'll hit drive thru Panera and get the pick 2 salad and sandwich. 

That said, a drive thru shawarma chain is the biggest missed opportunity ever.

There's a very legit drive thru sushi place in my part of town, run out of an old Brusters. It's really no slower than a poorly staffed McDonald's at peak. So if anyone has dreams of a drive thru sushi place, there's your proof of concept.",
kk7krt7,t3_1acvhko,1acvhko,100%.  Why is this such a difficult thing to do?  It is not that complicated.  Chipotle is the only decent fast food that doesn’t make me feel like shit after eating it.  There’s also a poke bowl place near me that makes healthy food but it is super expensive.,
kq2xwe4,t3_1acvhko,1acvhko,"Suggest making use of doordash and ubereats with nearby asian/indian/vegetarian restaurants.  Most of the above places have simpler, lower cost menu items. Or, order ahead and swing by on your way home to save more.

It may also be fun for you to get into cooking your own healthy meals. Example: make sesame tofu and wok vegetables  with brown rice and make enough for several meals to reheat or, once good at it, invite folks over for dinner and games.",

kjxqonu,t3_1acvhko,1acvhko,You could purchase milk off the kids menu if you're looking for something healthy at a fastfood restaurant.,
kjx3zzo,t3_1acvhko,1acvhko,I go to McDonald’s and get the 2 for 1 double cheeseburgers through the app then I throw the bread away. The macros are basically perfect on it and it only costs 3 dollars.,

la0bri2,t3_1acvhko,1acvhko,I live by a drive through called robbery juice co. It’s actually pretty damn healthy and it I tasted great,
kjy8zi6,t3_1acvhko,1acvhko,You can get a grilled chicken sandwich from most fast food/quick service places (and even KFC). Or getting something like a nugget happy meal from McDonald's is <500 calories and comes with apple slices and milk. Some even offer grilled nuggets now. If you ask for no sauce on the chicken sandwich you save a ton on calories. You really just need to look at the various menus for healthier options.,
kjy1x2z,t3_1acvhko,1acvhko,If you're trying to loose body fat then you're real enemy is calories.,
kjy3lgv,t3_1acvhko,1acvhko,"Chick fila has grilled chicken sandwiches, fruit, salads and grilled nuggets I lived off them for the same reason. If you don’t have self control at the drive thru you’re screwed anyway",

kjxzwkt,t3_1acvhko,1acvhko,Take the fried batter off the fried chicken and it's not much different than any other chicken.  So maybe try the fried chicken place since you don't have other options.  I know for sides there isn't many options because those places also have terrible sides .,

kjx9h84,t3_1acvhko,1acvhko,"The nice thing about the Cincinnati Area is that the chili parlors usually have some kind of Deli Menu in addition to Cincy style chili. 

So the closest one to me has greek salads at the drive through. Other salads also, but the greek one is dang healthy. 

But weirdly the closer the chain gets to big time franchise (im looking at you skyline) the less likely it is to retain the Greek Immigrant menu and instead have burritos and chili fries.",
kjx9u30,t3_1acvhko,1acvhko,"Agreed. I visited some family in Arizona last month and was pleasantly surprised to learn about Salad And Go. We have Modern Market Eatery which I think is similar but I still wish there were more creative options outside the realm of salads, wraps, and sandwiches.",

The grocery store would have to maintain profitability while the drive thru portion would have a small selection of in store made grab and go items that could also be picked up inside. Think a deli/salad counter that makes everything prepackaged and you can either order through the window or walk in.

There is a new Mediterranean restaurant near me called Garbanzo which seems to offer a lot of fresh options. Mediterranean food is a popular diet right now as it’s lower carb, higher fiber, full of omega-3s and “superfoods”, and less common proteins that people don’t often get in the Midwest like fish and vegetable proteins. Premade Mediterranean dishes would be an excellent option for a drive thru add-on to a grocery store. I could see Hyvee doing this along with their already large menu of premade in store options.",

I’m not rich so my concept is vague.

This is the situation in most vice businesses. Beer commercials advertise like all their customers are groups of friends enjoying a cold one on the weekends, but in reality, the vast majority of their business is from chronic, problem drinkers. One person buying a case of beer a day drinks WAY more than an entire party of occasional drinkers.

kk3yje4,t3_1acvhko,1acvhko,"Yeah honestly it may depend on where you live but in general eating out is a no-fly zone if you’re trying to be healthy. I know it doesn’t save the work in preparing it but if I were you I would focus a lot on meal prep so that dinner is already cooked when you come home from work. At least that way you’re not doing it in a stressed tired state after a full day of work. Take an hour or two on a day off and cook a whole rack of chicken breast, ground beef chop up all your Rob veggies. Do crockpot meals once or twice a week so that it’s literally hot and ready for you when you walk in the door. I feel like most people who eat really healthy either put in a lot of work in the planning or they eat really simple meals. It doesn’t have to be complicated to be healthy either.",
kk41w63,t3_1acvhko,1acvhko,">Sometimes after a long hard day you just want someone to do the cooking for you and go home.

This is why, instead of waiting until you've had a long hard day at work, you meal prep on the weekends and then have stuff you can easily [reheat](https://reheat.My). My wife and I make all kinds of burritos, for example: Bean burritos, a chicken, vegetable & rice burrito, and breakfast burritos. We'll make a couple dozen of each at a time. Then it's a simple matter to reheat and you have a healthy meal.

Whenever I make pasta, I usually make a bunch of it and refrigerate the leftover pasta which can then be used with sauce, pesto, or whatever, in the following days. When pasta cools, the starches turn into resistant starch and remain so, even after reheating, meaning that it acts a lot like high fiber food (you don't get as much sugar and the resistant starch feeds beneficial gut bacteria).

When we buy mushrooms, onions and green peppers, the first thing we do is chop them all up, and put them in containers in the freezer, where they'll be good for months (not that they ever last that long). If I want to make eggs with vegetables, I simply grab a handful from the freezer and throw it in a skillet with some oil, sautee the veggies, and then scramble an egg into it. Or I'll throw the vegetables into some of that leftover pasta with some pesto or some butter, or maybe some cream, whatever.

It's all about making it really easy to come up with a quick, healthy meal in a matter of minutes.",

kk66dgg,t3_1acvhko,1acvhko,"It's possible to eat out healthy, it's just way harder and, more importantly, WAY more expensive.

For example, the **grilled** nuggets at Chick-fil-a are actually pretty good for you. Low carbs and high protein.

You just need to make sure you don't ruin it with a soda, fries, or sauces and are willing to pay $20 dollars for 2 orders since they are very lean and do NOT fill you up.

Naked traditional wings at Buffalo Wild Wings aren't bad either. Emphasize ""naked"" and ""traditional"" since the sauces and boneless breading add tons of carbs and sugar.

As for non-meat items, I'm not sure it's worth it. Many of the salads you can get have unhealthy dressings or additives on them and if you take all that off then you are just overpaying for something you could craft in a few minutes from fresh produce.

Also, just out of curiosity...are you vegetarian or vegan? That's fine if you are I was just confused why you listed ""veggie tacos and veggie stir fry"" as your idea of a healthy food.

Edit: but to add-on, the person blaming capitalism, if there was no cheap, corporate fast food, how much cheaper would vegetables and quality meat be?
If anything, capitalism has made food cheaper by having farmers come up with more innovation to produce higher crop yields or more efficient methods of mechanization. Part of that is you end up with factory farms for produce and livestock but then it lives an open market for people that want to spend more money on higher quality goods and farmers that want to produce higher quality goods.",

Ultimately, Capitalism, provides us with goods and services, which can actually enable us, the people, to choose to buy what we actually want, and need... 

The problem is, that many buisness/capitalist don't want to put in work anymore, because their returns/profits, will just not be financially worth it, to them...  For there are other big scale capitalist that are dominating the markets... And fortunately, for us? The larger scale buisness, can afford to produce at a much lower cost, making everything cheaper!

Sodium bicarbonate, or baking soda, also contributes to sodium levels. Same with various preservatives like sodium nitrate.  MSG, or MonoSodium Glutamate, as I'm sure you can tell by the name, also includes sodium.

Now, you can use MSG to actually REDUCE sodium levels if you use it in place of table salt as it has a stronger effect on the flavor of food than salt alone allowing you to consume less sodium and get similar flavor profiles. But most take out foods from Chinese restaurants that use MSG will also use a ton of salt in general.  

Frankly, that's not limited to Chinese take out by any means, most restaurants use far more fat, salt and sugar in their dishes than you would at home, because it makes for a more flavorful dish.",
