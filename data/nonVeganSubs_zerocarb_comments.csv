kz4q5fv,t3_1c1nw98,1c1nw98,"you might be interested to know there's a care home which uses carnivore and ketogenic diets  .... they've had people come in unable to walk and being able to leave later. also people who are still in the community but have gone from being in a wheelchair to being able to get around with a walker. 

hold on, I'll get their twitter accountname, 

here it is, it is a 10-bed assisted care facility in Arizona, [https://twitter.com/HalCranmer](https://twitter.com/HalCranmer) 

here's someone who is still in assisted care, but was able to walk again [https://x.com/HalCranmer/status/1649082369343913984](https://x.com/HalCranmer/status/1649082369343913984)

kz7y9i9,t3_1c1nw98,1c1nw98,Congratulations good to hear you are getting results with zerocarb,
kzac93n,t3_1c1nw98,1c1nw98,"Good for you! I started with very low carb about 12 years ago when I was 64...gradually shifting towards keto. I'm probably closer to ketovore now...there's still a few non animal foods I'd miss. But, with more meat and very few carbs in my diet I'm gradually reducing inflammation. It works!",

l51kdil,t3_1c1nw98,1c1nw98,"I'm a 73 yr old female who is just starting. I tried it once before, and I failed because I didn't transition, just jumped right in and the keto flu kicked up my lupus so badly, I had to quit. I'm ready to do a slow transition now to avoid most of the keto flu symptoms. 

Good to hear about the brain function, because even though I had a brain MRI and was told there is nothing wrong with my brain, I feel like I'm demented sometimes. The cognitive effects is one reason I'm determined to do this.",
l0z4gnw,t1_kz4q5fv,1c1nw98,"had to add this one, which I just saw, 

""This guy came to us 7 months ago on Hospice with Parkinson’s and Alzheimer’s. He could barely stand up and was non-verbal. Today his wife texted me: “XXX filled in some on his medical report and then signed his name AND separated tge 2 pages, leaving the carbon with the nurse and bringing the original to me.” For his full story check out[u/BrianLenzkes](https://twitter.com/BrianLenzkes)podcast. Big shout out thanks to[@MariaEmmerich](https://twitter.com/MariaEmmerich)and[@emmerich\_craig](https://twitter.com/emmerich_craig)for their nutrition advice on his [#carnivore](https://twitter.com/hashtag/carnivore?src=hashtag_click) diet! And yes for the Karen’s out there we received full permission from the family and POA to post this. 1st picture was when he came to us. Rest are from today.""

kz9t9wv,t1_kz4q5fv,1c1nw98,WTAF     How old are you ?  And why the fuck would you presume a person who posts here is looking for a CARE HOME ?  OMG.,

l51kqej,t1_l0z4gnw,1c1nw98,Wow! That is amazing!,
kzacyqx,t1_kz9t9wv,1c1nw98,"it was an illustration of ""never too old to start""    

 the people at that home had expected what the standard of care brings: they went in needing assisted care and expecting progressive decline and continuing to need ever higher levels of assisted care. .    

but instead, they had  substantial improvements, including some able to leave the home.    

ps: OP being 84, they are likely very familiar with some of her cohort having to go into assisted care, especially if she is in the US, where the disability free life expectancy is 15 years shorter than it is for eg France.  

 OP's age is the average age to go into assisted care,  with about 1/3 of the people in assisted care being younger, between 75 - 84.  

 tbqh, not sure why my talking about the results they were getting at that home upset you so much. ",
