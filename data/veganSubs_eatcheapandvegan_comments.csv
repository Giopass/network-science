**Veganism is not a diet**. However, there is a ton of misinformation and misunderstanding about the cost of **eating vegan** and this subreddit exists to hopefully dispell those false claims. Be advised submissions containing expensive processed food items will be removed.



**Definition of veganism:** *Veganism is a philosophy and way of living which seeks to exclude‚Äîas far as is possible and practicable‚Äîall forms of exploitation of, and cruelty to, animals for food, clothing or any other purpose; and by extension, promotes the development and use of animal-free alternatives for the benefit of animals, humans and the environment. In dietary terms it denotes the practice of dispensing with all products derived wholly or partly from animals.*

kof9ku4,t3_1afoybe,1afoybe,"Yummmm!! The cauliflower wings though üòç üò© 
The Curry & mashed potato recipes look really good... 
I especially love the use of cilantro. 
I really hate being plant based & despising mushrooms.. I have tried all different kinds & cooked them all different ways & just CANNOT. It's unfortunate because many vegan/vegetarian meals are often centered around mushrooms. Potatoes will forever have my heart though. 
I've been following a blogger/site called Cookie & Kate the last 7 years (all her recipes are wfpb but have both vegeterian & vegan mods) & there's a recipe called Crack Broccoli Tacos that has been mine & my kiddos favorite for years- we just use a homemade tortillas & BBQ sauce. I don't get on IG anymore but I definitely miss pictures like this bc they inspire me. 
Congrats to your wife & kudos to you for giving her props! üëèüèº",üòçüò©üëèüèº

Ingredients:  
1 small cauliflower  
For the batter:  
1 cup flour (I used Schar Mix C for its finer texture; if not gluten-free, wheat flour works)  
1 cup water  
Salt  
Spices (black pepper, chili flakes, etc.)  
1.5 cups breadcrumbs (I used Schar)  
Sauce:  
2/3 cup tamari, coconut aminos, or regular soy sauce (if not gluten-free)  
1 tsp sesame oil  
1/4 cup rice vinegar  
1/4 cup agave syrup  
Chili flakes, garlic powder, onion powder, smoked paprika  
(Sometimes I add 1 tsp tomato paste but not always)  
1/4 cup water  
1 large tbsp cornstarch  
Black and white sesame seeds  
Instructions:  
Preheat the oven to 390¬∞F.  
Cut the cauliflower into small pieces.  
In a bowl, mix flour and water until it reaches a batter consistency (add water slowly to achieve the desired consistency).  
Coat cauliflower pieces in the batter and then dip them in breadcrumbs to coat.  
Place the coated cauliflower on a lined baking tray and bake for 25-30 minutes, preferably flipping them halfway through.  
Prepare the sauce by mixing all the sauce ingredients. In another bowl, mix water and cornstarch.  
Heat the sauce in a frying pan, then add the cornstarch mixture and whisk until the mixture thickens.  
Pour the baked cauliflower into the sauce, and add sesame seeds (generous serving)",

~~Many wines are processed with fish bladder~~",üòâ
kocce7s,t1_kobz7n0,1afoybe,"Same with the white rice‚Ä¶ I don‚Äôt say this to shame or anything, these meals look insanely delicious and nutritious, and no denying how much work goes in to preparing food like this regularly. I think a lot of people misunderstand the scope and spectrum of processed food and how to incorporate that understanding into their eating habits. Even homemade and hand rolled noodles are processed. The act of cooking and combine ingredients is processing them.",
kodco5l,t1_kobz7n0,1afoybe,Even the flour used to make the noodles would be processed. I used to not eat ‚Äòprocessed‚Äô and honestly went unhealthy from it till i realised everything was,

When I use processed I guess I mean the super processed food with lots of weird ingredients and conservants etc!",
kofd3b2,t1_kodco5l,1afoybe,"Unlesss we live in a farm I guess it¬¥s almost impossible! Processed can be ok, just depends on the process, I will even say that some processed modern food like superfoods and those super powders might be super good to our health despite ""processed""

We need to find a better term for the unhealhty ones!!",
