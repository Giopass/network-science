m30uv3r,t3_1hijze1,1hijze1,Why is the Lobster on top of the shell on top of the pasta? Why not just Lobster on pasta no shell lmao,
m325oca,t3_1hijze1,1hijze1,Is it just me or is stuff on your plate that you can't eat a bit annoying?  If the meat was still inside the tail then OK but serving up the empty tail?  What do I need that for?,
m38r2k9,t3_1hijze1,1hijze1,"I was scrolling on down really fast, and this looked like some weird alien shell fish. Coming back to comment and it still does.",
m3cur0c,t3_1hijze1,1hijze1,"This is visually, very unappetizing",
m3a3z4t,t3_1hijze1,1hijze1,"I like the chef on here that said, if it's not edible it doesn't get plated.",
m3aqr0c,t3_1hijze1,1hijze1,"It sounds delicious, although I would prefer it served without the shell.

I ain't got time for all that.

And maybe some saut√©ed asparagus for color.

Also I love that silverware. Where'd you get it?",
m37y79v,t3_1hijze1,1hijze1,Pass,
m3dj6n4,t3_1hijze1,1hijze1,A dish made for radio. üòµ‚Äçüí´,üòµüí´
m2zapwp,t3_1hijze1,1hijze1,"Full recipe: [https://servedwithrice.com/lobster-tails-garlic-butter-pasta/](https://servedwithrice.com/lobster-tails-garlic-butter-pasta/)¬†

**Ingredients (served 2):**

* 2x 0.5lbs lobster tails
* 150g dried pasta (I used Tagliatelle)
* 4 tbsp butter
* 1 tsp paprika
* Several cloves of garlic
* Salt, pepper and lemon juice to taste

**Instructions**

1. Preheat oven at 200C/400F, and bring a pot of water to boil.
2. Melt butter in a large skillet on low heat. Add garlic and stir occasionally, until fragrant.
3. Using a pair of kitchen shears, cut along the top shell of each lobster tail.
4. Carefully remove the meat from the shell, but leave it attached to the tail. Lift the meat through the cut you made, and lay it on top of the shell.
5. Brush butter from the skillet onto the lobster tails. Salt and pepper the lobster, then roast on the top rack for 10-12 minutes on 200C/420F.
6. While lobster is in the oven, boil pasta in salted water until al dente.
7. Once pasta is done, drain and add to the skillet with the remaining garlic butter. Toss to combine, along with a bit of reserved pasta water.
8. Assemble and serve.

Cheers!",

m4ryguk,t3_1hijze1,1hijze1,"I used to love to make lobster, it‚Äôs no longer my favorite dish since I‚Äôve developed allergies and it makes me sick even if I eat just a little! Even lobster bisque! I also continued to work at a seafood counter and had to keep serving (with gloves) even after I started noticing the allergies. I had to finish out my summer there and it was torture‚Äîit was a family member‚Äôs store so I was stuck with it, not a normal situation at all, most people have more options. Everyone there was nice about it, but it was so isolating and being completely devoid of all other options entirely. I am going to make this garlic butter pasta for a friend‚Äôs luncheon at school though, it looks simple enough!",

m3efujd,t3_1hijze1,1hijze1,"It looks totally fine to me, why people so judgement tho",
m31davq,t1_m30uv3r,1hijze1,Gordon Ramsay is asking the same question,
m38419r,t1_m30uv3r,1hijze1,To be fair it probably looks prettier that way lobster isn‚Äôt a very flattering meat outside of its shell,
m3edrbe,t1_m30uv3r,1hijze1,This is exactly what I thought until I realized it's not a restaurant plating.,
m3fk2b9,t1_m30uv3r,1hijze1,"Stacking. Layering what have you.
Aesthetic or inexperience. Dealers choice.
As a chef I don't like how it's presented but if an apprentice produced it I would be supportive",
m34rnm4,t1_m325oca,1hijze1,"I‚Äôll accept it on a plate, but on top of a pasta seems like a mortal sin. How am I supposed to manage a random shell on top of pasta and sauce?",
m3g1ck3,t1_m325oca,1hijze1,I mean technically you *can* eat the shell. I just don‚Äôt recommend it.,
m53yxrs,t1_m53ye97,1hijze1,"good point, I wondered the same

My guess is that because I laid open the lobster flesh, the top edge of the shell didn‚Äôt get much direct heat.",
m3bxmyz,t1_m38wfhv,1hijze1,I second this! Where is the spoon from??,
m39own1,t1_m38419r,1hijze1,"What are you supposed to do? Gaze lovingly into that shell while you try to scoop up pasta from underneath it and cutting the lobster on top of it?

A giant shell on your pasta you need to remove before eating serves no purpose at all in this case. Even for aesthetic reasons it's unappealing.",
m3a3l3c,t1_m38419r,1hijze1,"For pictures? Sure, I guess. But for practicality, no.",
m3fk8jt,t1_m38419r,1hijze1,"It can be depending on how yo shuzz it up. Presentation over function when it comes to plating for the weak minded. Inexperienced  and overworked or just be stoaked someone tried something and that's awsome.

Either way keep on keeping on and fuk the haters work till ya get it wrong

Drunk chef just got home",
m34vahc,t1_m34rnm4,1hijze1,Pick it up and set it aside anywhere on the 50% of unused plate.,
m53zli0,t1_m53yxrs,1hijze1,No that wouldn't make a difference once lobster is cooked it automatically turns red unless you got an albino lobster. Which what I'm thinking.,
m3behsi,t1_m39own1,1hijze1,"Totally on your side there, for home cooking it makes no sense outside of posting for likes. But from a restaurant perspective plating is an important part of the dish. Although you could surely find a way to make it pretty without the shell like a garnish or crust.",
m3bqyey,t1_m39own1,1hijze1,Idk some people say food has a visual side to it otherwise we‚Äôd all be eating some gray slop slapped and splattered onto a plate clinically separated into constituent parts. No doubt I‚Äôm sure you fall into that camp.,
m350brh,t1_m34vahc,1hijze1,Applying that logic it would be OK to send out a plate with any random item perched on top of the pasta.  If it's not part of my meal I'd prefer that it wasn't on my plate.,
m3ckcnk,t1_m3behsi,1hijze1,"Even from a restaurant perspective, this is a plating failure.

This isn't a proper implementation of ""garnish"".",
m3fpl0a,t1_m3behsi,1hijze1,if the meat is chopped properly im sure it could sit on top with that garnish and look pretty,
m3evxrr,t1_m3behsi,1hijze1,Having the tail in the shell next to the pasta would make 1000x more sense. That would be a way better way to plate it.,
m3rbeae,t1_m3fpl0a,1hijze1,The last thing you usually want to do with a lobster tail is chop it up. Serving the tail intact is what will let a restaurant charge a premium for a dish like this.,
