l956bg8,t3_1dip4zu,1dip4zu,The cake is Gretchen’s [Truly White Cake](https://www.gretchensveganbakery.com/vegan-white-cake-recipe/) (I just added sprinkles to the batter) and the frosting is her [American Buttercream](https://www.gretchensveganbakery.com/american-buttercream-recipe/). I made the cake balls with leftover cake and buttercream and I coated them in melted white chocolate chips from Enjoy Life.,

l9c0j1g,t1_l9bv2ua,1dip4zu,"Where I live, people sell custom cakes like this for birthday parties and parents gladly pay $70-$100 for cakes.  They market them on Facebook or Instagram.   Don't know that they would pay extra for vegan but if you are in a college town, there might be enough vegans to make it a selling point.  As a vegan grandmother, I would certainly love to be able to eat the cake at my granddaughter's birthday parties - but I usually decline.",

lspm6jx,t3_1g43p25,1g43p25,"OP,

Just tried this recipe. Thanks for posting.The beetroot made mine a vivid red.  I'd like to note the place where i went wrong.

I substituted the cashew for sunflower seeds (allergies), which i don't recommend. The sunflower flavor is stronger than i thought it would be. I also have found that my blender sucks so it came out a bit gritty. Next time i'll try tofu like you mentioned in another comment.",

lsogt8r,t1_lsobqrq,1g43p25,I guess you could use cornflour but I really recommend agar they have it in amazon and eBay you will use it loads,
lsptxr9,t1_lspm6jx,1g43p25,Heyyyy you're amazing by the way the Beetroot is optional if it wasn't for presentation purposes I wouldn't even add it. Sunflower seeds probably gave it a really earthy flavour like tahini I wish you would have told me first lol just pit tofu instead of the cashews (same weight) but we'll done for trying,
