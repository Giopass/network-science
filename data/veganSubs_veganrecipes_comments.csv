m768324,t1_m72jd1o,1hzb4do,"OK Relax. It‚Äôs a phrase. Yes, by virtue of just being alive, no matter how low impact we try to be, critters are going to die in the process. Just walking down the street, we likely step on and kill multitudes of ants, aphids, and other little insects. I got stung by a bee the other day and obviously the bee died. I suppose if we all just opt to die, then we will truly be cruelty free. I have no interest in dying at this point in my life. 

I do however have an interest in living as low impact at possible. To me this means walking or using transit wherever possible, buying locally sourced foods and other products where possible, living minimally, and not eating or using any animal product. This isnt me attempting to be righteous or virtuous, it‚Äôs just what keeps me going. 

You do understand that a meat eating diet kills far more animals as well I hope. The amount of grain that is needed to feed a cow, pig, or chicken to produce 1000 calories of meat is anywhere from 6 to 9 times more than the amount of land required to produce 1000 calories of just crops. So that‚Äôs 6-9 times more field mice, deer, birds, and other critters killed in the production of food stuffs for livestock than for a human that just ops to eat only crops. This isn‚Äôt to mention the livestock that is being slaughtered, and  mind the insane water usage. 

So no, the fact that even the most staunch vegan is going to kill animals as a byproduct of their existance hasn‚Äôt escaped me. But what has seemed to escape you is that the cruelty and environmental impact of a vegan is going to be far less than that of a meat eater.

OP is just saying that it's good to be eating burgers that are less harmful than what most burger eaters usually eat (non-roadkill animal burgers). That was the intent.

Out of raw curiosity, what was your point of ""correcting"" OP? I'm genuinely asking.",
m6t5ykc,t1_m6r6iov,1hzb4do,"That guy was called a doofus because they were using countering a scientifically true statement (animals have sentience) with a scientifically unproven statement (plants have sentience). The (relatively insignificant) debate regarding plant sentience is about a small minority of scientists ATTEMPTING to overturn the **current consensus** of plants **not** being sentient, they have not convinced the scientific community at large on that point yet. And that reason mostly rests upon the fact that plants lack a central nervous system, currently scientifically agreed upon to be required for sentience, and only merely **chemically** reacting to stimuli as opposed to the **existentially subjective and mostly mental** reactions that sentience involves. Not much different from bacteria or even a computer.

In this regard, an animal's sentience is several degrees more relevant than a plant's unconfirmed, scientifically heterogenous, and **arguably pseudoscientific** SUPPOSED ""sentience"". That's why they got called a doofus.",
m6t8awq,t1_m6t5ykc,1hzb4do,"Please explain to me how an animals sentience is more relevant than the one a plant could possibly have?

 I really want to understand your stand on this as it can help me understand the point of view of Vegans on the entire topic. Because, ill be real with you, thusfar this only sounds like hypocrisy, though I might just be missunderstanding",
m6t8udy,t1_m6t8awq,1hzb4do,"I already explained it. A **confirmation of harm** (animal sentience) is more important to worry about than a mere *teensy possibility* of harm (plant ""sentience"", which is only a mere concept so far). If you **have** to choose one or the other in order to stay alive, you choose the tiny possibility over the confirmation. Basic logic.",
m6uq5in,t1_m6t8udy,1hzb4do,"Next they‚Äôll tell us that this unproven plant sentience is enough to indicate we shouldn‚Äôt eat them, and then we‚Äôll all need to become breatharians",
