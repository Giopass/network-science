Plant Power also in Hollywood and Long Beach does their own rendition which I think tastes much better than the original. It’s much bigger and just tastes better as far as I’m concerned.

m768324,t1_m72jd1o,1hzb4do,"OK Relax. It’s a phrase. Yes, by virtue of just being alive, no matter how low impact we try to be, critters are going to die in the process. Just walking down the street, we likely step on and kill multitudes of ants, aphids, and other little insects. I got stung by a bee the other day and obviously the bee died. I suppose if we all just opt to die, then we will truly be cruelty free. I have no interest in dying at this point in my life. 

I do however have an interest in living as low impact at possible. To me this means walking or using transit wherever possible, buying locally sourced foods and other products where possible, living minimally, and not eating or using any animal product. This isnt me attempting to be righteous or virtuous, it’s just what keeps me going. 

You do understand that a meat eating diet kills far more animals as well I hope. The amount of grain that is needed to feed a cow, pig, or chicken to produce 1000 calories of meat is anywhere from 6 to 9 times more than the amount of land required to produce 1000 calories of just crops. So that’s 6-9 times more field mice, deer, birds, and other critters killed in the production of food stuffs for livestock than for a human that just ops to eat only crops. This isn’t to mention the livestock that is being slaughtered, and  mind the insane water usage. 

So no, the fact that even the most staunch vegan is going to kill animals as a byproduct of their existance hasn’t escaped me. But what has seemed to escape you is that the cruelty and environmental impact of a vegan is going to be far less than that of a meat eater. But I digress, perhaps the phase should be cruelty-light.",

And that reason mostly rests upon the fact that plants lack a central nervous system, currently scientifically agreed upon to be required for sentience, and only merely **chemically** reacting to stimuli as opposed to the **existentially subjective and mostly mental** reactions that sentience involves.

 I really want to understand your stand on this as it can help me understand the point of view of Vegans on the entire topic. Because, ill be real with you, thusfar this only sounds like hypocrisy, though I might just be missunderstanding",
m6t8udy,t1_m6t8awq,1hzb4do,"I already explained it.
