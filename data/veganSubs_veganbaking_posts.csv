VeganBaking,"A client’s order for her annual vegan Christmas party in our town last week! 100% vegan and made from scratch. Here I’ve made: 

An 8 inch triple layer vanilla cake, with vanilla bean buttercream and red currant and raspberry filling, 2 dozen double vanilla bean cupcakes and 2 dozen chocolate espresso cupcakes! 

Had the best time making this order for her, definitely one of my favorite clients! ❤️🎄✨",Vegan Christmas Cake order! ❤️🎄✨,t2_95enqma1,1.0,1041,1734444890.0,1734444890.0,65,GeneralMedicine8920,1hgbivm
