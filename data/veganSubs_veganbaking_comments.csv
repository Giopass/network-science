l96tc21,t3_1dip47t,1dip47t,"I love this so much! The contrast between the cheery, more minimalistic side and the side with the face is beautifully unsettling. Sincere compliment :)

It reminds me of body horror manga. It legit looks like the face of a creature from PTSD Radio or Jujutsu Kaisen.

Also, dang, props on the amount of skill that making the face must have taken! Did you sculpt the lips from frosting?",
l9738kn,t3_1dip47t,1dip47t,Would eating this violate the rule of not eating anything with a face? 😅,😅
l9871g7,t3_1dip47t,1dip47t,i don't think this is vegan anymore that thing is ALIVE and has seen some things......,

I’m new here and I’ve already gotten lots of pointers but I was wondering a few more things… How do you know how much batter to put in each pan so the layers are even? And then the same with the icing in between layers, how do you know how much to put? Do you have any go to recipes? Thanks again for blessing this feed lol",

l99ek10,t1_l964tag,1dip47t,"Following this comment, I need answers",
l9by1ec,t1_l95asvo,1dip47t,Vanilla funfetti and vanilla buttercream! Cake balls are made of the same cake but are coated in white chocolate,
l9bjlxb,t1_l97fczy,1dip47t,It WAS vegan.. before we sent it back to hell from whence it came,
l98744u,t1_l9871g7,1dip47t,however i love the fridge pic that had me dying,
l9be9et,t1_l999kkw,1dip47t,"I feel like I should have written a horror back story for this monstrosity 😅 it was my friend’s birthday recently and I volunteered to make a cake and I realized it had been over a year since I baked one. I wanted to do a funfetti cake because I hadn’t done one before, I can’t really say what possessed me to give it a face, but I took that fleeting thought and ran with it 😂",😅😂
leaq7ao,t1_leaij8o,1dip47t,"Thank you so much! I’m not a professional but I’m actually in the process of putting together a portfolio so I can try working at a bakery

As for the batter, I generally fill pans 1/2 or 3/4 of the way up. To make the layers perfectly even, I use my digital kitchen scale to weigh each pan. I’ll scoop a little out of one and put it in another in order to get them as close in weight as possible

For the frosting, it’s really a preference thing I think. I just kind of plop on enough so that it looks proportionate to me (cake layer thickness to frosting thickness). I know some people like to pipe their frosting onto and inside of the cake, that seems to help make it all a uniform thickness but I just wing it

The vast majority of my cake recipes are from Gretchen’s Vegan Bakery [on YouTube](https://youtube.com/@gretchensveganbakery?si=6yURcaSmv96rxYea). I’ve been following her for many years and I love everything she makes. Sometimes I’ll go months without baking and then she uploads a new video that inspires me",
l9bkg6v,t1_l979ji3,1dip47t,Now I’m wishing I had given it a pair of falsies and eyeshadow,
l9g5592,t1_l9by1ec,1dip47t,Thanks! The icing is so smooth - I can't wait till I can ice cakes and they don't look like a bad cement job 😅,😅
l9cm2ll,t1_l9be9et,1dip47t,I will definitely be in contact to commission you for all my future cake needs. This cake at a baby shower? A wedding? Yes. Yes.,
l9cnrvt,t1_l9cm2ll,1dip47t,I’m down! This at a baby shower would be hysterical,

m2jfl2h,t3_1hgbivm,1hgbivm,"This is absolutely stunning!!

Starting a tutorial channel is one of my goals! I’m so BAD with videos and editing though rofl. I’m slowly learning how to do all the technical stuff, and do plan to start posting my vegan cooking and baking tutorials down the line! 

Heehe the naked cake! I’m sure it still tasted divine! ❤️",💕❤
m2i8vh1,t1_m2i76qa,1hgbivm,"Thank you, kind stranger! ❤️✨",❤✨
m2nd2k1,t1_m2jwydk,1hgbivm,"Sure thing! ❤️

250g salted European style butter, 250g unsalted European style butter, 1-2 tbsp vanilla bean paste or vanilla extract, 1-2 tbsp creamy plant milk (go for oat, soy or cashew if you can), and 6-8 cups of powdered sugar. 

Using the paddle attachment for your mixer, cream your softened butter. Then add your vanilla. Add your powdered sugar one cup at a time, mixing well between each addition and scraping the sides and bottom of the bowl to prevent unmixed clumps. Add in your milk if you wish. 

The type of butter is the key ingredient here. If you can find Violife salted & unsalted butter, you’re golden. I find that no other vegan butter works nearly as well. The oils in other brands make them unable to hold their shape when decorating and also lend a more greasy/salty flavor. I think I’ve heard some good comments about Miyokos being a good alternative, but I’ve never personally tried making buttercream with it yet. 

I hope this helps! Happy baking love ❤️ ✨😊",❤❤✨😊

m2nay3m,t1_m2k5339,1hgbivm,Thank you! 🙏,🙏
m2nbpps,t1_m2kg2do,1hgbivm,"Sure! ❤️

I use: 250g unsalted European style vegan butter, 250g salted European style vegan butter, 1-2 tablespoons of vanilla bean paste or vanilla extract, 1-2 tbsp of a creamy plant milk of your choice (I prefer oat, soy or cashew), and anywhere from 6-8 cups of powdered sugar. The butter is the most important party here. Things like Earth Balance etc will not work well or taste good. If you can, get your hands on Violife butter or I’ve also heard good things about Miyoko’s. 

Cream your softened butter first, then add in your vanilla bean paste and 1 cup of powdered sugar at a time, beating well between each addition and making sure to scrape down the sides and bottom of the bowl. Add in your milk if you wish and mix well, this is optional though!

Use a paddle attachment on your mixer and not the whisk - I find the whisk creates tons of air bubbles which make for less smooth decoration and more need for patch fixing. 

I hope this helps 😊❤️✨",❤😊❤✨

m2mv2px,t1_m2jmfo8,1hgbivm,"I don’t know if you would like that, but I’m sure someone on this / other vegan subreddits could help with simple video editing, Especially if it’s for a good cause (supporting veganism)!
If I had video editing skills I would definitely help you with it!",
m2ps9dd,t1_m2nd2k1,1hgbivm,Does your buttercream stay firm and hold detailed piping if it’s at room temp for a while? I usually add shortening but sometimes my results are very inconsistent with earth balance sticks,
m2nayzn,t1_m2nay3m,1hgbivm,">Thank you! 🙏

You're welcome!",🙏
m2nneko,t1_m2nbpps,1hgbivm,Thank you for taking the time to write that out! I usually use earth balance for my buttercream and have never been super happy with the results so I am definitely giving this a try. Fingers crossed it turns out half as beautiful as this! 🤍,🤍

m2pu71g,t1_m2ps9dd,1hgbivm,"It absolutely does! This cake sat out for quite some time at room temp for a holiday party, and it did not become soft whatsoever by the end of the night.

m2ns7r6,t1_m2nneko,1hgbivm,Non-vegans have loved this frosting and not even noticed there was a difference at all! Crossing fingers (and toes!) that you have a similar success. Happy baking love ❤️,❤

m2rkz1m,t1_m2rhvjk,1hgbivm,Any recommendations on your recipe if I can only find the salted violife?,
m2rniec,t1_m2rkz1m,1hgbivm,"That happened to me with this order actually haha. For the chocolate cupcakes, I had to make the chocolate espresso buttercream using only salted butter and it turned out great, not salty at all. So you could easily get away with making a flavored buttercream and be fine. It may be more noticeable with a straight up vanilla, but it really depends on the salt content in the butter. Some brands contain more than others. 

Hmm. I have also heard good things about Miyoko's butter (it comes in both unsalted and salted as well) and Trader Joe's apparently has a European style butter too that's worth trying.",
