The facts are, toasting rice in various forms has been long done since Asia existed. There are many ways to roast rice of various kinds. There's not much fundamentally different between puffed rice held together by sugar versus something like roasted dango, which is only one of many forms of roasting rice. In that case, it's just a ball. On a stick.

Yes, put something on a stick and you can toast it above flames. Ingenius...

However, my grandfather's family (on my mom's side) traveled and put roots down in Missouri, basically, as soon as it was open to be done, and they all (to this day) say Missourah. When we had large family reunions I'd have to be careful to pronounce it ""correctly"" or risk getting an ear full about respect and side eyes for the rest of the day.",
