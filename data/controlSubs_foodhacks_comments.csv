l2assq7,t1_l27ab1p,1ci1iqp,"Real answer? People are terminally online with no big brain available.

The facts are, toasting rice in various forms has been long done since Asia existed. There are many ways to roast rice of various kinds. There's not much fundamentally different between puffed rice held together by sugar versus something like roasted dango, which is only one of many forms of roasting rice. In that case, it's just a ball. On a stick.

Yes, put something on a stick and you can toast it above flames. Ingenius...

The 'rice crispies treats/squares,' have added ingredients, which makes sense as to why those might be good heated up.
